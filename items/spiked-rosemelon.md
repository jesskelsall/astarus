## Summary

Spiked rosemelon is a type of cacti found only in the Kas'ran Desert. It is considered a delicacy to some in the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) due to its rarity and odd acquired taste. It tastes like rose petals crossed with lemon. Towards its top and bottom the sour taste is heightened, making those parts less appealing.

In the Kas'ran Desert itself it is seen as a blessing to underprepared travellers who don't bring enough water on their trek.

Popping up around the time of [the Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md), some believe that [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) brought spiked rosemelon with them. It embodies [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md)'s teachings due to its life saving nature and the perceived miracle that a plant so delicious could grow in such a hostile environment. Others explain away this theory by suggesting that the plant merely proliferated throughout the desert in the ensuing mass movement of elves to South [Kardan](../places/continents/kardan.md) in the wake of [the Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md).
