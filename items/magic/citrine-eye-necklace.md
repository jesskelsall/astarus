## Summary

The Citrine Eye Necklace is [Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)'s magical focus, loaned to [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md).

It grants +1 Wisdom to a spellcaster that attunes to it.

Additionally they gain access to whichever spell has been stored in it. A gifted Light or Knowledge domain Cleric can place a 1st level Cleric spell in the necklace by spending spell slots, the necklace gaining an amount of charges equal to the spell's level. This can be chained by spending multiple spell slots, but cannot exceed 10 charges. The wearer can cast the stored spell for the cost of one charge.

## History

The Citrine Eye Necklace was given to [Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) by her custodian, [Levron Udrexe](../../characters/levron-udrexe.md). It was a gift in the early days of her magical training, allowing her to master her divine powers more easily.

Allisa has always kept the necklace close, using it as her magical focus when casting spells. It remains a permanent fixture around her neck.
