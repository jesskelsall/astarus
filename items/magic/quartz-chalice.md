### Identified

> A quartz chalice about 1 foot in height, clear and glassy, comprised of flat edges that resemble a cut diamond. It is incredibly light and feels delicate to the touch due to its thin material, particularly on its upper half.
>
> When a healing spell is targeted at the chalice or it is within range of an area of affect healing spell, the chalice activates, casting a 3rd level [Moonbeam](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/moonbeam) that remains centred on the chalice, has a 10ft radius, and lasts for a number of turns equal to the amount of healing done divided by five. If the chalice is affected by another healing spell, the Moonbeam's duration is increased in the same way.
>
> After each time a healing spell activates or extends the chalice's Moonbeam, roll a d20. On a roll of 10 or less the chalice can no longer be affected by healing magic and shatters when its Moonbeam ends, rendering it useless. On a roll of 1, one of the shards is a diamond worth 300 gp.
>
> If the chalice rests upon one of the pedestals in the room in which it was found, the pedestal amplifies its power, extending the Moonbeam's radius to 15 feet.

## Summary

Quartz chalices can be found in the chalice trial room of [Devdaha Crypt](../../places/structures/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md). They were placed there by [Deorvys](../../characters/deorvys.md) to guard the crypt's final room from those who are not worthy, including startouched of insufficient ability. They are guarded by Chitine and while incredibly useful to solving the puzzle, are not required to progress to the next room.

If kept safe, the quartz chalices can be taken from the dungeon as loot and used in combat, though their fragile nature makes them limited use wondrous items.
