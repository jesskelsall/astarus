## Description

> *Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a Spellcaster)*
>
> A curious grey-blue dragon scale, 6 inches in size, with a metal chain threaded through a hole in the base of the scale. It is worn as a necklace.
>
> ***Lightning in a Bottle:*** The dragon scale can store up to 30 lightning damage. When lightning damage is stored or used, update this item's charges accordingly. Each charge represents 1 point of lightning damage stored. Every day the dragon scale loses 2d6 lightning damage, which harmlessly dissipates. Every time the dragon scale's stored lightning damage drops to 0, roll a d20. On a 1, the Blue Dragon Scale Necklace becomes an inert object with no ability to store or use lightning damage.
>
> ***Grounding:*** While wearing this necklace, the wearer has magical resistance to lightning damage. All lightning damage mitigated by this effect is stored within the dragon scale. The dragon scale shimmers a more vibrant blue the more lightning damage is stored.
>
> ***Overload:*** If **Grounding** would exceed the 30 lightning damage capacity storage of the dragon scale, this item immediately explodes from the overload of lightning coursing through it. Each creature in a 5ft radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The wearer automatically fails their saving throw.
>
> ***Lightning Arc:*** *Bonus Action, Concentration.* The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack with a metal weapon before the spell ends, this spell causes lightning to arc from the Blue Dragon Scale Necklace, through your weapon, to the target of the attack, and onwards into nearby creatures. In addition to the normal effect of the attack, the Blue Dragon Scale Necklace uses half of its stored lightning damage, rounded up. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet, excluding the wearer of the Blue Dragon Scale Necklace, take this lightning damage, distributed as you wish. The target of the attack must be distributed at least 1 lightning damage.
