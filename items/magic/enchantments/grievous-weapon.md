## Summary

The Grievous magical enchantment imbues a weapon with necrotic energy, allowing it to inflict greater wounds on a decisive blow. This benefit can backfire spectacularly when the weapon is fumbled clumsily.

The enchantment can only be applied to or found on metal weapons that deal slashing or piercing damage.
