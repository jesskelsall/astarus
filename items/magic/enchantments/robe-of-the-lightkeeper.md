## Description

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*
>
> This pale lime green ornate robe resembles a floor-length dress that hangs elegantly from the user. It is adorned with silver stitching around the hem, collar, and cuffs, in intricate repeating patterns.
>
> When casting a ranged spell you may expend an additional spell slot of the same level to increase its range by 25 times providing the following conditions are met:
>
> - The spell targets a point of your choosing, not a creature.
> - You can see the point the spell targets and a 10 foot radius around it.
>
> Additionally once per short rest you can cast the Levitate spell on yourself without expending a spell slot. You may rise vertically up to 60 feet, rather than the typical 20 feet.
