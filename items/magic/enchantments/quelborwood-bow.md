## Description

> When you make an attack roll using this magic weapon, roll a d8 and subtract it from the attack roll. If the attack hits, double the result of this dice and add it to the attack as cold damage. On a critical hit the result of this dice is quadrupled.

## Summary

Quelborwood Bows are magic weapons created using a combination of alpine wood from the Quelbor Forest and rare Quelbor Crystals found near the Quelbor Volcano. This unique combination creates bows that take much more effort to draw and aim, but infuse their shots with cold damage generated by the crystals.

Quelborwood Bows can only be shortbows or longbows and therefore deal piercing damage.
