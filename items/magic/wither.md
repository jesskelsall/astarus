## Summary

Wither is a [Grievous Weapon](enchantments/grievous-weapon.md), given to [Vētrall Astérr](../../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) by [Nacnar Morwesyrr](../../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md).

## History

Wither has travelled extensively with [Nacnar Morwesyrr](../../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md) as part of her adventuring career. An old favourite of hers, she kept it in good condition over the years. In combat she would typically favour her double-bladed scimitar.

Following [Vētrall Astérr](../../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) becoming a [Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) mentor and learning of their quest to find out more about [Mémoire de Défaite](../echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md), Nacnar gave Wither to Vētrall to "do as you please with".
