## Summary

Thistle is a [Quelborwood Bow](enchantments/quelborwood-bow.md) owned by [Hortense Bainbridge](../../characters/hortense-bainbridge.md).

## History

Thistle was created in Turnuroth by clan crafters that specialise in [Quelborwood Bows](enchantments/quelborwood-bow.md). It made its way into the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) via an adventurer that crossed the [Neum Flats](../../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/neum-flats.md).

After the adventurer met an untimely end, it was picked up by the [Astornar](../../organisations/government/astornar.md) who catalogued the magic weapon and offered it to members of the military that might have need of it through [Friend of the Magicborn](../../places/buildings/shops/friend-of-the-magicborn.md).

Eventually it was bought by [Hortense Bainbridge](../../characters/hortense-bainbridge.md) who was looking for an upgrade to her longbow.
