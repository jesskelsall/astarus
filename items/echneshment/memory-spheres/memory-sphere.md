# Memory Sphere

## Summary

Memory spheres are half clockwork, half [echneshment](../../../mechanics/magic/echneshment.md) magic devices that store memories of a particular time and place. They are used to relive the past for a variety of purposes ranging from studying a battle from different perspectives, to reliving precious family moments.

## Design

The typical memory sphere is 4 to 5 inches in diameter and made of a core of gold and platinum clockwork parts. This was then surrounded with a shell of gold, platinum, or extremely rarely, [stibnite](../../stibnite.md), forming a perfect sphere. Sometimes this sphere would be decorated with artistic relief.

## Usage

Arch-mages capable of using [echneshment](../../../mechanics/magic/echneshment.md) magic to a high degree used memory spheres to store their most precious memories.

For personal use, memory spheres were used to store magical knowledge, secrets, and memories of loved ones or favoured places.

Memory spheres were also used by some civilisations to store important events. These included coronations, state weddings, and even battles.

Once memories were stored, the spheres could be accessed at any time by any other arch-mage capable of reading it. This limited their mass appeal, but nonetheless their usefulness at perfectly recalling past events, examining it from different angles, and prodding at the memories to see how they react made them indispensable.

## Using a Memory Sphere

### Recording Memories

[Echneshment](../../../mechanics/magic/echneshment.md) magic is cast while holding an empty memory sphere. The magic channels the thoughts and senses from all nearby creatures through the caster and into the core of the sphere, writing it onto the mechanism. This process puts a heavy toll on the caster's body due to the amount of magical energy flowing through it.

Further understanding of [echneshment](../../../mechanics/magic/echneshment.md) magic allows arch-mages to record memories in a larger area and for longer before having to stop their channelled spell due to exhaustion.

At its maximum an area a mile in diameter could be recorded.

### Accessing Memories

Various [echneshment](../../../mechanics/magic/echneshment.md) magic techniques can be used to access the memories stored within.

Selective memories can be pulled out, projecting them into the surrounding area. The memory sphere will try its best to place this visage into appropriate surroundings. Through this technique an individual or specific detail can be examined, though prior knowledge of the memory is needed.

Alternatively the entire contents can be place in the surrounding area, fully immersing the caster and those nearby with the memories. The memory sphere will try its best to map them onto the terrain, creating a unique rendition of the memories each time that conform to the terrain and structures affected.

Finally, a riskier advanced technique can be used to transport a number of people into the memory sphere. This creates a pocket dimension linked to the inside of the sphere, transporting the people targeted by the magic inside until they fall unconscious. The memories arranged in this pocket dimension are as true to real life as possible, arranged just as they were during the recording.

## Rarity

Following [the Second Coming](../../../history/events/the-second-coming.md), few memory spheres made it to [Astarus](../../../celestial-objects/astarus.md), and the techniques for creating and accessing them have been largely forgotten. A tiny amount of elves that knew [echneshment](../../../mechanics/magic/echneshment.md) reached [Astarus](../../../celestial-objects/astarus.md), and those that do were unable to train many successors in the art due to its complexity and lack of spheres to practice on.

Those memory spheres that still exist are exceptionally prized and considered priceless artifacts. Those who make it their business to know of memory spheres have a short list of known ones to memorise.

### Ownership

Due to their rarity, many elves believe that memory spheres from Chausain are part of their cultural history, and as such should belong to them. This is a belief shared predominantly by the elves of the [Syntenne Republic](../../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), though others in the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) exist.

Other private collectors beg to differ, collecting them for their rarity and unique history, even if they don't have the means of accessing them.
