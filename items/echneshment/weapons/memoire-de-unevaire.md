## Summary

Mémoire de Unevaire is an elven sword originating in Chausain. It glows with the brightness of the full moon of [Unevaire](../../../celestial-objects/unevaire.md), the largest moon of [Oonar](../../../celestial-objects/oonar.md).

Mechanically Mémoire de Unevaire is a [Moon-Touched Longsword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/moon-touched-sword-longsword) / [+3 Longsword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/longsword-3).

## History

Mémoire de Unevaire was created using [echneshment](../../../mechanics/magic/echneshment.md), drawing on a person's memories of the moon to empower the blade.

*See: [Raine's Artifact](../../../campaigns/O2-raines-artifact.md)*

It was buried with its original owner in Dulsenn Crypt. In the year of the Fall of Chausain, [Copper Eye](../../../organisations/copper-eye.md) members raided the tomb for magical artifacts to take back to Chausain, finding the blade and taking it with them. Through this effort Mémoire de Unevaire made its way into the hand of an elf of Chausain.

During the Battle of Chausain, the sword was in the possession of an elf that was taken by [Malnesh](../../../gods/deities/malnesh.md) in [the Second Coming](../../../history/events/the-second-coming.md).

Later the sword found its way into the hands of [Vulpes Geen](../../../characters/vulpes-geen.md), who wielded it proudly while making an adventurer's name for himself.

Upon his death, the sword was bequeathed to his eldest son, [Vulpes Soon](../../../characters/vulpes-soon.md).
