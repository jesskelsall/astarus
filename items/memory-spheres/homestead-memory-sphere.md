# Homestead Memory Sphere

## Summary

The Homestead Memory Sphere is a [memory sphere](memory-sphere.md) containing the memories of an elven father returning home to his family cottage where he is greeted by his wife and daughter.

The sphere is in the possession of the arch-mage's grandson, who is obsessed with the memories, blurring the line in his head between himself and his grandfather.
