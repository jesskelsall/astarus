# Soulier Cottage Memory Sphere

## Summary

The Soulier Cottage Memory Sphere is a [memory sphere](memory-sphere.md) containing a tender family moment as Rene Soulier returns to his idyllic family cottage.

## Memories

Rene Soulier returns home to his family cottage on the hill overlooking a lake near the city of Chausain. He is greeted warmly by his wife [Corinne Soulier](../../characters/corinne-soulier.md) who is not expecting him home that evening. His daughter [Naeva Soulier](../../characters/naeva-soulier.md) sits at the kitchen table learning to write.

Rene finishes making shepherd's pie for dinner before the family sit at the table together, sharing a tender and typical family moment together.

## History

The sphere has been passed down through the Soulier family for generations, finding its way into the hands of [Raine Soulier](../../characters/raine-soulier.md). Raine spends a large amount of his waking hours inside of the sphere, to the point where he confuses himself with Rene.
