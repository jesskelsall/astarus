# Requiem for Chausain Memory Sphere

## Summary

A famous Chausinese musician created a piano piece to express their mournful and awesome feelings of the fall of Chausain and the ensuing Second Coming. This was captured on this [memory sphere](memory-sphere.md) in [Arrepont](../../places/cities/arrepont.md) within decades of the elves' arrival.

The musician would later die of distress, not able to settle on [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md).

Eventually the [memory sphere](memory-sphere.md) is rediscovered. Its music is studied, a piano recital arranged in [Valburg](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) to unveil the musician's final piece. It is well attended by elves from all over [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md), notably the [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).

After the performance backroom meetings take place between wealthy figures including Lady Grey who bid for the sphere, the current owner wishing to sell it for a ridiculous sum. Many parties are interested, including the [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).
