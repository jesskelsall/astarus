## Summary

The Dulsenn Graveyard Memory Sphere is a [memory sphere](memory-sphere.md) that contains a record of the [Copper Eye](../../organisations/copper-eye.md)'s venture into the [Dulsenn Graveyard](../../places/structures/dulsenn-graveyard.md)'s crypt in search of magical items.

## Memories

It depicts [Petjor Yordua](../../characters/petjor-yordua.md) meeting [Jonala Shirent](../../characters/jonala-shirent.md) outside of the [Dulsenn Graveyard](../../places/structures/dulsenn-graveyard.md) mausoleum with the key to open it, both proceeding inside with two [Copper Eye](../../organisations/copper-eye.md) guards. Inside they encounter skeletons and the ghost of [Vivien Bouxelles](../../characters/vivien-bouxelles.md), the original owner of [Unevaire](../weapons/unevaire.md).

Ultimately the pair triumph, leaving with [Unevaire](../weapons/unevaire.md), a [Staff of Adornment](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/staff-of-adornment), and a set of [Glamoured Studded Leather](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/glamoured-studded-leather).

## History

The [memory sphere](memory-sphere.md) was created by an unknown elf of Chausain who created a recording from the treeline. This was later examined by the Chausain authorities and used as proof of a plot against the Elves of Chausain, leading to the conviction of those depicted in the [memory sphere](memory-sphere.md). Despite this, their efforts to bring the found magical items to Chausain was successful.

The sphere made its way to [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md) during the Fall of Chausain.

Much later, the sphere ended up in the hands of a private collector in the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md). They brought it to [Raine Soulier](../../characters/raine-soulier.md) who arranged for its contents to be explored as part of their appraisal process.
