> A compendium of books detailing the humanoid races in great detail.

## Summary

A rather dry compendium of knowledge about humanoids. Due to their age, much of the societal constructs regarding race now appear dated and socially unacceptable by today's standards.

## Volumes

### Vol. 1: Defining Humanoids

Conjecture on what constitutes a humanoid and where the line is drawn. Makes a specific example of elves - how they are humanoids but are dissimilar to humans in many respects. Very scientific.

### Vol. 2: Humans

### Vol. 3: Elves

### Vol. 4: Lesser Common Races

- Gnomes
- Halflings

### Vol. 5: Exceptional Races

- Firbolgs
- Tieflings
- Aarakocra

Lots of second or third hand knowledge written down from oral sources, i.e. rumours of a rare humanoid presented as anecdotal evidence, written down without fact or conclusion, with the goal being to record at least something.

Includes the story of [Simanelli Tyrol](../../characters/simanelli-tyrol.md), a humanoid with pale blue water skin. He had an affinity for all things water, becoming a renowned ship captain in the early days of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). He set sail across the [Sea of Songs](../../places/seas/sea-of-songs.md) and was never seen again. The author wonders whether his racial disposition sealed his fate, or whether his watery skin was merely a coincidence.
