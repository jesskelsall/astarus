## Description

> A dark grey sphere that was found in the center of a crater, likely accompanied by strange creatures.
>
> It is 1ft in diameter and seemingly perfectly spherical with few surface imperfections. Three 2 in long erratic looking cracks in one area meet to form a hole in the orb, where pieces of its surface have broken off. Most of these pieces were found inside the orb along with a dark grey [meteoric dust](meteoric-dust.md) substance. The inside surface of the orb looks rough and haphazard.

## Summary

Meteorites are the delivery method used to bring [the meteorics](../../lineages/the-meteorics.md) to [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md) from the plane that [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md) and [Kaldoon](../../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) operate from.

## Properties

Like [the meteorics](../../lineages/the-meteorics.md) themselves, meteorites are made of [meteoric dust](meteoric-dust.md). This dust is hardened into a perfect sphere that is solid during transit through the sky and its impact with the ground.

After impact, [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md)'s enchantment magic allows the meteorite to transform its interior into meteorics, which then emerge from its outer "shell", leaving a hollow inside behind.

Meteorites are sentient creatures in their own right. Though they cannot move, they have two abilities:

- Creation of meteorics inside its center, allowing it to create the types of meteorics that are needed for the circumstances.
- Ability to glow either white or purple, to provide light or warn of danger.

Those that touch a "living" meteorite absorb its magical energy, afflicting them with [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md). This act leaves the meteorite without magical energy, rendering it inert. Unlike [the meteorics](../../lineages/the-meteorics.md), an inert meteorite retains its hardened spherical shape, rather than collapsing into a pile of dust.

With some effort, meteorites can be broken down into [meteoric dust](meteoric-dust.md).

## Travel

Meteorites fall to [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md) in the same fashion as a regular meteor would. Its trail is white or purple, depending on the aggression poured into its creation (purple is more aggressive).

Meteorites typically fall to the ground during the night, when they are least likely to be seen. Their impact site is carefully chosen by [Kaldoon](../../gods/deities/kaldoon.md), targeting the edge of small settlements where the emergent meteorics can best analyse their surroundings with minimal risk to being discovered.
