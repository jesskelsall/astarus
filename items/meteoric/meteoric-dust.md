## Description

> A dark grey fine gravel / powder of meteoric origin.

## Summary

Meteoric dust is the dark grey powdered substance that [the Meteorics](../../lineages/the-meteorics.md) are made from. It is magically bound to form construct / beast creatures that have senses and critical thinking.

Without its magic, meteoric dust becomes an inert substance, useless to all except those afflicted with [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md).

## Properties

On its own, meteoric dust is merely a building material. Created by [Kaldoon](../../gods/deities/kaldoon.md), it was made to be both pliable and resilient to attacks, giving [the meteorics](../../lineages/the-meteorics.md) made from it resistance to physical damage types.

Infused with potent enchantment magic by [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md), the meteoric dust becomes sentient, with locomotion, senses, and critical thinking. Upon the death of a meteoric, this magic dissipates, returning the creature to its base meteoric dust. That dust retains no magic or memory of its previous form.

Meteorics can absorb organic matter to create more meteoric dust, effectively giving them the means to grow or repair damage.

## Ingestion

*See: [Meteoric Dust Effect](meteoric-dust-effect.md)*

Those afflicted with [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md) can gain benefits from ingesting meteoric dust, unlocking or enhancing the abilities it provides, at the cost of also enhancing the affliction's negative effects.
