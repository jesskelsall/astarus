TODO

Landed ~4mo before [sanctuary](../../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

[Astral Squad](../../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) contracted TODO Adventurer Party to investigate Silethwaite for them. They returned with reports of creatures killing livestock and a description of their den.

In reality one of the adventurers kept the [meteorite](../meteorite.md) for himself. Over time his [Meteoridis](../../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md) has worsened. When the party find the group in [Northhaven](../../../places/cities/northhaven.md) he succumbs to his [Meteoridis](../../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md), transforming into a creature that attacks them.
