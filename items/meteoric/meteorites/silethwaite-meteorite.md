## Summary

The Silethwaite Meteorite was the second [meteorite](../meteorite.md) that [Astral squad](../../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) became aware of. It landed near the village of Silethwaite. Although the [meteorite](../meteorite.md) hasn't been found, there are stories of strange creatures attacking the locals, and a mysterious den in the forest.

## History

When [Astral squad](../../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) heard rumours of a meteor that landed near Silethwaite, they considered making a trip to the village to investigate. Not being able to make the journey due to their [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) commitments, they instead recruited a local [Northhaven](../../../places/cities/northhaven.md) adventuring group called [the Morning Chasers](../../../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) to look for them.

When [the Morning Chasers](../../../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) returned they spoke of strange creatures attacking the locals. Additionally the adventurers managed to locate a large animal den on the outskirts of the forest, though there were no signs of the creatures.

What [the Morning Chasers](../../../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) didn't tell [Astral squad](../../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) is that they'd found the meteor. [Slaine Alabaster](../../../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) picked it up, contracting [Meteoridis](../../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md) in the process. He kept it for himself, eventually experimenting with the [meteoric dust](../meteoric-dust.md) contained within and the [meteorite](../meteorite.md) itself.

Some months later, Slaine is deeply under the control of the [meteorite](../meteorite.md).
