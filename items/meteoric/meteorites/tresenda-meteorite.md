## Summary

The Tresenda Meteorite fell in [Upper Tresenda](../../../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/upper-tresenda.md), part of [Tresenda Pass](../../../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). It was the first [meteorite](../meteorite.md) that [Tyburn Dalvos](../../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) predicted with Divination.

## History

As [Tyburn Dalvos](../../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) began experimenting with divination magic as a means of looking out for new [meteorites](../meteorite.md), he saw a vision in his scrying pool of a [meteorite](../meteorite.md) crash landing in a valley between the mountains. Over the next few days he would repeat the vision, helping [Astral squad](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) to best approximate the landing site as [Tresenda Pass](../../../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md).

With [Tresenda Pass](../../../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) being quite far away from the squad's missions, they have not had a chance to investigate.
