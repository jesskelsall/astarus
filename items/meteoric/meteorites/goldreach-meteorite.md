## Summary

The Goldreach Meteorite fell to the ground north west of [Goldreach](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), providing the catalyst for the start of the [Purple Rain](../../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) campaign.

## History

*See: [Finding the Goldreach Meteorite](../../../storylines/ended/finding-the-goldreach-meteorite.md)*

Prior to the meteor's landing, [Tyburn Dalvos](../../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) of [Astral Squad](../../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) predicted its arrival and landing area of [Goldreach](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md). [Elysia Vanderboss](../../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md), then [Astral Squad](../../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md)'s [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md), dispatched [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) to [Goldreach](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to attempt to retrieve it. He set off 3 days before it landed, arriving 2 days after it did.

Wrenn convinced the [Purple Rain](../../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party to help him locate it. They eventually found it in the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), fighting 2 of the 3 [Meteoric Watchers](../../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) it had produced, killing both.

[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) touched the [meteorite](../meteorite.md) during the battle, falling unconscious and contracting [Meteoridis](../../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md). Since then the [meteorite](../meteorite.md) has been in the party's possession, closely guarded by Saoirse.
