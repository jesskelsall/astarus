## Summary

The Humar Meteorite is the first known [meteorite](../meteorite.md) to land on [Astarus](../../../planes/astarus.md). The crater was found by [Astral squad](../../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) under the leadership of [Elysia Vanderboss](../../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md), sparking their curiosity into the phenomena.

## History

While out on an unrelated [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission on Humar Estuary, [Astral squad](../../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) came across a large crater in the marshes with water pooled at the bottom. On investigation they found shards of the [meteorite](../meteorite.md). Not knowing what the grey brittle substance was they returned to [Northhaven](../../../places/cities/northhaven.md) to conduct private research into what they had found.
