Landed ~1mo before [Sanctuary](../../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md)

This is the one Wrenn tried to get before [Goldreach](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md). He contracted [the crimson blades](../../../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) to get it for him. When he assumed they stole his money and ran, he left. They actually got it after great difficulty, [Stalker](../../../characters/stalker.md) contracting [Meteoridis](../../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md) in the process. Now pissed at him and wanting revenge.

From Wrenn:

## History

TODO MOVE TO [METEORITE](../meteorite.md) PAGE

### [Purple Rain](../../../campaigns/purple-rain.md) Prelude

#### The Carnmere Meteorite

Prior to the campaign, Wrenn travelled to Carnmere to search for the Carnmere Meteorite. Here, without the knowledge of the rest of [Astral Squad](../../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), he hired [The Crimson Blades](../../../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) to retrieve the [meteorite](../meteorite.md) for him, offering to pay them more substantially when they returned with it.

After not hearing from them for 3 days, Wrenn got cold feet and left Carnmere for [Northhaven](../../../places/cities/northhaven.md), believing that the mercenary group had simply pocketed his deposit and left. He returned to [Astral Squad](../../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) empty-handed.
