## Summary

The Carnmere Meteorite landed in the hills on the opposite side of the [River Carn](../../../places/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md), between Carnmere and Hartsgarth. It was found by [the Crimson Blades](../../../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) at the request of [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md).

## History

*See: [The Crimson Blades Capture Wrenn](../../../storylines/the-crimson-blades-capture-wrenn.md)*

Word reached [Astral squad](../../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) of strange disappearances in and around Carnmere. Desperate for any sort of lead that might result in a [meteorite](../meteorite.md) find, [Elysia Vanderboss](../../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) sent [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) to Carnmere to investigate.

There Wrenn, without the knowledge of Elysia, paid [the Crimson Blades](../../../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) to find the [meteorite](../meteorite.md) for him. Wrenn grew impatient as they worked, assuming they had taken his money and ran. Wrenn therefore returned to [Northhaven](../../../places/cities/northhaven.md) empty handed.

In reality [the Crimson Blades](../../../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) had found evidence pointing to a [meteorite](../meteorite.md) landing and were busy investigating. [Stalker](../../../characters/stalker.md) took an interest in the search and was present when the group found the [meteorite](../meteorite.md) deep in the hills east of Carnmere. They killed five [Meteoric Watchers](../../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) for it. [Stalker](../../../characters/stalker.md) laid claim to the [meteorite](../meteorite.md), contracting [Meteoridis](../../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md) when he touched it.

With their client nowhere to be seen, [Stalker](../../../characters/stalker.md) wasn't happy to lose out on the second half of the pay from Wrenn. He sent [Morog Whiteknuckle](../../../characters/morog-whiteknuckle.md) after him to collect the debt.
