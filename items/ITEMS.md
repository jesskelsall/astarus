## Meteoric

### [Meteorite](meteoric/meteorite.md)

| []() | |
| --- | --- |
| **Name(s)** | [Meteorite](meteoric/meteorite.md)<br>Orb (unknown) |
| **Weight** | 2 lbs |
| **Notes** | Curiosity |

> A dark grey sphere that was found in the center of a crater, accompanied by strange creatures.
>
> It is 1ft in diameter and seemingly perfectly spherical with few surface imperfections. Three 2in long erratic looking cracks in one area meet to form a hole in the orb, where pieces of its surface have broken off. Most of these pieces were found inside the orb along with a dark grey sand-like substance. The inside surface of the orb looks rough and haphazard.

### [Meteoric Dust](meteoric/meteoric-dust.md)

| []() | |
| --- | --- |
| **Name(s)** | [Meteoric Dust](meteoric/meteoric-dust.md)<br>Grey Dust (unknown) |
| **Weight** | < 1 lbs |
| **Notes** | Substance |

> A dark grey sand-like substance. Its properties are unknown.

*From a dead Meteoric ([Thanea](../../astarus/people/thanea.md)):*
> This once gave form to a strange dark grey creature, but upon its death it collapsed into this substance in an instant.

*From inside a meteor ([Saoirse](../../astarus/people/saoirse.md)):*
> It was found inside the orb-like meteor and appears to be the same substance that the meteor itself is made of.

*Collected poorly ([Thanea](../../astarus/people/thanea.md)):*
> It is mixed with gravel and stone from the cave floor, making it hard to tell what is the grey dust and what is simply regular stone.
