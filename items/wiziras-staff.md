## Summary

Wizira's Staff was an arcane focus belonging to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). It had been in her possession since before the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) campaign characters first met.

Upon [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s death the staff was found by [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) on the shore of the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) [Meteorite](meteoric/meteorite.md) crater and taken as a memento of the party's friend and squad mate.
