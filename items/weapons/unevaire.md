## Summary

Unevaire is an elven sword originating in Chausain. It glows with the brightness of the full moon of Unevaire, the largest moon of [Oonar](../../planes/oonar.md) for which it was named.

Mechanically Unevaire is a [Moon-Touched Longsword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/moon-touched-sword-longsword).

## History

Unevaire was created using [echneshment](../../mechanics/magic/echneshment.md), drawing on a person's memories of the moon to empower the blade.

At some point the sword made its way into the hand of an elf of Chausain.

During the Battle of Chausain, the sword was in the possession of an elf that was taken by [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md) in the Second Coming.

Later the sword found its way into the hands of [Vulpes Geen](../../characters/vulpes-geen.md), who wielded it proudly while making an adventurer's name for himself.

Upon his death, the sword was bequeathed to his eldest son, [Vulpes Soon](../../characters/vulpes-soon.md).
