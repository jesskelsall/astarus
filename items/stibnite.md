# Stibnite

## Summary

Stibnite is a crystalline metallic mineral mined from deep underground by the dwarves of [Oonar](../celestial-objects/oonar.md). It is one of the rarest materials on [Oonar](../celestial-objects/oonar.md), commanding an incredibly high price.

The material was best known for its ability to prevent the passage of magical effects, much like lead, but while still allowing [echneshment](../mechanics/magic/echneshment.md) magic to pass through it.
