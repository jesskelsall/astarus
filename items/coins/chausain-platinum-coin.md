## Description

> A crescent shaped coin made of silvery platinum, stamped precisely on both sides. The design orients the coin so that the points of the crescent are facing upwards.

## Summary

Chausain platinum coins formed part of the currency of the Elves of Chausain civilisation. They are equivalent to modern platinum coins (pp) in terms of denomination and value, and may be recognisable to some, even without knowledge of Chausain and [Oonar](../../planes/oonar.md)'s history.

The shape of the coin is reminiscent of the Chausainese symbol for [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md), paying homage to the Judge Mother. As a result these coins are used in the Malneshi burial process for the wealthy and those who can afford it - a coin is placed over both eyes before the body is buried. The shape of the coin gives the exaggerated impression of closed eyes.
