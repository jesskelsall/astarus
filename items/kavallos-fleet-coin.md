## Summary

Kavallos Fleet coins are military commendations given to [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers who have achieved great deeds in the service of the fleet.

Coins are presented to their recipient in a military ceremony, much like real-world medals. The recipients then keep their coin on them as much as possible, often in a pocket or leather buttoned up case. They are rarely kept in plain sight; wearing one visibly is seen as disrespectful and showing off.

Coin recipients can use their coin to access veteran-only establishments or to receive discounts on anything from armaments to supplies to inn stays.
