## Arriving at the Arena

Later on the evening of the first day of [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md), the party make their way from the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md) to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), where they prepare for their upcoming [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) match against [Mortar Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md).

Waiting for their fight to be called, the party decide to spend some time strategising before they emerge into the arena to catch the start of [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) vs [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md).

## Before the Match

With [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) not in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md), the [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) in charge of the announcements corner [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) while they're waiting to emerge into the arena. They nervously ask which of them is in charge. The party offers [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) up, which the attendant writes down. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is considered acting [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) for the rest of the tournament.

As [Mortar Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) meet [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) at the tunnel, [Reozin Ironhide](../characters/reozin-ironhide.md) runs some basic banter past [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). Both parties then emerge into the arena. They are introduced to the arena in the usual manner.

## [Mortar Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) vs [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)

*[Initiative order begins]*

At the start of the fight [Aisling Kavanagh](../characters/aisling-kavanagh.md) bolts across the arena, casting Radiant Sun Bolt at [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), almost knocking her unconscious immediately. Saoirse reacts by casting False Life on herself and hexing Aisling, impairing their Wisdom.

[Reozin Ironhide](../characters/reozin-ironhide.md) squares off against [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md), meeting her on the side of the arena for a brawl. [Diarmuid Kavanagh](../characters/diarmuid-kavanagh.md) casts Enlarge on Reozin, growing the minotaur, causing him to loom large over Torbra. Diarmuid takes cover behind the wall. Torbra responds in kind, growing similarly large with Giant's Might before lashing out with a halberd strike.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Summon Beast, summoning a land beast in front of [Yoroe Briskboots](../characters/yoroe-briskboots.md). It starts biting her. She runs away, invoking an attack of opportunity. As she flees she knocks an arrow infused with Ensnaring Strike, loosing it at the beast. A critical hit deals it heavy damage, but more importantly it becomes restrained by the magical vines.

Aisling continues her flurry of Radiant Sun Bolts, this time focused on [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) who has moved into cover behind the wall. This time Aisling's attacks largely miss, having little effect. Saoirse responds by casting Eldritch Blast at Aisling before hiding behind [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), still injured from the initial flurry.

Reozin rages, striking twice at Torbra but only hitting once. He is now at full strength and ready to lay into Torbra.

Thanea casts Magic Missile, sending projectiles curving towards both Diarmuid and Yoroe. Diarmuid keeps his concentration on Enlarge, while Yoroe looks heavily wounded from the strike. Diarmuid then rushes around the wall to try and catch someone by surprise. He spots [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Saoirse on the opposite side of the arena. Sensing an opportunity he casts Aganazzar's Scorcher towards the pair, sending a line of flames across the arena. Neither come out of it well: Saoirse is knocked unconscious, while [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) loses concentration on Summon Beast, causing her land beast to vanish.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) charges at Aisling, casting Primal Savagery to grow claws to attack with. A well placed strike knocks her unconscious.

Torbra doubles down with Reozin, taking a moment to regain her composure and use Second Wind. She follows it up with her Stone Rune, succeeding in incapacitating Reozin who can no longer move. Throughout the rest of the fight he tries to break free of the magic but is unable. With Reozin unable to react, Torbra charges at Diarmuid. She misses with her charging attack but uses Action Surge to try again, but Diarmuid casts Shield to deflect the hit.

Yoroe casts Hunters mark on Torbra before shooting her with an arrow which hits hard. Fortunately Torbra was already feeling fine and takes the wound in her stride.

Thanea emerges from around the wall and casts Scorching Ray at Yoroe and Diarmuid. She misses the former but hits the latter twice, causing Diarmuid to lose his concentration. With that, Reozin returns to his normal size.

Diarmuid, sensing the fight quickly turning against them, seeks an opening to hit multiple people at once with a spell. He runs around Torbra's legs, finding [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Thanea standing together. He hits them both with Burning Hands, hitting them both but not landing a decisive blow.

His last card played, Torbra swings her halberd around, catching Diarmuid with a critical hit. Lucky to not decapitate him on the spot, Torbra slices deep into the back of his neck, causing him to pass out on the spot.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) turns her attention to Yoroe, casting Ice Knife across the arena at her. The initial hit knocks her unconscious. When the knife explodes, the shards of ice tear into her unconscious body. The crowd is outraged, sensing a breach of the rules. An [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) runs in immediately, casting Spare the Dying on Yoroe before giving a thumbs up towards [Liabella Peacock](../characters/liabella-peacock.md) in the official's gallery. The match continues uninterrupted.

With only Reozin left standing, albeit unable to move, [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) turn their attention to him. Thanea hits him with Scorching Ray, dealing heavy blows but not enough to finish him off. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) bonks Reozin with her staff, hoping for a humorous final hit. When he still doesn't fall she casts Healing Word to revive Saoirse.

Finally, Torbra opts to pick Reozin up and throw him against the wall. Even in her larger form she digs deep into her strength, lifting him from the ground and throwing him against the side of the arena. The impact hits him just right, knocking him unconscious as he collapses to the ground.

With all of [Mortar Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) unconscious, [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) win the match.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## After the Match

Torbra shrinks back to her normal size, panting from exhaustion. Thanea gleefully celebrates their victory. Saoirse picks herself up, lamenting her lack of heavier armour. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) offers a helping hand getting [Reozin Ironhide](../characters/reozin-ironhide.md) back on his feet, checking him over for wounds. As he comes to, he is in pain but makes a point of congratulating [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) on a well deserved victory, calling them worthy adversaries.

Both squads bow to the audience before leaving the arena. [Aisling Kavanagh](../characters/aisling-kavanagh.md) respectfully congratulates the group, telling them that [Mortar Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) will be rooting for them in their next match. [Mortar Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) invite [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) out for drinks.

## Post Match Drinks

Grabbing a table in [Geor's Door](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/geors-door.md) after watching the last of the day's matches, both squads enjoy a few rounds of drinks and some light conversation.

## Saoirse Goes Shopping

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) leaves the tavern looking for somewhere to buy some better armour. She manages to find an armoursmith in a five storey indoor shopping building. The shopkeeper examines her leather armour and recommends an upgrade to studded leather for 45 gp. She wants an even greater step up from there, but he explains that armour that's any heavier will feel very different to wear (she is not proficient).

She tries to haggle down the price by leaning on her reputation as a [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) match winner. The shopkeeper doesn't buy this, retorting that if she wins the tournament she'll have no problems affording new armour. She pays the offered price of 45 gp. She sells him her old leather armour for 6 gp.

When she inquires about buying a shield, the shopkeeper seems unconvinced that she knows how to wield one. He makes her hold it while striking her with a wooden sword, proving her lack of experience. He manages to convince her that wielding one in battle would be a bad idea.

## Déjà Vu for Thanea

Earlier when walking to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) from the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md), [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) had the feeling that she'd been on the same street before. After a few drinks she feels compelled to return to the spot and investigate further. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tags along.

Thanea starts to recognise the street from her most recent deva dream (Thanea Deva Dream 3). She is able to find the spot that she was stood when the dream began, though the night time warm and humid late summer's weather doesn't marry up with the dream's day time flakes of snow.

She gets spooked by the realisation, dashing out of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s sight into an alley, looking to get away from the place and from everyone. She finds herself in a tiny courtyard between buildings that has a statue at its center: a plinth with a panther representing [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) on it. She sits against it, slumping to the floor, before sobbing to herself. The feeling that another prophetic dream is afoot fills her with anguish, typically leading to bad events.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) eventually catches up with her, finding her crying and alone. When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks what's wrong, Thanea mumbles through a non-answer. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks if she wants company or help getting back to the stronghold. Thanea takes her offer of the latter. After a short period of being lost, a couple of [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) help the pair find their way back to the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md).

*[Long rest]*
