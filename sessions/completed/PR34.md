2 dice.

## Preparing to Move Out

In the early hours of the morning, [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) begin packing up to leave [Leithran Shack](../../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md) and continue their search for the crater caused by the [Humar Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md).

[Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md) packs his backpack and equips it before grabbing a smaller jury-rigged pack that he places on [Esme Leithran](../../characters/esme-leithran.md)'s back. They both leave the shack. Montel asks [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) what the plan is.

Torbra and [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) check the horizon for signs of where they are, figuring out the direction of east from the sunrise through the day's clear skies. Torbra suggests that the party should head south east.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) heads off to look for a forked stick that she can use as a divining rod. It takes her a little over an hour to find the right kind of stick. On her return she casts Locate Object, concentrating on her memory of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) watches what [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) is doing. While [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) can feel the magic of the spell activating, the stick does not move in her hands. She recognises that either there is no [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) out here or it is too far away.

Thanea and Torbra think on their location and situation, recalling a cross on [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md)' [Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../../maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md) in the centre of their current landmass. It dawns on them that the Humar Estuary and the surrounding land is massive, and so [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)'s strategy is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. The party continue to debate which direction to go. Torbra once again suggests heading south or south west.

## Scouting from High Above

Saoirse suggests that Thanea use Divine Soul to manifest her radiant wings before flying up high to get a better view. The sky is clear blue, suggesting that the view would be good. Thanea reluctantly agrees, worried about what altitude she can pull off, not having any idea of how long she can manifest her wings for - every time she has used Radiant Soul to date it has ended early, voluntary or otherwise.

Thanea's wings fade into existence, closed up on her back. As they become corporeal they exhibit a physicality that interacts with the material plane. She pushes off from the ground with them, flying high into the air to an altitude of about 120ft. As she goes the wind picks up as her perspective of the ground makes everything below look tiny. She briefly loses track of where the [Leithran Shack](../../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md) is. This combined with her altitude scares her for a moment but it doesn't put her off.

She takes a look over the land, seeing the [Carneid Inlet](../../places/seas-oceans/carneid-inlet.md) to her south and the [River Humar](../../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) to her east. She notes that the further south she looks, the more waterlogged the land looks. The opposite is true to the north as she observes some trees casting long shadows in the morning light. After taking the view in she quickly descends, not sure how much longer her wings will last. She glides down gently, floating back down to the shack's dock with her wings open. As she lands her wings fall limp, curved around to her front, before they disappear.

Montel is gobsmacked at the sight of Thanea doing this while Esme wears a look of extreme wonderment. Both are incredibly impressed by what Thanea can achieve.

Thanea relays what she saw to the party, as well as their rough location two thirds of the way down the peninsula. She suggests heading south west. Torbra defers to Thanea's judgement due to her unparalleled view.

## Exploring South West

The party decide on their marching order. [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) leads with [Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../../characters/esme-leithran.md) behind her. [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) takes a rear position.

During the journey Montel and Esme are in good spirits, Montel keeping Esme distracted with gentle conversation.

The land of the estuary continues to be boggy, the ratio of water to land increasing as they go. After three hours they reach the last section of solid ground before the estuary becomes the [Carneid Inlet](../../places/seas-oceans/carneid-inlet.md). There has been no sign of a crater.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) suggests she casts Locate Object again. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) questions what she is searching for. When [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) tells her that she was thinking of a [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), Saoirse suggests instead thinking of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) debate whether this would be specific enough to yield results. After a brief discussion the party agrees that it is worth a shot.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) casts the spell again, laying the forked stick in the flat crossed palms of her hands again, thinking of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) as seen in the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) and [the Dog's Groke](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md). It doesn't move initially but starts to faintly point in a direction, allowing her to follow it until it settles in a northerly direction.

Saoirse is excited to see the stick moving. She comes over to [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) to see it from close up but as she gets within a foot of [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), the stick turns toward her very suddenly, rolling out of [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)'s hands and onto the floor between the pair. A trace amount of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) still in Saoirse's clothing gets picked up by the spell. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) suggests it is because she likely still has dust on her but Saoirse denies it. She explains that it has also been a while since she ingested any of the dust.

[Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) decides to follow [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)'s stick, redirecting the party north.

## Saoirse Confides in Thanea

While walking north, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) catches [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) for a private conversation on the road, the pair pulling to one side while continuing.

Saoirse recalls their night in [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md) after the pair both woke up following Saoirse's deva dream. She admits to Thanea that she has wings of her own which first appeared that evening.  She describes them as being disgusting and without the ability for her to fly, which clearly bothers her. Saoirse admits that she wants wings like Thanea's and looks up to her.

She tells Thanea that she recently had a dream where she had similar radiant wings to Thanea. She puts herself down, calling herself a freak.

Thanea suggests that maybe she will get her own wings in time. Thanea tells her that she had many dreams of wings before she was able to manifest her own. She suggests that her dreams always come true and that she's never met or heard of anyone else like her before, despite her efforts to search.

Thanea asks what Saoirse can do with her wings. She is dismissive, telling Thanea that she doesn't know. She suggests they are worthless, comparing herself to Thanea unfavourably. Thanea empathises with Saoirse, hinting to her past as a [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) that was outcast by her family. Thanea suggests that the pair can experiment with Saoirse's wings to see what they do.

Saoirse focuses on Thanea's wings, expressing a want to accelerate any efforts to gain her own radiant wings, but without any idea how to do that. She has no desire to be "stuck like this" but feels hopeless. Thanea brings up Saoirse's friend ([Effie Silttooth](../../characters/effie-silttooth.md)) that Saoirse previously mentioned. Saoirse doesn't think that she is involved with her wings, and certainly isn't the source of her dreams. Saoirse says that she feels that Effie doesn't like her any more as it has been a while since they last spoke. Thanea speaks of never having had friends except her mentor.

Saoirse speculates that Effie (named) isn't actually her friend. Spending time with the rest of the party has given her perspective on this. Thanea isn't sure but points to similarities in their experiences.

*[Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> I can help you. I want to find out more about what I am as well.

## Travelling with a Child

[Esme Leithran](../../characters/esme-leithran.md) gets [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md)'s attention as the party proceeds north, asking inquisitively about her halberd, not sure what it is. Torbra tells her that it's a weapon like a knife. She remains intrigued by it.

*[Esme Leithran](../../characters/esme-leithran.md):*
> You must be really strong!

[Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md) asks Torbra how she ended up in the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). She recants her backstory of being an orphan in Iredale before heading through [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md), meeting the rest of the party and getting swept up in the search for the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). She explains that events took a dangerous turn that saw them fleeing from the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

When Torbra begins to explain who the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are, Montel stops her, knowing fine well who they are. Torbra completes her tale of their journey into the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) to date. He suggests that nobody in the travelling group wants to be here on the estuary.

After another hour of travel, Esme is seen letting go of Montel's hand, wanting off course before leaning over into some grass. Montel stops as she is taking a while, causing the party to assess their surroundings, finding nothing suspicious. After a few more moments Esme emerges with a 2ft long stick, muddy at one end. Montel asks what she has. She pants for a moment before brandishing it with a "yargh!".

As the party resumes their travel, Esme swishes the stick as if it was a sword, happily amused. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) casts Minor Illusion to create sound effects that match the timing of her swings. The first time this happens she goes slack jawed, looking at Montel in astonishment. She continues to swing periodically for the next hour while Saoirse plays different increasingly ridiculous noises until both the party and Esme are sick of the experience. Nonetheless she keeps hold of the stick.

## Camping on Solid Ground

By late afternoon the party have emerged onto more consistently solid ground, trees becoming a more common (but still sparse) sight. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) casts Locate Object again, seeing her forked stick turn just as readily, pointing them north-northwest - only a slight course correction.

The party agrees to proceed for another hour as the sky becomes orange and the sun begins to set. [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) evaluates the increasingly grassy landscape with more trees seen to the north. Camp is set up at the base of a large tree, tents and bedrolls set up. [Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md) lights a small oil lamp as a source of light.

[Esme Leithran](../../characters/esme-leithran.md) wanders the immediate vicinity while camp is being set up. She finds a rather large leaf, examining it for a moment before discarding it. After camp is set up she begins hitting her stick against the tree, using it again as a weapon. The noise catches the party off guard, so they begin looking for danger around them. Only [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) doesn't quickly realise what is happening.

Torbra joins Esme at the tree. She finds a nearby branch, taking a small carving knife to strip it of its smaller branches, creating a flimsy makeshift "sword". Esme sees what she is doing and points her own stick towards her. Torbra begins play fighting with her, meeting her stick with her own repeatedly.

Montel watches the pair from his seat on his bedroll, the rest of the party sitting within earshot as he begins to talk of his daughter.

*[Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> There's just something about her, isn't there?

Saoirse and Thanea aren't sure whether he is talking about Esme or Torbra at first. Montel looks at Thanea.

*[Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> I think after all of this she'll probably grow up wanting to be like you lot.

Thanea tells Montel that it isn't a job to aspire to, using their story as evidence. Montel learns that Thanea doesn't have children before telling her that young children are full of fleeting lofty aspirations that come and go each season, and that Esme has no concept of a job at her age. Saoirse points out that for all [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) is a job, they don't necessarily know what they're doing. Montel vocalises his empathy.

Conversation turns to [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and her firbolg lineage. Montel is humbled by her age and hermit forest upbringing. It dawns on Montel that the party is very new to their line of work which doesn't fill him with confidence, but he once again expresses his gratitude for their help with the crocodiles.

Montel calls Esme to bed. She immediately drops her stick, walking away from Torbra with zero acknowledgement, going straight to Montel. He takes her cloth wrap shoes off, getting the worst of the mud away from her sleeping bag. He goes into her backpack and retrieves a worn and mud encrusted teddy bear. From her sleeping position she reaches up for it, cuddling it close after he gives it to her. Esme falls asleep almost instantly.

Saoirse broaches the topic of safety again, suggesting that Montel and Esme keep their distance as the party travels. Montel gets panicked at the near suggestion that they not stick close together, worrying that the party will abandon them. [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) implores him not to be a hero in the face of any danger. Montel looks visibly disgusted at the notion, stammering an assertion that he is no fighter and will be running at the first sign of trouble without hesitation.

Thanea arranges with Montel that if [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) lose him and Esme, they can create some sort of magical signal to attract them back to the party. Saoirse suggests that [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) can cast Locate Object on one of their possessions to find them again. Montel takes [Vensys Leithran](../../characters/vensys-leithran.md)'s necklace out of his bag, showing its scratched plain silvery design with a teardrop shaped amber pendant. He tells [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) that it is always with him and is one of a kind. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) examines it for a moment before Montel puts it away.

Montel resolves to go to sleep, following Esme's lead. The party prepares for bed. Montel and Esme camp outside of the tents, letting the party have their own spaced in their tents.

## Saoirse Tries Her Wings

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) offers to take first watch. She sees nothing of note aside from birds and bats flying through the night.

She spends some time trying to activate Necrotic Shroud to summon her wings, struggling to get anywhere and doubting herself throughout the process. Eventually she feels a radiant warmth in her torso that travels to her back, becoming cold as it goes. As it reaches her shoulder blades, her sickly black silk-thin wings appear, hanging delicately in the air. She touches one, finding it slightly sticky, sending a shiver down her spine.

Saoirse decides to wake [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md), carefully waking her up without waking anyone else. Saoirse is leaning over her, black spectral wings hanging behind her. As Thanea wakes she sees them for herself, also seeing her completely white hair.

At first Thanea thinks that Saoirse has cast Disguise Self on herself, but Saoirse assures her that this is what she looks like with wings. Saoirse tells Thanea of her struggle to activate her wings and the radiant to necrotic sensation within her when it finally happened. Thanea relates to the radiant warmth, a matching experience to her sensations when activating Radiant Soul.

Thanea suggests that Saoirse is unable to complete the action correctly and perhaps there is hope for her dream of radiant wings. Saoirse is excited at the possibility of her dream to be like Thanea maybe being possible. Thanea talks of the first time she activated her wings being a moment of desperation in trying to protect her friends. She speculates that Saoirse may need a similar moment of her own.

Thanea goes back to bed. Saoirse wakes [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) for her watch. The rest of the night is quiet aside from a sighting of crocodiles in a nearby pool of water, though they present no immediate threat.

*[Long rest]*

## Arriving at the Crater

Another clear day dawns. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) casts Druidcraft to see that the rest of the day will be much the same.

As the party resumes their journey, [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) lifts [Esme Leithran](../../characters/esme-leithran.md) onto her shoulders. [Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md) hands Esme's stick up to her, prompting her to issue charge commands to Torbra as if she was a horse.

After only an hour of travel, the party arrive on the edge of a large lake-like body of water - the [Humar Meteorite crater](../../places/rivers-lakes/humar-meteorite-crater.md). It is 400ft in diameter, round, completely filled with water, and without a visible lip or shoreline at a glance. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) recognise that the lake doesn't fit in with the surrounding landscape, its edges cutting through the surrounding hilly undulations. Saoirse wonders out loud if the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) could have created a crater that filled up with water and became this lake.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) casts Detect Magic but finds nothing magical within 30ft, so she begins wading into the lake, her feet leaving the bottom after 5ft. The rest of the party sternly tell her to be careful as they don't know what's in the water but she continues on regardless. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) kicks up silt from the edge of the crater, muddying the nearby water. Saoirse watches the water very carefully but sees nothing dangerous.

[Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) investigates the edge of the lake. She finds that the lake starts very abruptly. The edge is uniform all the way around with no shore. The typical estuary reeds don't extend far into the water, indicating a steady increasing depth. Torbra realises that the lake looks like an impact crater, telling the party.

## Danger in the Depths

[Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) gets a bad feeling, readying her crossbow and casting Mage Armour on herself.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) continues swimming toward the centre of the crater, looking around as she goes. She takes a moment to look down, not able to see the bottom through the dark murky water. As she does she sees a large black shadow pass beneath her.

*[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md):*
> I think I found something. I also think I'm in danger.

As she says this a giant crocodile begins to surface, creating a rising dome of water around her before it breaches the surface tension, sending water splashing into the air and cascading across its head. It opens its mouth wide, most of her body passing inside of it.
