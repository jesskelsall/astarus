The party resumes their day of exploration, leaving [Nightcrest Farm](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/nightcrest-farm.md). It is now 14:00 and the marching order hasn't changed: [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md), [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)/[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md), [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md).

They head west towards the lake that [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) spotted from the tree.

## Wolves from the Forest

On their approach across the grassy plains, Torbra spots 2 wolves near the forest's edge to the south west, 2 miles away. They have noticed the party and begin heading in their direction - at first cautiously, but eventually running at full speed towards them with purpose.

- [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) closes her distance to them as they approach. She swings at them with her halberd indecisively.
- [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts Fireball several times, injuring the wolves.
- [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) uses Mold Earth to excavate a spot of dirt in front of her and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md), depositing it to the side. As the party advances into combat she abandons this idea and instead uses Wild Shape to become an equipment-wearing wolf, charging into battle. She arrives too late.
- [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) fires her crossbow while they are at range, injuring the wolves, before switching to Eldritch Blast which finishes off both wolves. The first is launched backwards and dies, the second is a critical hit which pierces the wolf's rib cage, spilling its guts from the exit wound across the grass.

Following this, the party resumes heading towards the lake.

## At [Ray Lake](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/ray-lake.md)

The party arrives at the edge of [Ray Lake](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/ray-lake.md). They find themselves on a stony beach, looking out across the lake. On the other side they can see the stream that feeds the lake, cascading over gentle waterfalls into the lake. To its right is a small settlement of wooden huts.

They notice a boat some distance away on the lake, containing two people who are fishing.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) finds some skimming stones on the beach and just about manages to skim some of them before pocketing two. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) lifts a large boulder using Mold Earth and throws it into the lake, creating a huge splash.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) shouts at the people in the boat, catching their attention. They wave before making their way to the shore, where they disembark.

Nelson Cadash does most of the talking. When the party asks about the meteor, he explains that their settlement believes it crash landed north of them, likely in the forest. One of their own, Jacob, decided to go and look for it, and hasn't returned since. Beltari Yoradoris is pessimistic and rude, deriding Jacob for going. After they finish speaking, the pair resume fishing on the lake.

The party decides to visit their settlement on the other side of the lake, following the northern shore counter-clockwise. Here they confirm with the locals what Nelson told them about their understanding of the meteor and the story of Jacob.

They speak with Jacob's parents who explain that after the meteor crash landed, he was keen to go and find it, but his father forbade it. He took off the following night anyway, taking gear and supplies with him. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) attempts to get one of Jacob's belongings from the family, claiming that her tracking animal could find him, but they see through her lie and ask the party to leave.

## Towards [Hurley Farm](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hurley-farm.md)

The party resumes their exploration, starting to the north of the settlement, on a corner of the forest that sticks out. Here Torbra finds footprints, but is unable to find anything noteworthy about them, assuming that the people in the settlement travel this trail on their way in and out.

Unsure what to do next, they head towards the farm building that [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) saw while in the tree at [Nightcrest Farm](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/nightcrest-farm.md). This takes them north east across the plains and away from the forest.

After a while the party spots three people walking north west, crossing their path some distance in front of them. They appear to be adventurers based on what they are wearing and the weapons they are carrying. The party decides to leave them be and continues on.

## At [Hurley Farm](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hurley-farm.md)

The party arrives at [Hurley Farm](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hurley-farm.md) towards late afternoon. They can see the long barn and its conjoined farmhouse on the left side towards the back. Janus can be seen at the end of the barn tending to his pigs with Patch, his sheepdog.

Patch begins barking and runs over the group. He continues to bark, only stopping momentarily when [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) pets him. Janus follows soon after, sick of Patch's incessant barking, and apologising profusely. He is a timid man and his manner of speaking reflects it.

When asked about the meteor, Janus explains that he was already awake that night due to Patch barking at a wolf. He believes it came down to the north west, and it sounded close. He believes he may have seen the orange glow of fire but is unsure as he was tired.

While speaking, Janus alludes to it just being him and Patch here now, and that he got Patch as an early warning system for danger. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) correctly reads him, believing that his wife died.

The party asks if they can stay the night. Janus is caught off guard by the request but hesitantly agrees, letting them stay in the barn with the pigs providing they round the pigs back up into the barn and close it up behind them. They agree. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) gives Janus 3 sp unprompted for the trouble.

Everyone except [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) helps round up the pigs with the help of Patch. Janus goes back into the farmhouse while they do so. Patch is a natural herder, so at one point he comes over to [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and barks at her for not helping, before returning to the task at hand.

With all of the pigs in the barn, Patch returns to the farmhouse for the night. Everyone gets comfortable - [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) using a big grain sack as a bean bag seat, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) sleeping against one of the pigs. The party falls asleep for the night.
