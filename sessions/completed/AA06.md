## Mission Debrief

[Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) leaves [Bryce Morton's Office](../../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md) with 80 gp, the full [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) payout for [Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)'s first mission, [Check Logging in Arnaside](../../storylines/ended/check-logging-in-arnaside.md). She reconvenes with the rest of the party, wishing to sit down and chat about how the mission went.

They make their way to [the Rose Buckler](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md), grabbing a table. Ahsha passes out 20 gp to each party member, fairly splitting the mission's payment. She then asks to talk about what everyone is capable of in combat, wishing to improve the team's cohesion.

| Character | Self Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | Good at punching and chopping. Can recover from some wounds. |
| [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | Shows her star map. Explains Starry Form constellations. Doesn't have the best control over it. |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | Good at making noises and touching people for healing. |
| [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | Doesn't make much noise, favours a crossbow. Good at finding weak points and cutting from up close. |

## Downtime in [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md)

Ahsha tells the party that they have 4 days off as they completed their mission early.

| Character | Downtime Comfort | Total Price |
| --- | --- | ---:|
| [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | Comfortable | 5 gp 2 sp |
| [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | Poor | 4 sp |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | Squalid | 4 sp |
| [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | Squalid | 4 sp |

## [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md): Posting Pastry

[Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) looks for a bakery in the [Sunset District](../../places/districts/sunset-district.md). She finds one, purchasing a dense fruitcake for 2 sp. She takes it back to her room, waiting for a moment where she is alone. Once she is she cuts a hole in the bottom, hollows out a compartment, places 15 gp in it, and casts Mending to repair the cut.

Ephaine looks for somewhere to post the fruitcake from. Initially struggling to find somewhere or someone willing to help her, she wanders into [Sunset Delivery Astor Square](../../places/buildings/shops/sunset-delivery-astor-square.md). She asks to post the fruitcake to her family, the postal worker asking where they are. She tells him they're in Filisur. He offers to post it for 8 gp, to which Ephaine tries to convince him to lower his price, to no avail. With that she decides to come back later.

Eventually she meets up with [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) who gives her 3 gp to send the package back home. Ephaine tells Ahsha what she's sending and to whom, but not what it contains. She returns to the post office, paying the 8 gp to have the package sent, her told that it would take about a week to arrive.

> Filisur

## [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md): Gambling on Potions

At some point during her downtime, Redwyn wanders through [Astor Square](../../places/structures/astor-square.md), coming across [Gwinthel's Potion Tombola](../../mechanics/roleplay/games/gwinthels-potion-tombola.md). She watches as two parents hand a child the coin to play, before they win a Healing Potion. This draws the attention of Redwyn who decides to play, despite suspecting that the entire game is rigged.

| Character | Number | Prize |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| Child | 15 | Healing Potion |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | 56 | *None* |

Upon realising that she hasn't won, Redwyn swears, trying to cause a commotion. [Gwinthel Greenhand](../../characters/gwinthel-greenhand.md) defends the game, explaining how expensive these potions are. Redwyn storms off, lowering the mood of the crowd surrounding the game.

## [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md): Pit Fighting

Ahsha is desperate to let off some steam with a pit fight. She has heard from [Tydrus Tinshield](../../characters/tydrus-tinshield.md) that there is a secret pit fighting ring at [the Rat's Nest](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rats-nest.md) in the [sunrise district](../../places/districts/sunrise-district.md). With [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) in tow, the three make their way there.

On arrival, Ahsha heads over to the bar, striking up conversation with [Rufus Glintock](../../characters/rufus-glintock.md), being quite forward about her intent to pit fight. Rufus chooses not to acknowledge this, serving Ahsha her drink. When she tries again, Rufus leans in and tells her that "the walls have eyes". Ahsha and Redwyn notice the [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) watching them from a table half way down the tavern. Ahsha holds a drink aloft in acknowledgement, not fearing their presence.

*[Rufus Glintock](../../characters/rufus-glintock.md):*
> Look, just have another drink, go to the toilet, then get out of here.

Ahsha is unhappy with the response. Redwyn steps in to help, bribing Rufus 1 gp to tell her where she can play games. He tells her there is likely someone in the back playing [Twenties](../../mechanics/roleplay/games/twenties.md) before leaning in and repeating his above line, trying to be less subtle about the coded message.

Ahsha gets the message, heading to the toilet. She finds a gap between the wooden slats of the wall and the dirt floor. When she pushes on it it flexes, revealing a laddered hole in the ground, heading deeper. She goes down. It leads to a single dark corridor. Feeling her way along it she comes to a doorway.

Heading inside she is greeted with a secret pit fighting tavern, complete with a ring. She feels many eyes on her, judging the new competition that just entered. Redwyn and Ephaine soon enter, following Ahsha's lead. Ephaine is nervous being in such a hostile and unknown environment.

Ahsha heads over to the bar, making small talk with [Vorrick Pumpitibeg](../../characters/vorrick-pumpitibeg.md). He makes her buy a drink for 1 sp, giving her a strong ale without asking. It becomes clear that you need to drink before participating. Vorrick goes on to explain that if Ahsha wants to fight, she need only go up to someone and challenge them - everyone in this tavern is here to fight.

Ahsha spots [Travis Derk](../../characters/travis-derk.md) who cracks his knuckles when he notices her looking. Ephaine speaks up about the sight of [Allynna Oriphine](../../characters/allynna-oriphine.md), an elf, leaning up against the wall, alarm bells going off in her head. Ahsha asks Vorrick about Travis. He explains that he is known as "The Bridge" and is probably the strongest fighter in the room, hinting that she'd be a fool to fight him.

Not one to shy away from a challenge, [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) challenges [Travis Derk](../../characters/travis-derk.md) to a pit fight. This rouses the bar which begins to cheer quietly, anticipating the bout. Redwyn cases the room, finding a patron to bet against, wagering 7 gp on Ahsha. The patron is confident that they'll win the bet. Travis removes his belt and throws it on the floor.

*[Travis Derk](../../characters/travis-derk.md):*
> Your funeral.

*[Initiative order begins]*

As both Ahsha and Travis are fighters, and the rules forbidding weapons and magic, the fight quickly devolves into a straight punching match. The pair exchange blows back and forth.

Ahsha eventually tries to grapple Travis, succeeding. She squirms with him in her grip, getting extra hits in while attempting to throw him to the floor, collapsing him to the ground. All the while Travis is punching her back, enjoying the grappled fight.

Travis throws Ahsha off of her, pushing through to hit her as he goes. Once again the match turns into a punching match, with both competitors taking moments to regain some of their strength. One of Ahsha's punches knocks one of his teeth clean out, flicking blood across the floor. With his strength waning, his hits fail to connect while Ahsha lands her finishing blows, grabbing him and slamming him to the ground.

*[Initiative order ends]*

The room is silent as Ahsha wins. A few quiet cheers can be heard as people win their bets. [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) pockets 7 gp in profit from her bet with a random patron. [Vorrick Pumpitibeg](../../characters/vorrick-pumpitibeg.md) casts a spell to heal Travis, who regains consciousness as his entourage drag him out of the arena and seat him back at his table.

Ahsha celebrates by buying 2 ales for 2 sp and taking one over to Travis. The pair share a respectful moment in which Ahsha "the Basha" drops her pit fighting nickname and Travis comments that it appears she has done this before. Ahsha shares that she was a pit fighter in her youth, though is a little out of practice.

Reuniting with Ephaine and Redwyn, Ephaine expresses concern for Ahsha's health, speaking a healing word to help her out. As the group are leaving, Ahsha flicks Travis' missing tooth to him, triggering a scowl followed by a knowing grin.

## [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md): Shopping

Whisper spends their downtime doing some shopping. They head back to [Rhotrukk Wepons](../../places/buildings/shops/rhotrukk-wepons.md) to buy a new blade, easily able to find what they're looking for.

| Item | Price |
| --- | ---:|
| Ration (day) x4 | 2 gp |
| Scimitar | 25 gp |

## A Tournament Invite

Four days of downtime come to an end.

*[Long rest]*

[Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) reconvene before heading to [Bryce Morton's office](../../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md). [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md) is once again sat in his chair, greeting the squad. He tells them that it's time for their second mission, but first they have a letter. He hands them the invite to [Nature's Battle 28](../../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md) ([AA06-L-1](../../letters/AA06-L-1.md)). Ephaine accepts the letter, seeing that is stamped with an [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) seal in grey wax. When she is hesitant to open it now, Bryce encourages her, hinting that its contents are good news. Ephaine reads the letter to the party.

Ephaine is taken aback by the honour of being picked for [Nature's Battle 28](../../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md). Bryce echoes this sentiment, reminiscing about taking part in the tournament earlier in his career. He explains that should they choose to participate, their missions will be moved to accommodate this, so the choice exists in a vacuum. Bryce goes on to hint that their next mission isn't time sensitive, meaning they could make some progress before the tournament before finishing it off afterwards.

Ephaine asks Bryce for his blessing to compete. Bryce makes it clear that [Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md)'s blessing trumps any permission he could give. He explains that [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) has also hand picked the squads, so everything is on the level. Ahsha asks if it would be okay to pick Bryce's brains on what the tournament is like, which he is more than happy to do, relishing at the opportunity to reminisce about his youth. He hints that the format of the tournament has changed somewhat since he competed, and it's been a few years since he's been able to attend.

Bryce gives some context on the significance of the tournament, [Vorrinel's Stand](../../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) & its contract to the space-deprived [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md), and the new arena being built in the new city of [Yeatscale](../../places/cities/yeatscale.md). On hearing Bryce talking about the tournament as an opportunity for the general populace to see [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) and what they can do in a positive context, Ephaine mutters under her breath about being akin to circus freaks, a comment that Bryce hears but chooses not to acknowledge. Bryce continues explaining what the [Blade's Rest](../../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival is.

Ahsha asks for more details about the format of the fight. Bryce explains the squad versus squad format. When she asks about the tournament's relationship with death, Bryce divulges the full-on combat nature of the fights, though the intent is for everyone to walk away alive. He makes it clear that people have died in the arena before, though it is an increasingly rare occurrence.

The party ask about the other squads competing. Bryce is proud that both [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) are competing, a rare honour for an [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md). Typically the squads are from a mixture of divisions of the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), so two from the same division and city is rare.

Ephaine hopes that she won't accidentally kill anyone, something she vocalises in front of Bryce. When he nonchalantly asks if that's likely to be an issue, it becomes clear to her that Ahsha didn't include the incident with ripping a kobold in half in her mission report. Of her own volition Ephaine goes on to detail what happened to Bryce, apologising for her behaviour. He agrees to keep it a secret, advising her to avoid killing anyone during the tournament.

The party considers whether to compete. Everyone is either intrigued or excited by the opportunity, especially as it could be a chance to put one over on [Ruby squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md).

## A Mission Brief

The conversation turns to the matter of [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)'s next mission. [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md) makes it clear that [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) will be leading the mission as he feels the mission will suit their skills.

He explains that the Major of Urban Expansion has an operation in [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md) with two [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads stationed there, keeping an eye on the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) who are trying to expand the village into a town. Tensions have been heated recently, so Bryce has been asked to send one of his squads to conduct an impartial review of what's going on.

Ephaine asks for more details of what the tensions are being caused by. Bryce knows little, instead suggesting speaking to [Kasston Tosslefront](../../characters/kasston-tosslefront.md), though he has heard that the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) intend to build on the other side of the river, which is likely a problem for the wildlife.

When Ephaine asks if [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) has the authority to act on what they learn, Bryce cautions against acting, painting the mission as purely an investigation. He immediately contradicts himself by telling Whisper that they have the final say while in the field.

Bryce makes it clear that the mission report must contain information about *both* the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

| Character | Rank | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Kasston Tosslefront](../../characters/kasston-tosslefront.md) | [Astorrel Major](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-major.md) | Urban Expansion |
| [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) | [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) | Urban Expansion / [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md) / [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) |
| [Trynelle Mildrabbit](../../characters/trynelle-mildrabbit.md) | [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) | [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md) Expansion / [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md) / [Spoor Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/spoor-squad.md) |
| [Runnis Marblemane](../../characters/runnis-marblemane.md) | [Astornox Lieutenant](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md) | Settlements / Villages |

[Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md) also makes a point of congratulating [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) on her mission report for [Check Logging in Arnaside](../../storylines/ended/check-logging-in-arnaside.md), noting that it was passed on to [Kleachanshtojak Yrlyassa](../../characters/kleachanshtojak-yrlyassa.md), the [Astorrel Major](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-major.md) of Dragons, who found it most interesting.

With the mission presented, Bryce asks the squad if they intend to take part in the tournament, so that he can schedule their mission around that. They make it clear that their intent is to compete.

## Crossing Paths with [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md)

While exiting [Auric Rise](../../places/buildings/auric-rise.md), [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) catches a glimpse of [Darius Dunn](../../characters/darius-dunn.md) walking into [the Mission's End](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-missions-end.md). She decides to follow him inside, paying 1 gp 2 sp to gain access to the building just to speak with him.

She finds [Ruby squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) sat at one of the benches, getting ready to grab some food. [Penance Zahiri](../../characters/penance-zahiri.md) excitedly waves her over in their usual chipper manner. The squad regales tales of their first mission to Hartsgarth to investigate the presence of bears there, bragging about having killed a few that they found in a den near the village.

Penance, sensing the vibes Redwyn is giving off, insists that theirself, [Morgan Caithness](../../characters/morgan-caithness.md), and [Tabari Se](../../characters/tabari-se.md) get up to grab food, leaving Redwyn and Darius alone. She asks him some personal details, going so far as to inquire about why he joined the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). He explains that his red skin made him an outcast. The two connect for a moment, Redwyn making him feel valid. Suddenly she makes her move, climbing onto the table and grabbing him for a kiss. He resists slightly but lingers in the moment, before realising what is happening. Immediately after he stands, running towards the stairs in complete embarrassment. He hovers for a moment, not knowing where to go, before joining the rest of [Ruby squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) in line at the canteen.

Penance can be seen slapping Darius playfully on his side, seemingly encouraging him. Redwyn sees Darius looking overwhelmed by a public display of affection, unsure of how to handle the situation.

## Accepting the Tournament Invite

The party looks for a way to reply to the letter ([AA06-L-1](../../letters/AA06-L-1.md)). They find their way to [Astpost Northhaven](../../places/buildings/shops/astpost-northhaven.md), where they are greeted by a postal worker who initially doesn't believe [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) has business sending a letter to an [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) General. Upon producing the letter, his doubt is assuaged, and he lets her send the letter to Liabella for 2 cp.

## More Tension at the Stronghold

Making their way back to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), the party once again notices a heightened [Astorrel guard](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) presence in and around the gatehouse. While looking around, Ephaine notices [Kur Merkys](../../characters/kur-merkys.md) lying down on a nearby rooftop of a 2 storey building. She wastes no time casting Misty Step to teleport right next to him.

This catches Kur off guard, who jumps to his feet, drawing both of his daggers. Ephaine calmly asks him what he's doing up here, preventing him from attacking. He isn't willing to divulge details, merely barking at Ephaine to go away.

Ephaine figures that Kur is here for the people currently in [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in the stronghold. She threatens to tell the [Astorrel guards](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) of his presence. He tells her that he's allowed to be here, producing an [Astorrel Lieutenant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-lieutenant.md)'s badge, declaring himself a [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter, divulging that one of the four people in [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) killed his friend ([Vilnia Kovas](../../characters/vilnia-kovas.md)). Ephaine isn't impressed, but realising that he's not going to budge, opts to Misty Step back to street level. Once there she fills the rest of the party in on the encounter.

Heading back into the stronghold, Ephaine speaks to the [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) on duty, telling him about Kur on the rooftop. He's aware of the [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter's presence, confident that he won't get any closer.
