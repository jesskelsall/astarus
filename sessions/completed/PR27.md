## Saoirse Runs Off

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), after running out of the [Vorrinel's Stand](../../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) arena following the end of the [Nature's Battle 27](../../storylines/ended/natures-battle-27.md) final match, runs through the streets of [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md). She looks for a spot where she can be alone and away from the stimulus of the busy festival atmosphere, the effects of the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) messing with her perception of the world around her.

She eventually finds a small back street with T-junctions at either end. She slumps down against the wall in the middle of the street, hyper aware of the potential for people to come near to her. She spends half an hour sat here trying to ignore what is going on around her, getting surprised as random passers by traverse the street but ultimately leave her alone.

## An [Aasimar](../../lineages/aasimar.md) Encounter

After a while she hears the hushed intent voices of [Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) and [Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md) who are attempting to flee the vicinity:

*[Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> We need to get out of here, quickly!

*[Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md):*
> Of course mistress.

They start moving down the street in Saoirse's direction. Despite her vision not working properly she makes out Allisa's copper armour pieces and full faced helm, as well as Xavier's hood and leather armour.

The pair begin to jog down the street before Allisa catches a view of Saoirse and feels her [Aasimar](../../lineages/aasimar.md) presence. She stops and moves over to Saoirse to take a closer look.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Wait, this isn't right. I feel it in her too. There are more?

*[Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md):*
> We don't have time for this, let's go!

*[Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Ah, fuck!

Allisa reaches out towards Saoirse's chin, who catches her hand by the wrist.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Please, let me help you.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Why would I need your help?

Allisa hesitates for a moment while she thinks, her arm still in Saoirse's grip.

*[Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md):*
> Come on, they're going to find us!

*[Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Okay Xavier, let's do this! 

She quickly pulls her arm away from Saoirse and out of her grip before leaning in:

*[Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I won't forget about you, child.

Allisa runs off down the street to follow Xavier. The pair disappear around a corner and into the night.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Well thanks for nothing, I thought you were going to help me!

## The After Party

At the [Nature's Battle 27](../../storylines/ended/natures-battle-27.md) after-party the rest of the party mingle with the military higher-ups. [Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md) converses with the party, complimenting them on their efforts, revealing that she had a bet on [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md).

She speaks with [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) about her Radiant Soul wings, complimenting her on her unusual ability. [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is annoyed to not receive similar recognition for her Giant's Might ability, to which Liabella is quick to save face and throw her a compliment.

Liabella asks where the party's fourth is, but they don't know. Liabella enjoys some further small talk, clearly having fun talking outside of her usual politically charged circles. She excuses herself to talk to another group.

[Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) then comes over to talk to the party. They are sad to have lost the bet they made on [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) too, but takes it in good spirit, congratulating the party on their efforts. They apologise for "talking shop", informing them that when they arrive back in [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) in the morning, [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) expects them to report to [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) within the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) so they can be given their first mission. They encourage the party to do their best and not let them down.

## Finding Saoirse

The party choose to leave the after-party and look for [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md). [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) finds her first, finding her slumped in a quiet street, sobbing to herself.

Saoirse is surprised by [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)'s presence, casting Meteoric Blast at her but missing spectacularly, the blast of force breaking a window across the street and provoking distant dog barking. [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) hear the commotion and quickly find her too.

When Saoirse sees Thanea, she jumps up and runs over to give her a hug. Thanea awkwardly reciprocates. Saoirse apologises for letting the team down in the tournament. Everyone reassures her that they lost as a team and did well considering their inexperience.

With Saoirse clearly not possessing her full faculties, she pulls Thanea to one side, insisting that they be allowed to have a private chat. Torbra and [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) reluctantly agree. Saoirse tells Thanea that she has been experimenting with the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), feeling it could give them a combat advantage in the tournament final. It has clearly given her a new ability, but at the cost of the psychedelic effects she is currently experiencing. Thanea relates through her herbalist/alchemical background.

Saoirse tells Thanea that she wants to try to find a way to gain the benefits of the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) without the downsides. Thanea is encouraging, but tells Saoirse that she should refrain from using the dust in this way any more as it will be bad for her health in the long run. Saoirse demonstrates her Meteoric Blast, absent mindedly destroying a street light across the road. Torbra and [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) run around the street corner to see what is going on.

The group, conscious of the commotion they've began to cause, hurriedly head off. Thanea drags Saoirse along, causing her to vomit all over Thanea's back. Saoirse tries to wipe the sick away but doesn't make it any better.

The group turn in for the night at the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md).

*[Long rest]*  
*[[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is no longer under the effect of the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md)]*

## Meeting with Elysia

In the morning the party make their way back to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) by way of teleportation thanks to [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md).

They aren't sure where [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) is. They ask [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) after he teleports them. He directs them to the narrow alley leading to the house, off the main stronghold road. Making their way there, the party finds the dingy alley not to their liking, resigned to the rough and ready scenery being on-brand for them.

They make their way into [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) which is open. They ask [Amarin Hutchinson](../../characters/amarin-hutchinson.md) if they are in the right place, getting a terse confirmation. She directs the party up to the third floor.

The party makes their way to the third floor. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) knocks on the door, which is answered by [Alos Varkann](../../characters/alos-varkann.md) who remarks that they must be the new squad. As [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) enter the room behind him, they find [Tyburn Dalvos](../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) also in the room. The party make small talk with Tyburn about the building before he makes it clear that the pair are part of [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), that there are some squad changes being made, and more people will be here soon. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) confirms that they're [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) before Tyburn asks them about their participation in [Nature's Battle 27](../../storylines/ended/natures-battle-27.md).

Behind everyone the door to the room opens. In emerges [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) followed by [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) and [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md). Hidaar greets [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), seemingly unaware that they would cross paths today.

Elysia goes straight across the room to her desk, pulling out her [Astorrel map of South East Kardan](../../maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md) before unrolling it on the large table in the room's centre. She beckons everyone to encircle the table.

She kicks off the meeting, formally introducing [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) to [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and vice-versa, noting Starfall's participation in [Nature's Battle 27](../../storylines/ended/natures-battle-27.md) and that Hidaar and Sparrow are new to [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) as of today.

With pleasantries out of the way she makes her position as both squad's [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) clear and that this room will be their base of operations. She confirms that [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) will remain [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md), leading [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md). Then she informs [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) that she is being promoted to [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) herself and being placed in charge of [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), much to her surprise. She exchanges Torbra's existing military badge for her new one.

Elysia, fed up with [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)'s constant snarky remarks throughout, plainly asks Torbra if [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) ever shuts up, because she is getting tired of it.

As [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) are new to the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), Elysia gives them a run down of what it means to be part of an [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad, in particularly how missions work: being given them, requirements, time limits, and pay.

## A Request from the Major

As [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) wraps up introductions, [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md) enters the room, causing Elysia's demeanour to soften. Quinn is dismissive of her formality towards him before he introduces himself to the room, noting that he isn't expecting to see much of the squads.

He tells Elysia that he is begrudgingly here on request of [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) as he needs the help of [Tyburn Dalvos](../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) to figure out the status of [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md). Tyburn looks concerned towards Elysia who gives him a confirming nod, after which he grabs his scrying bowl from his desk at the back of the room and brings it over to the table.

With his hands over the bowl, he casts Scrying, the rocking water immediately becoming mirror still. He parts his hands, lowering his head over the bowl with his eyes closed. When he opens his eyes he stares right into the bowl as tears begin streaming down his face from both eyes.

*[Tyburn Dalvos](../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md):*
> All as one. All as one.  
> Darkness. Creaking. Darkness. Skittering.  
> Squawk. Squawk. Scraping. Scraping.  
> A head turns. An arm flexes. A chain rattles. Rattles. Rattles.  
> A light! Pillar of light fast widening. Filled by shadow. A man? Unsure, a person.  
> Descending. Descending. Flash and flicker. Stern face. Leather and steel.  
> Chains and bricks. Flesh and chains. Red skin. Purple skin. Yellow skin. Green skin.  
> Limp hands. Gravity's burden. Wooden floor. Crimson lake?  
> One, two, three. Incomplete sequence. Where is four? Incomplete. Incomplete.

The first teardrop to leave his face drips into the scrying pool, disturbing the water and snapping him out of his trance. He inhales sharply before coming back to his senses after a moment. He looks at Quinn and gives an account of what he saw:

*[Tyburn Dalvos](../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md):*
> He's alive. He's chained up somewhere dark. I think they've taken one of his legs. I couldn't make out the person who came into the room, but there was this scraping bird call?...

Elysia is confused by the bird call. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) asks if it was a raven, but Tyburn is unsure. [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) notes that magpies make a scraping noise when protecting their nests.

Quinn is bemused by the account and subsequent conversation, still clearly not bothered by Levelle's request. He flippantly says to Elysia that he'll pass this information on before beginning to leave. He turns back and tells Elysia that if she needs anything she should get in touch. Then he leaves the room.

Elysia bemoans the ridiculous day she is having, before checking that Tyburn is alright. Tyburn confirms, wiping the tears from his face.

## [The Meteoric Threat](../../storylines/the-meteoric-threat.md)

[Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) is keen to talk about their mission, setting the scene for their collective [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) work going forward. She makes it clear that she wants everyone to have the same level of knowledge and share their information.

She sets the scene by outlining the potential threat of the meteors. They are an unknown and as such, may pose a threat to the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). She worries that they are some sort of [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) weapon that is a prelude to the resumption of open warfare. She is more worried of what else it could be.

She walks through the [timeline](../../history/timeline.md) of events that she and [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) are so far aware of, proceeding chronologically. She draws on her map, placing crosses in specific locations and circling rough areas.

| [Timeline](../../history/timeline.md) | [Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) | Investigation | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| -7mo | [Humar Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md) | Found by [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) out on mission. | Found waterlogged crater, small [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) pieces. |
| -5mo | [Silethwaite Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) | Heard rumours of a [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) impact.<br>Contracted [The Morning Chasers](../../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) to investigate. | Returned with word of strange creature attacks & den description. |
| -4mo | [Tresenda Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) | [Tyburn Dalvos](../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) scrying vision.<br>Landed in the valley. | [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) unable to investigate. |
| -3mo| [Carnmere Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/carnmere-meteorite.md) | Heard of unaccounted for deaths near Carnmere.<br>[Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) sent to investigate. | [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) returned with no evidence. |
| -2mo | [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) | [Tyburn Dalvos](../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) scrying vision.<br>Landed near [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md). | [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) sent to investigate.<br>[Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) found by [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md).<br>Creatures found and defeated. |

When Elysia mentions the [Humar Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md) pieces, she pulls 3 out from her pocket to show the group, passing one each to [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) and [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) to examine. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) asks Torbra if she can look at it. Torbra passes it to her. Saoirse observes that it looks similar in shape, size, and material as the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md).

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) asks Elysia if this is all they found. Elysia confirms that they found no other pieces, but the ones she possesses were enough for [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) to begin doing their own research.

When Elysia explains their information about mysterious deaths in Carnmere, Saoirse asks if there were other reports of deaths in Silethwaite or the [Tresenda Pass](../../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). Elysia explains that there were no such reports from Silethwaite (only injuries), while [Tresenda Pass](../../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) is too remote for them to have any information.

Regarding the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), Elysia reveals that Tyburn was able to predict its landing using his scrying pool, allowing [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) to be dispatched in advance of its landing, arriving 2 days after it crash landed.

Elysia asks [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) to provide an account of their dealings with the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). Saoirse gives Torbra a stern stare, indicating that Torbra shouldn't say too much. Torbra explains their journey to the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) and their encounter with the [Meteoric Watchers](../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) within, as well as the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) which glowed purple. She mis-remembers the encounter, telling the room that one of the two watchers they fought teleported away, when in fact they killed both that they fought.

Torbra attempts to lie about the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), claiming that they collected some powder that they gave to [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md), who had it on his person when he was kidnapped. Elysia doesn't buy Torbra's story (natural 1), prompting her to remind the squad about the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) that she has seen in their possession while they were in [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

Elysia asks to see it. Saoirse relents, placing the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) on the table. Everyone in the room moves closer to get a better look. [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) comments how it looks like a dragon egg.

[Alos Varkann](../../characters/alos-varkann.md) asks for more details of the [meteoric watchers](../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md). [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) explains their appearance, the matching material makeup, their blade arms and teleportation ability, and their resistance to Torbra's halberd strikes. Torbra gives [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and Thanea a sheet of her paper each so they can draw a watcher. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)'s drawing is crude, but Thanea's is detailed enough to give a good sense of the creatures. [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) asks what noise they make, to which Thanea informs him that they are unnervingly silent.

When they explain that the watchers collapse into dust on their death, Saoirse says that [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) collected some. Thanea produces her pouch of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) which is primarily gravel from the cave floor. Elysia pours some into her hand and pokes through it before returning it to the pouch and pocketing it.

The conversation turns to the purple light. [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) explain that it was coming from the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) until Saoirse jumped onto it and passed out. Elysia asks Tyburn to examine the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). He casts Detect Magic, reporting that there is a faint magical essence which indicates a magic that has since left it.

Elysia asks if [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) know how to get the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) to glow again. They do not.

## Handing Out Missions

With all of the information about [the meteoric threat](../../storylines/the-meteoric-threat.md) shared, [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) impresses upon everyone the seriousness and urgency of their work. They must investigate all of the leads they are aware of and see if anything more can be learned.

| Squad | Mission | Bounty | Time Limit |
| --- | --- | ---:| --- |
| [Astral Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) | Investigate the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) | [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md): 30 gp<br>[Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md): 35 gp | 20 days |
| [Starfall Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) | [Talk to the Morning Chasers](../../storylines/ended/talk-to-the-morning-chasers.md) | [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md): 20 gp<br>[Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md): 25 gp | 1 day |

Elysia wants [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) to conduct a proper search of where the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) landed. She tells [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) that if one of the creatures got away, it needs finding. She makes it clear to Hidaar that they are being given what should be the "easy mission" so that the newly configured [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) have some time to get to know each other and learn to work together as a team. Hidaar tells Elysia that he will have them leave following the briefing.

Elysia tells [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) that their first mission will allow them to "dip their toes in the water" of [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) missions. She wants them to [talk to the Morning Chasers](../../storylines/ended/talk-to-the-morning-chasers.md) themselves, using their knowledge of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) as context to look for any missed information of note.

She gives an impression of [the Morning Chasers](../../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md), painting them as capable, quick acting, and pleasant people, if not somewhat cocky. She indicates that they are based in the [Sunrise District](../../places/districts/sunrise-district.md) of [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) and that their leader is a gnomish woman called [Janneke Borflast](../../characters/janneke-borflast.md).

## Getting to Work

When [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) asks if anyone has any questions before they begin, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) asks if she can have the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) back. Elysia explains that she would like to give [Tyburn Dalvos](../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) further opportunity to study it today, denying it to her.

Saoirse asks if she can take Thanea's [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) with her instead, explaining that she would like to continue experimenting with it herself. Elysia asks if she has had any success so far, but Saoirse tells her she hasn't. Elysia opts to keep it, telling Saoirse that their meteoric evidence is currently limited, so until they have more, they need to preserve what they do have. This frustrates Saoirse. Elysia keeps the pouch of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) on her person while moving the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) onto her desk.

[Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) leaves the room and [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md), intent on beginning their mission.
