## Planning the [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) Approach

### 18:00

[Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) continues planning the party's approach to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) through [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) itself. He begins by asking the party what they can do to keep themselves out of sight. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) once again impresses upon Sparrow the usefulness of her Disguise Self ability.

Sparrow begins drawing a crude map of [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md), with its two districts, the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md), and its gatehouses clearly visible.

While he is doing this, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) explains to Sparrow that she is good at being persuasive, casting Charm Person on him, succeeding. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) asks Sparrow about his grooming routine, which makes him blush. He continues with his drawing.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) asks Sparrow about his wasps, so he explains the bond that they have to each other. He uses Mage Hand through the wasps to pour a glass of wine on the table. Torbra visibly recoils, while [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) wishes she had friends of her own. When she asks why wasps and not bees, Sparrow explains that wasps can sting more than once.

Once finished, Sparrow shows the party his map of [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md). He begins explaining that getting into the [Sunset District](../../places/districts/sunset-district.md) through the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) will be the largest challenge, as citizens are the only ones able to pass through.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) asks about going via [Duskmere](../../places/rivers-lakes/duskmere.md), but Sparrow advises against it as the [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) docks will be checking the citizenship of those docking up.

Sparrow tells the group that only those with [military badges](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md) can proceed through the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) gatehouses. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) may be able to use Disguise Self to appear as if she has one, but she cautions against that approach as the details are unlikely to appear accurate under scrutiny.

Sparrow presents the party with 3 choices on how to get into the [Sunset District](../../places/districts/sunset-district.md):

- Get through a gatehouse directly.
- Go over the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md).
- Go under the wall via the sewers.

The party gravitates towards making their way through the sewers. Sparrow isn't sure if there would be guards in or around the sewers as they've not been inside them before. Judging by the party's trajectory south west from [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), Sparrow cautions that there may be an increased [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) presence in the city that may cause unknown problems for them.

Sparrow suggests proceeding through the gatehouse himself to check where the sewer would lead, before regrouping with the party and proceeding in with them.

[Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) contemplates whether it would be best to approach the city during the day and attempt to blend in with the crowds, or go under cover of night.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) asks if Sparrow can communicate with the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) through magical means, but he cannot. He hopes that [Sarleen Truestriker](../../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md) reaching [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) might bring a message to [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md), but this is an unknown factor and the party would have to wait to find out.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) suggests that if they get into trouble in the sewers, it would be an isolated incident that they could control. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) wonder if they'd be able to blend in while in the aristocratic [Sunset District](../../places/districts/sunset-district.md). They both express an interest in washing their bloodied clothes so they can use them to fit in better than the plain robes they bought in [Frizthwaite](../../places/villages/frizthwaite.md).

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) uses Druidcraft to get a reading of the upcoming weather. Cupped between her hands she sees grey clouds representing the following day's cloudy weather.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) suggests that [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) could use Disguise Self to appear wealthy so that the rest of the party could pose as her entourage. Sparrow explains that the need for a military badge is just about getting into the [Sunset District](../../places/districts/sunset-district.md) - it need not be visible once inside.

Sparrow warns that the sewers may be locked. They show the party their thieves' tools for lock picking, offering them to anyone who can use them. When nobody indicates that they can, he keeps them for himself to use.

Hidaar asks if they've formulated a plan yet, prompting the party to choose their approach. They agree to proceed through the sewers that evening under cover of night.

## Preparing to Depart

The party prepares to leave the [Ulburn Astorrel House](../../places/buildings/ulburn-astorrel-house.md) in around an hour.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) head upstairs to wash their bloodied clothes. There is a bathroom with a "bathtub" barrel. They are both surprised to find no buckets of water on hand for washing, instead finding a tap for dispensing water (regular plumbing). They are both curious and unsure how it works, but experiment and figure out how to twist the tap to start and stop the flow of water. Both believe the water supply is likely magical in nature.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) isn't sure which products in the room are best for cleaning, so she experiments, managing to get a lot of the blood out of the clothes while they soak up the water in the tub.

They head back downstairs and hang their clothes up in front of the fireplace in the main room, leaving it here to drip dry and dry in the warmth of the fire over the remainder of the hour.

*[Short rest]*

### 19:00

It is now fully dark outside. Looking through the window, there are few to no people out on the main street of [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md).

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) go to check on their drying clothes. They are damp, less wet than they left them, but likely to make them colder during the cold night and in the wind.

[Sparrow on the Autumn pine](../../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) grabs their backpack, short bow and two short swords, surprising the party with how well armed they are for what the party is hoping is a peaceful trip through [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md). Sparrow explains that if they were [magicborn on the run](../../storylines/ended/magicborn-on-the-run.md), the [Sunset District](../../places/districts/sunset-district.md) is the last place they'd want to have to go to.

Torbra remarks that they don't really have a choice. Sparrow explains that they could try to live away from settlements or leave the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) entirely if they wished. The party resolves to press on to [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md).

## Leaving [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md)

Checking the street outside, Sparrow declares it's time to head out. They all head out into street, proceeding carefully.

Sparrow leads them out of [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md) via a side street, 30 minutes south to the [Great Astor Road](../../places/roads/great-astor-road.md). Stopping for a moment to check the road, the party proceeds onwards. As they crest the road they get their first view of [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md), though under darkness. Night lighting gives the impression of the buildings in the [Sunrise District](../../places/districts/sunrise-district.md), and a black line cut through the street lights suggests where the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) is. Two white illuminated spires are visible, the smaller of which ([Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md)) is visible on the left.

Sparrow points at the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md), exclaiming to the party that it is their target.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) questions their sewer plan, asking about how Sparrow will find the end of the sewers for them. Sparrow makes it clear that he wants to stay with the party as they navigate the sewers, so if they go ahead to scout out the sewer exit, they'll then return to the party.

## [Sunrise District](../../places/districts/sunrise-district.md)

The party makes their way into the outskirts of the [Sunrise District](../../places/districts/sunrise-district.md). They manage to keep out of sight in side streets. There are some people wandering around under dim candle-lit streets, but no [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) as far as they can see.

The [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) becomes more prominent as they approaching it, towering twice as tall as the closest two storey building. There is an intentional gap between the last building and the wall itself, making it harder to approach it without being seen.

Peering at the wall from a back street, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) sees the north east gatehouse, not able to see how thick the wall is as it disappears out of sight through the gatehouse itself. She is able to see 2 [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) guarding the entrance.

Sparrow looks further right along the wall and spots the sewer grate against the wall, directly underneath one of its guard towers. The party agrees that someone should go ahead to see if it is open before returning to the party. Sparrow volunteers.

Sparrow hands their bag off to the party, pulling out their thieves tools. They stealthily make their way across the clearing by the wall, running diagonally to the sewer grate. When they arrive at it they cast Fog Cloud, a blast of fog emerging from under their robes which waft upwards as it disperses. The party watch on as the fog continues to linger around the sewer grate - they lose sight of Sparrow entirely.

Sparrow attempts to pick the lock he finds on the grate. He fails his first attempt but succeeds on a retry, breaking the padlock keeping the grate shut. With that he dashes back to the back street the party are waiting in.

While Sparrow makes their way back, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) notices one of the patrolling guards on the wall above stop suddenly, to the right of the guard tower above the sewer grate. The guard to its right continues their patrol. She cautions the party to lay low for a moment. With this, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) casts Pass Without Trace on the party.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) continues to watch the guard on the wall above. With their natural 20 perception check they're able to see that the guard looks inquisitive rather than concerned, looking down into the darkness below. The guard thought they heard a noise, but looking down is unable to discern anything in the darkness.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) suggests the party waits for the guard to move on. The guard raises their hand to their brow. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) forces the party back into the side street a little for safety. She then watches the guard proceed on their patrol back to the guard tower, who has resumed their patrol.

## Entering the Sewers

The whole party crosses the gap to the sewer grate. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) rolls a natural 20 + 10 = 30 for her stealth check. On their arrival they proceed into the still lingering fog, seeing the sewer grate directly in front of them. It is made of perpendicular metal bars in a frame that is hinged so that it opens against the wall itself.

Sparrow offers to drop his Fog Cloud but cautions that it is making it harder for them to be seen. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) wastes no time in jumping directly into the opened sewer grate. She lands in 2ft of sewage waste, creating a splash that isn't too audible. Hearing the splash below, Torbra jumps down next, landing with a much more audible splash, splashing faeces in [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)'s face. The guards on the wall above hear a sound below and begin moving to investigate.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and Torbra are stood in the sewer, still enveloped in the cloud of fog, unable to see beyond a few feet in front of them. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) hears no 

Sparrow pulls a length of rope out of his bag, lowering it into the sewer below before tying the end off in the hole that the padlock was threaded through to lock the sewer grate. He encourages [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) to descend first. They do carefully, lowering themselves into the water. Unsighted, Sparrow closes the sewer grate while hanging from the rope, closing it with only a minor metal-on-metal clang. Once he descends into the sewer, he ends the Fog Cloud, allowing those with darkvision to see the chamber.

The party see the sewer before them. A 20ft wide corridor with no raised path proceeds for about 50ft before coming to a crossroad junction. They are standing in 2ft of sewage, with visible solid matter floating in it. It is sludgy but still mostly liquid.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) asks Sparrow if she can borrow one of "his friends", a wasp. He agrees, holding one out several on his finger. She asks if one can land on her finger, which one does at Sparrow's command. She touches it, casting Light on it, turning the wasp into a floating lantern which illuminates the sewer. Sparrow is impressed with her "good trick".

## Guards Investigate

The party hears talking from behind them. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md)'s keen ears pick up the sound of a masculine voice saying:

*[Astorrel guard](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) 1:*

> Sounded like it came from over here.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) shushes the group and dismisses the Light spell, making the sewer go pitch black again. They all proceed forward slowly, trying not to make too much noise. As they proceed, the noises grow closer. The sound of the sewer grate being lifted and dropped suddenly echoes through the chamber.

*[Astorrel guard](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) 2:*

> It's open. Someone must be down here!

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) questions why Sparrow didn't lock the grate behind them. They explain how they looped the rope through the hole and couldn't remove it as they were hanging from the rope when they closed the grate. The party proceeds deeper into the sewer.

*[Astorrel guard](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) 1:*

> Go and get the Guard Sergeant!

Sparrow pulls a smaller length of rope from their backpack. They plunge the rope and their arms deep into the sewer water, covering most of their body in excrement. They pull back out without the rope having cast Snare in the middle of the ground. While doing this the wasps buzz above his back to avoid the water. He shakes much of the excrement from his arms.

The party reaches the crossroads. Sparrow explains that proceeding straight forward will probably take them out of the tunnel on the direct opposite side of the wall, and that the passageways left and right must run under the wall itself.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) convinces Sparrow to part with another wasp, which he bids farewell to:

*[Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md):*

> We part ways here my friend. Good luck.

With Light cast on it by [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md), Sparrow commands it to proceed down the right tunnel as a distraction while the party proceed left, opting to not take the most obvious route in case there are already guards gathering on the other side.

## Heading Left

As the party begins to head along the path left of the crossroad, they hear the sound of the grate opening behind them. They proceed onward, managing to proceed quickly and quietly. As they continue, the Light spell becomes out of range of [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and the wasp's light fades.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) leads the party while [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) are at the back of the group. As the party nears the next crossroad, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) looks back to see an [Astornox guard](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) emerge into the crossroad behind them, holding a light torch. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) silently signals to the party to draw their attention. The party presses on carefully.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and Sparrow once again send a wasp away from them. At the second crossroad the wasp is sent left, towards the outside of the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md), while the party turn right towards its inside (this section of sewer laid out identically to the previous one).

As this happens, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) witnesses the guard looking intently in their direction before breaking into a run directly towards them, the splashes catching everyone's attention as they approach.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) goes to cast Eldritch Blast at the guard, using their eldritch invocation to blast him 10ft backwards in the process. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) tries to stop her but [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) beats her initiative roll, loosing the spell before [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) has a chance to react.

The Eldritch Blast sprays sewage along the tunnel until it connects with the [Astornox guard](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md), knocking him 10ft backward through the air, knocking him prone in the sewage beyond. As he goes his lit torch hits the tunnel wall and floor before plunging into the water, going out. That portion of the tunnel goes pitch black, hiding the guard's fate. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md)'s natural 20 attack roll and 11 points of damage was exactly enough to kill the guard in one hit, not possible without a critical hit.

## Exiting the Sewer

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) immediately turns and runs, finding the rest of the group running to the sewer grate on the inside of the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md). Sparrow has bolted ahead, already at the grate, lighting a torch and passing it to [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md). Between them both they try several times to throw another length of rope so that it passes through the bars, Sparrow eventually succeeding, holding both ends of the rope.

Sparrow passes the ends of the rope to Torbra, asking her to hold them taut and to keep them still. She does, while Sparrow attempts to climb up the rope. He falls almost immediately, submerging himself in the sewage. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) offers to hold him on her shoulders, but is kicked away accidentally by Sparrow. Fortunately he has hold of the ropes and ascends to the sewer grate. While dangling from one arm he manages to file the padlock open with some effort, before dropping back down to the sewer floor.

Sparrow takes the rope down from the grate before summoning their wasps, attempting to cast Mage Hand to open the heavy grate, failing miserably. He shouts for the party to open it quickly.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) contemplates using Eldritch Blast to open it but thinks better of it.

The sound of splashing is heard as multiple [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) run towards them from the previous sewer junction.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) attempts to climb on Torbra's shoulders to reach the grate. She succeeds but on pushing the grate she falls from Torbra, landing feet first in the sewer harmlessly as Torbra gets out of her way.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) takes up position next to the party, preparing to use Fey Presence the moment a guard rounds the corner of the junction. Sparrow darts back to the center of the junction, plunging another length of rope under the sewage and casting Snare again.

The splashes grow louder.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) tries to climb onto Torbra and open the grate again. This time she is able to push the grate open with a loud clang as it opens fully and hits the inside of the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md). Sparrow attaches their last length of rope to a grappling hook and uses his wasps and Mage Hand to levitate it to the sewer grate's edge, pulling it taut to secure it.

At this point the first [Astornox Guard](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) comes into view in the junction. He steps on Sparrow's Snare, lifting him from the ground, inverting him, and levitating him in the air as he screams in bewilderment.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) climbs the rope first as the rest of the party hastily follow. Torbra then [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) climb out last.

## Emerging Into the [Sunset District](../../places/districts/sunset-district.md)

The party emerge from the sewer into the [Sunset District](../../places/districts/sunset-district.md), on a street that closely borders the inside of the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md). Soft magical street lamp light cuts through the darkness, giving a sense of where they are.

As the last of the party climb out onto the street, 6 [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) emerge through the gatehouse 40ft left of them, including the [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md), [Tonnol Grisham](../../characters/tonnol-grisham.md).

*[Astornox Guard Sergeant](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md):*

> There they are!
