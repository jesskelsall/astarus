## Rushing for Help

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) leaves [the Dog's Groke](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md), rushing back to [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) to retrieve [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md). She has no trouble getting through the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) gatehouse, flashing her military badge as she goes.

On arrival at [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) she asks [Amarin Hutchinson](../../characters/amarin-hutchinson.md) where Elysia is. She points Saoirse up to the third floor. Barging into the room, Saoirse finds that only Elysia is present. She instinctively emerges from behind her desk, drawing both daggers and cartwheeling over her desk before realising it is Saoirse.

Saoirse tells Elysia that there has been a situation with their mission. Elysia starts preparing her crossbow on her table while Saoirse begins explaining. As Saoirse mentions that [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) found a [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), Elysia immediately drops the crossbow and starts sprinting toward the door. The pair start running out of the building.

The pair run all the way back to [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md), Saoirse doing her best to explain the situation to Elysia as they go. Elysia wordlessly follows.

## In [the Dog's Groke](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md)

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) takes a seat downstairs while [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) tries to console [Janneke Borflast](../../characters/janneke-borflast.md). She is still sobbing over the mangled corpse of [Slaine Alabaster](../../characters/slaine-alabaster.md). She tries to put on a brave face, wiping off the tears streaming down her face, but doesn't say anything.

Torbra attempts to move the body, but it is too slick with blood, causing her to drop it almost immediately. This sets Janneke off crying again, causing her to run downstairs and throw herself behind the bar, curling into a sitting fetal position.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) checks on her. She laments not being able to protect him. When [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) asks her if there is anything they can do for her, she asks her to burn the body. She agrees to and heads upstairs, telling Torbra and [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) of this wish. Thanea advises her to wait until Saoirse returns with Elysia. They briefly discuss how long she might take, and whether she'll even return.

## Elysia Arrives

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) leads [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) to [the Dog's Groke](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md). She climbs through the broken window that Torbra and [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) entered through. Elysia doesn't miss a beat and dives through before heading upstairs towards the talking she hears. She draws her blades, but Saoirse tells her that they won't be necessary. Regardless she arrives upstairs to the surprise of everyone else, daggers in hand.

Upon seeing the rest of [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) she relaxes slightly, putting a dagger away. She goes over to Slaine's body and inspects it, sampling some of the blood with her fingers and licking it. She asks what happened.

Torbra begins to explain, but Elysia is impatient and interrupts her, asking specifically what happened to the corpse. Torbra gives a very basic explanation of the corpse being a combination of a person and a [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). Elysia is clearly struggling to parse the situation, everything she is being told expanding her horizons. Torbra informs her that Slaine wasn't able to let go of the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), and as soon as the party tried to remove it from him, he transformed into a creature similar to a [Meteoric Watcher](../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md).

Saoirse then admits to Elysia that she is bound to the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) in some way, similar to how [Slaine Alabaster](../../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) was bound to the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md). She is worried that the same thing will happen to her in a couple of weeks. Elysia gives her a sustained sterned look, keeping a watchful eye on her. She asks Saoirse how she even knows, to which she explains that she had a messed up dream in the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), and has a compulsion to be near [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) at all times. Elysia turns to Torbra and tells her to keep Saoirse away from [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) - that's an order. Torbra acknowledges.

Elysia asks who the corpse was. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) tells her that it was Slaine, but she doesn't know who that is. She sees [Kieran Bennington](../../characters/kieran-bennington.md) hiding in one of the bedrooms and sternly ushers him out onto the landing. She asks Kieran where their leader is. He tells her that Janneke is downstairs. Elysia orders [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) to go and get her and she complies.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) finds [Janneke Borflast](../../characters/janneke-borflast.md) still hiding behind the bar. She tells her that Elysia wants her to come upstairs. Janneke recognises her name as the orange tiefling, so she agrees, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) helping her over the bar. The pair head back upstairs.

Elysia greets her but Janneke is terse in her response. Elysia lays the blame on Janneke quite impolitely, pointing out that [the Morning Chasers](../../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) hid something (the [Silethwaite meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md)) from [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) and now one of her own is now dead. She asks if they are hiding anything else. As the colour leaves Janneke's face she mumbles a response, telling her that there was nothing else. Elysia opens her mouth to start shouting but catches herself and stops. Elysia asks Janneke if she's talked to [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md). When she says yes, Elysia looks satisfied.

Elysia goes back to Slaine's corpse, asking Torbra in confusion what exactly happened to the body to make it so unrecognisable. Torbra gives a description of the [Meteoric Humanoid](../../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md), their experiences fighting it (tying it up and its wailing attack), the way all of the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) fell from Slaine's corpse when it died, and the subsequent movement of the dust. Saoirse accompanies Torbra's description with Minor Illusion recreations of the creature.

Elysia notices grains of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) stuck between the floorboards and then the iron pot on the other side of the landing, confirming with Torbra that it is the pot from her story. She goes over to it, puts some fabric over the lid, and picking it up. She tells the party that she needs to take it back to [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md).

From the moment she is aware of the pot she keeps a stern eye on Saoirse, looking for her making a move for the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). Saoirse notices this, taunting Elysia dismissively before grabbing a few grains of dust from the floor and licking them out of her palm. Elysia watches very intently for a moment before catching herself.

Next Elysia asks the party if anyone is good at drawing, as it would be useful to add a record of Slaine's corpse to the mission report. Saoirse with the help of Thanea creates a Minor Illusion of the body, perfectly accurate and dripping blood into Saoirse's hand. Elysia is impressed, suggesting Saoirse memorise the corpse as best as she can to help with recalling the details later. Elysia's stern façade cracks as she reveals that she expects to see the corpse in her nightmares soon enough.

## Cremating the Body

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) asks if Elysia would like to stay for the cremation of the corpse, catching Elysia off guard. She tells her that she doesn't care and to do as she pleases. When [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) tells her that it was [Janneke Borflast](../../characters/janneke-borflast.md)'s request, she says that she doesn't care, not phased by Janneke still being in earshot. Elysia urges [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) not to burn down the building.

As Elysia begins to leave, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) wastes no time casting Produce Flame on the body, catching it alight. She sees the floorboards starting to burn around the corpse. The rest of the party leave her to it, Thanea heading downstairs after Elysia. Janneke and Kieran Alabaster close themselves into a room to mentally shield themselves from the burning.

Without little notice the floorboards crack and give way, the body and the floorboard pieces underneath it plummeting to the floor below. It all comes crashing down onto a bar table, setting it alight as the body rolls off and onto the floor. This happens in plain view of Elysia right as she reaches the bottom of the stairs.

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> What the fuck are you doing?

Elysia asks the party if they can do anything about the fire that is starting to spread to the floor of the inn. Saoirse reminds Torbra that if this goes badly, it reflects badly on her as the [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md). Torbra, Thanea, and [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) rush downstairs and throw water from their water skins over the fire. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)'s flies out of her hands, landing in the fire on the table. The flames burn lower but still persist. Saoirse runs upstairs to grab some bedding to smother the fire, but as she runs back downstairs with one, Thanea casts Ray of Frost. This puts out the fire, the frost instantly melting under the latent heat of the fire.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) finds her water skin on the floor on the other side of the table, slightly charred. Elysia gets stern with [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), reminding her of what she just said about not burning the building down. When [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) retorts that the building looks fine to her, she draws a dagger, throws it into the air and catches it before pointing it at [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and shooting her a dirty look, signalling her not to try her luck.

Saoirse throws the blanket over the corpse, but Janneke urges her to leave. Elysia gets Janneke to unlock the door. Elysia with the pot of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) and the party head back to [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md). When Saoirse expresses a want for a drink, Elysia tells her to come back to the building first as she has someone she wants Saoirse to meet.

## Remembering [the Alley](../../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md)

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) tries to recount the mysterious figures ([Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) and [Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md)) that she say in an [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md) alley while under the effects of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). She is only able to recall that they were arguing, one of them came over to try and touch her, and that the same person had a full face helmet on.

## Back at [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md)

Everyone arrives back at the third floor of [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md). [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) places the iron pot on her desk, comparing [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s pouch of dirty [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) with the contents of the pot, somewhat out of line of sight of everyone else.

Elysia thanks the party for their work today, noting that events at [the Dog's Groke](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md) clearly didn't go to plan but that it was not [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s fault. She tells [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) that the mission is more or less concluded, so now it is time for her to write her report so that [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) can get paid. She explains the specifics of how report writing works and how it needs to be completed inside of the mission deadline, so it must be done today.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) asks if Torbra is provided with writing supplies. Elysia points over to a stack of papers on her desk as well as ink and a quill. Torbra only takes what she needs.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) goes outside to admire the view from the terrace, seeing the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md), [Diamond Prime](../../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md), and understanding where [Astor Square](../../places/structures/astor-square.md) would be between the buildings. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) asks for cleaning supplies to clean up the balcony. Elysia doesn't have any, so [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) heads downstairs to speak with [Amarin Hutchinson](../../characters/amarin-hutchinson.md) who begrudgingly provides a bucket and broom. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) spends some time beginning to scrub at the heavily stained terrace.

Once Torbra begins writing her mission report, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) asks to speak with [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) at one side of the room. She expresses her fear of what happened to Slaine happening to her, and asks that Elysia try to help her prevent that. She tells Saoirse that she will call in a favour from the [Astorrel Captain](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-captain.md) of [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md), [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md). When Saoirse questions the favour, Elysia says that she doesn't want to tell him what they know. She takes all of the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) and places it behind her desk, keeping everything out of clear view. She then leaves to get Mergin from the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md).

As soon as she leaves, Saoirse goes over to the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). She is able to sense a draw to it, willing her to be closer to it. She resists and moves away.

[Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) starts writing her mission report, sitting at the big table along the middle of the room. Thanea and Saoirse sit with her to help, reminding her of the details as she goes. Of note they all agree to not mention that [Kieran Bennington](../../characters/kieran-bennington.md) is [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), lying on the report that [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) was the one to cast Dispel Magic on the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md).

## Breaking the Curse

[Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) returns with [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md). She points him toward [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md). He approaches her, recognising her from [Nature's Battle 27](../../storylines/ended/natures-battle-27.md) and [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), making some light hearted small talk. He tries to diagnose Saoirse's affliction, first checking with her if resting has helped her condition - it has not.

Saoirse asks Elysia how much Mergin knows. This prompts Mergin to ask what is going on. Elysia shuts the question down by declaring it a need to know basis, causing Mergin to back off. Elysia gives Saoirse a wild cautionary glance.

Saoirse tries to describe how she feels, explaining a draw to an object that she has. She off-handedly compares it to a curse, causing Mergin to think it could be one. He gently places a hand on her shoulder and casts Remove Curse. As soon as he does Saoirse falls unconscious. He rushes to embrace her as she begins to fall, stopping her but struggling. Elysia comes over and helps. She takes Saoirse over to a couch and lays her down.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) questions why Mergin didn't cast while she was already sitting or lying down. He explains that the curse could have compelled her to stop him, so he needed to act fast and without warning.

### Saoirse Patron Chat 3

While [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is unconscious, she hears the familiar voice of her patron:

*[Effie Silttooth](../../characters/effie-silttooth.md):*
> Well, I guess that's that sorted then. When you come to, I have a gift for you, but I will need a favour. Go to the general store near the southern gate.

### Cured

After 5 minutes Saoirse wakes up. She no longer feels any meteoric compulsions, her [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md) curse removed. Despite being knocked out she feels refreshed and rejuvenated.

*[[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is no longer cursed with [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md)]*

Saoirse thanks Mergin, declaring that she feels better. Mergin begins to take his leave. Elysia thanks him before Mergin declares that they are now even, the favour cashed in. Elysia looks frustrated by this but relaxes when she looks over at Saoirse. She asks Saoirse how she is feeling, learning that she feels good.

Elysia proceeds to grab the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) and drop it in Saoirse's lap, keenly observing to see what she will do. Saoirse is very dismissive of this, stating that she feels no compulsions or attraction to it. Elysia then quickly swipes it away from her, stopping to observe her reaction. Saoirse plays along and tries to grab it but is unable, fooling Elysia that she is lying. When Saoirse reveals that she was only messing with Elysia, annoyance quickly turns to relief as Elysia is satisfied with what she is observing.

## Choosing the Next Mission

Before the party head off for a well earned drink, Elysia summons [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) around the table. She congratulates them for completing their first mission, parcelling out their mission reward coins as promised.

She reiterates the need to be quick and states that the party will head out tomorrow on their next mission, giving [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) the choice of which mission they'd like to tackle first. With Elysia's [Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../../maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md) still unrolled on the table, she runs through the four available options:

| Mission | Time Limit | Reward |
| --- | ---:| ---:|
| [Look for Signs of a Meteorite Near Carnmere](../../storylines/upcoming/look-for-signs-of-a-meteorite-near-carnmere.md) | 14 days | [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md): 25 gp<br>[Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md): 20 gp |
| [Investigate the Humar Meteorite Crater](../../storylines/investigate-the-humar-meteorite-crater.md) | 7 days | [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md): 20 gp<br>[Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md): 15 gp |
| [Find the Silethwaite Meteorite Crater](../../storylines/upcoming/find-the-silethwaite-meteorite-crater.md) | 21 days | [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md): 35 gp<br>[Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md): 30 gp |
| [Search for a Meteorite in Tresenda Pass](../../storylines/upcoming/search-for-a-meteorite-in-tresenda-pass.md) | 21 days | [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md): 50 gp<br>[Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md): 40 gp |

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) asks if their pay is evidence based or not. Elysia explains that she is currently in discussions with [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md) about extra pay for specific evidence returned. She outlines the following evidence they would like returning if possible (not providing bounty values):

| Evidence | Reward |
| --- | ---:|
| [Meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), pouch | 30 gp |
| [Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), inert | 200 gp |
| [Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), able to glow | 500 gp |
| [Meteoric Watcher](../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) | 1,000 gp |

Saoirse advises that Elysia keeps away from the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), noting what happened to her. Elysia assures her that she will get a box to keep it in.

Torbra debates the options, conferring with the party to decide together which they should choose. Torbra favours heading to Humar Estuary due to the short mission time and relatively high pay for their time.

Torbra confirms with Elysia that they pick the Humar Estuary mission as their next. Elysia formalises this, explaining that their mission timer starts in the morning.

Saoirse tries to get Elysia to provide healing potions for their mission but Elysia dismisses this, explaining that [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) are paid for their missions so that they can buy supplies and equipment themselves. She is sure that Saoirse can find someone selling healing potions in [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md).
