## Table Rules

- Natural 1s and 20s do not mean instant failures and successes (respectively) for skill checks and saving throws, as for the D&D 5e rules as written.
- Players may request to assist with or try a skill check for themselves only if they are proficient in that skill.
- [Inspiration Pool](../../mechanics/dm-inspiration.md)
- Laptops will not be allowed at the table in order to prevent players being obscured behind screens. Phones and tablets will be allowed.
- Players may choose how they want to represent their character sheet, with recommended options being using a paper character sheet, or creating a character on D&D Beyond.

## Safety Tools

- Veils and lines
- [Open Table Policy](../../mechanics/safety-tools/open-table-policy.md)
- [Check-in Cards](../../mechanics/safety-tools/check-in-cards.md)
- My door is always open: I am always available to chat about anything, privately if required, between sessions.

## Pairs

Prior to session zero, the four players were split into two groups of two. This would be used to create a campaign hook by having two different groups collide, with opportunities before that to develop each group's relationship and shared history.

| Group | Group |
|---|---|
| [Becca](../../players/becca.md)<br>[Sophie](../../players/sophie.md) | [Rin](../../players/rin.md)<br>[Viktorija](../../players/viktorija.md) |

## Pair Relationships

Two envelopes were placed on the table. They both contained the nature of each group's relationship between the pair of characters. All four players agreed on which group got which envelope.

|| Envelope || Envelope ||

## Pair Organisations

Four envelopes were placed on the table. Each contained a different organisation that operates in the [Nil'Savnic alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md). The envelopes were blank except for wax seals that provided a vague and semi-random differentiator.

Once each group chose an envelope, the other two were removed and the chosen envelopes were opened. Each card was read out in turn, alternating between groups.

|| Envelope | Envelope | Envelope | Envelope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Wax seal** | Fox | Dragonfly | Paper crane | Mechanical clock |

## Races

The race system was explained to the players. Each player would roll a d10. They would get a limited selection of races to choose from depending on their roll.

Additionally any "half races" (italics below) chosen necessitated a second roll of a d10. The other half of their lineage must then be picked from that selection of races. Racial traits must be picked from across both races, rather than benefiting from both races completely.

| d10 | Classification | Card | Races |||||
|:---:| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-4 | Common | [MC00-R-1](../../cards/MC00/MC00-R-1.md) | Dragonborn | Elf | Goliath | Orc | Tabaxi |
| 5-7 | Uncommon | [MC00-R-2](../../cards/MC00/MC00-R-2.md) | Dwarf | Goblin | *Half-orc* | Human | *Tiefling* |
| 8-9 | Rare | [MC00-R-3](../../cards/MC00/MC00-R-3.md) | Firbolg | *Half-elf* | Hobgoblin | Kobold | Satyr |
| 10 | Exceptional | [MC00-R-4](../../cards/MC00/MC00-R-4.md) | *Genasi* | *Kalashtar* | Leonin | Minotaur | *Shifter* |

| Player | Race 1 | Race 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Becca](../../players/becca.md) | Minotaur | |
| [Rin](../../players/rin.md) | Genasi (Air) | Elf (Wood) |
| [Sophie](../../players/sophie.md) | Goliath | |
| [Viktorija](../../players/viktorija.md) | Elf (Dark) | |

## Ability Scores & Starting Items

Players were introduced to a bargain relating to rolling their ability scores and bonus starting items. They would choose their rolling method individually, picking either the [4d6 method](../../mechanics/ability-score-method/4d6-method.md) or [3d6 method](../../mechanics/ability-score-method/3d6-method.md).

| Player | [Ability Score Method](../../mechanics/ability-score-method/ability-score-method.md) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | Total |
| --- | --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [Becca](../../players/becca.md) | [3d6 Method](../../mechanics/ability-score-method/3d6-method.md) | 17 | 10 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 53 |
| [Rin](../../players/rin.md) | [3d6 Method](../../mechanics/ability-score-method/3d6-method.md) | 12 | 11 | 11 | 9 | 8 | 6 | 57 |
| [Sophie](../../players/sophie.md) | [3d6 Method](../../mechanics/ability-score-method/3d6-method.md) | 14 | 14 | 12 | 12 | 10 | 7 | 69 |
| [Viktorija](../../players/viktorija.md) | [3d6 Method](../../mechanics/ability-score-method/3d6-method.md) | 17 | 15 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 9 | 71 |

For each player that chose the [3d6 method](../../mechanics/ability-score-method/3d6-method.md), a bonus item card would be placed on the table and drawn randomly by a player. This would give the party extra starting items at the cost of a higher likelihood of low ability scores.

All players agreed to use the [3d6 method](../../mechanics/ability-score-method/3d6-method.md) to maximise their starting items.

| Player | Card | Bonus Item(s) | Result |

## Character Creation

Each player spent the rest of session zero beginning to create their character.
