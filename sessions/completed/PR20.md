## Between Sessions

[Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) and [Mindira Flibfae](../../characters/mindira-flibfae.md) discuss with the party the circumstances around them being [magicborn on the run](../../storylines/ended/magicborn-on-the-run.md) and how they got to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) without being captured.

*[4 days later]*

The party remains in [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), guarded by [Garrick Rose](../../characters/garrick-rose.md). After an initial slew of visitors, the interest in the party wanes. As it does their stay becomes increasingly boring, but it is uneventful, with Garrick vigilantly guarding them and keeping up his offer of [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

## The Day of the Trial

The party wakes up and is given breakfast - a more extravagant spread than usual, which either indicates a need to look well fed for the trial, or a sort of thank you from the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

After the party finishes breakfast, [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) enters. They ask the party to look their best for today's trial. Despite [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) hogging the bathroom for the past 4 days, everyone is well bathed.

Having spent 4 days in the presence of the [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor, Saoirse is able to sense that there is something magical about it, but the anti-magic field present in [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) is making it too hard to figure out what exactly. She chooses to keep this to herself.

Levelle informs the party that they will be joining the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) trial for [the firbolg controversy](../../storylines/ended/the-firbolg-controversy.md) at around the half way point, after the initial debates have taken place. [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) will be taking them to [The Circle](../../places/buildings/the-circle.md) when it is their turn, during the witness phase.

They provide the party with some advice: as they will be in front of some of the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) generals, Levelle advises they be on their best behaviour, not speak out of turn, and that General Supreme [Corville Thornox](../../characters/corville-thornox.md) will be there himself, indicating the severity of the matter. Following that, Levelle leaves.

Saoirse worries that she can't really take the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) with her due to its size and the need for its secrecy. She summons Garrick into the room, asking for him to fetch [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) so that she may speak to her. He does so, but she does not appear prior to the trial.

When it becomes clear that Elysia isn't showing, Saoirse opts to have the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) placed in her box downstairs for safe keeping.

When it is time for the party to head to the trial, [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) arrives along with [Garrick Rose](../../characters/garrick-rose.md). He asks if they're ready. Saoirse asks Garrick to place the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) (wrapped in a bed sheet) placed into her box. He complies before bidding the party farewell, wishing them good luck for the trial.

Following the pleasantries, Mergin steps forward, once again asking the party if they're ready. When they say they are, he slams his staff against the floor while muttering some words under his breath, teleporting everyone but Garrick into [The Circle](../../places/buildings/the-circle.md). In an instant the location of everyone changes, causing some brief disorientation as the party is teleported for the first time.

## Arriving at the Trial

The party suddenly finds themselves at the back of [The Circle](../../places/buildings/the-circle.md), standing in the teleportation circle with [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md). He ushers them into one of the pews on the left side of the room where the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) are situated.

Saoirse asks [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) to palm her the pouch of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) in her possession while [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) sit down as asked. Saoirse whispers to Thanea to hand it to her but she refuses, both managing to keep their voices down. Once they've both sat down, Saoirse takes the pouch from Thanea.

[Kur Merkys](../../characters/kur-merkys.md) is observed sitting on the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) side of the room, glaring at the party. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and Torbra notice [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) and [Mindira Flibfae](../../characters/mindira-flibfae.md) sat on the front pew, with [Rowan Great Sile](../../characters/rowan-great-sile.md) between them. He turns around and waves at [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), who waves back.

The party notices [Alistair Hawthorn](../../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md) sitting amongst the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), Torbra recognising him. He stares back, cracks a smirk, then has a brief conversation with [Reeds in the Desert Oasis](../../characters/reeds-in-the-desert-oasis.md) sat behind him.

## Witness: [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)

[Polgast Mouldylog](../../characters/polgast-mouldylog.md) calls order and asks [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) to call their first witness. Levelle presents [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), who stands up.

Polgast asks [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) to give information about [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md). She explains the circumstances of his disappearance and what she has learned about him being taken by the [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) for being [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md). Polgast confirms with her that the forest he was taken from was the [Hawkswood](../../places/forests/hawkswood.md). He tells [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) that [Rowan Great Sile](../../characters/rowan-great-sile.md) explained that a clan of firbolgs exists in that forest, and asks if she is part of their clan. She explains that she isn't, and also isn't aware of their existence.

Polgast presses for more details of her father's disappearance. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) explains that her father led a solitary life away from anyone except herself and wouldn't hurt anyone. [Patricia Wilbenotel](../../characters/patricia-wilbenotel.md) casts Zone of Truth on her, which she doesn't resist, becoming aware that she can no longer lie. With the spell in effect she asks pointed questions of [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), who confirms that her father lived alone and wouldn't hurt anyone. Seemingly satisfied with her answers, Polgast resumes his questioning.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) details how she sought help from Heather Pentz before heading to [The Slippery Weasel](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md) to ask around for help. It was here that she met [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) who blackmailed her into helping him in exchange for details of her father's whereabouts. She also met the party at this point. [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) provided information about how the [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) captured her father and took him away to be conscripted.

With that, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) witnesses [Itharmund Steeleye](../../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) turn around and give a look to [Alistair Hawthorn](../../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md), who then nods.

Polgast asks [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) what she would do if the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) would turn over her father to her today. She explains that they'd find a new forest to live in that appears safer than their old place in the [Hawkswood](../../places/forests/hawkswood.md). [Anton Haverwick](../../characters/anton-haverwick.md) speaks up, asking [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) if she would like to keep away from others and do them no harm. She agrees.

Following Anton's question, Polgast has no further of his own, looking back to Levelle who in turn thanks [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), ending her testimony. She sits back down.

## Witness: [Alistair Hawthorn](../../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md)

[Polgast Mouldylog](../../characters/polgast-mouldylog.md) tells [Itharmund Steeleye](../../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) to call his witnesses. He calls on [Alistair Hawthorn](../../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md).

Alistair is questioned for his side of the same story. He explains that a routine patrol on the edge of the [Hawkswood](../../places/forests/hawkswood.md) by his [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) spotted [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md) casting Produce Flame. Understanding this to be magic, they captured the firbolg following a struggle, and brought him into custody in [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md).

Asked about [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), Alistair explains that because of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) he had gone into [The Slippery Weasel](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md) to see the visitors for himself. He met [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) there and felt her trustworthy.

Once again [Patricia Wilbenotel](../../characters/patricia-wilbenotel.md) casts Zone of Truth, this time on Alistair. She retorts to his answer, demanding to know why his [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) were chasing [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) if she wasn't a threat. He explains that she was no trouble at first and in fact helped defend against a wolf attack, effectively fighting alongside her and offering her an unclaimed reward. Later he caught [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) looking at paperwork inside the [Goldreach Astornox Stronghold](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/goldreach-astornox-stronghold.md). When he caught him in the act he let slip that he had contact with the firbolg's daughter. This meant harbouring [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), so Alistair instructed his [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) to capture Wrenn's party.

[Anton Haverwick](../../characters/anton-haverwick.md) notes that Alistair failed to capture her. Alistair scrambles to defend himself, explaining that he attempted to get Wrenn to cooperate in laying a trap to capture the party, but he disappeared in the night. He then put all of his effort into capturing Wrenn, but he escaped in the night along with [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and the rest of the party.

[Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md) speaks up, playfully remarking that it sounds like Alistair is in a load of trouble. Alistair looks remorseful. Patricia lays the blame at his feet, emphasising that as Captain of [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) it was his duty to make sure that [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) don't escape, and that this isn't a good look on him. He solemnly apologises before sitting down.

## Witness: [Tonnol Grisham](../../characters/tonnol-grisham.md)

[Itharmund Steeleye](../../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) calls [Tonnol Grisham](../../characters/tonnol-grisham.md) to give evidence. He stands. Surprised by the inclusion of this witness, the generals ask who he is. He introduces himself as a [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md).

He makes it clear that he is giving testimony on what the party did while entering [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) to seek [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). He explains that his squad was watching over the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) when they became aware of the party attempting to bypass it via the sewers. One of his guards was found dead in the sewer, the cause of death and the perpetrator unknown. He makes his opinion known - that the guard was down there chasing the party, and that one of the party took their life.

[Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md) notes the seriousness of the accusation, one that she has already heard. She looks to the party, asking them to speak for themselves.

Thanea plays dumb, claiming there was nobody in the sewers, just them and the sewage. Saoirse backs her up, explaining that they only heard guards, urging them to continue running. [Patricia Wilbenotel](../../characters/patricia-wilbenotel.md) leans in intently, casting Mass Suggestion on the party, ordering them to stand up when giving evidence during this trial. Saoirse and [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) fail their wisdom saving throws, standing up as ordered. Thanea nervously stands up. Patricia then casts Zone of Truth, telling the party to know their place and to think very carefully about what they're saying here. Everyone fails their charisma saving throw.

Patricia doubles down on the questioning as the party dodged her question, pointedly asking if they were involved in the death of the guard in the sewers. Thanea says she wasn't. Saoirse says she doesn't know. Patricia exchanges looks with her peers before forcing the questioning  of Tonnol to end.

## Witness: [Kur Merkys](../../characters/kur-merkys.md)

Patricia's patience thinning, she asks [Itharmund Steeleye](../../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) if there are any more surprise witnesses. He calls his last, [Kur Merkys](../../characters/kur-merkys.md), who stands up.

Not wishing the waste any more time, Patricia casts Zone of Truth on Kur, who doesn't resist its effect.

He explains that he was present on [Kirrel](../../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street when the party killed an [Astornox guard](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md), pointing at Torbra.

*[Kur Merkys](../../characters/kur-merkys.md):*
> It was that one!

He goes on to explain that as [Astornox Magicborn Hunters](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md), he and [Vilnia Kovas](../../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) waited to ambush the party. When they made their move fighting erupted. When the guards surrounded them, the party struck first.

*[Kur Merkys](../../characters/kur-merkys.md):*
> And then the tabaxi they were with opened fire on Vilnia. And then those two, those two started attacking as well, and they KILLED HER!-

As Kur begins shouting, his voice stops in an instant, his body frozen in place. [Patricia Wilbenotel](../../characters/patricia-wilbenotel.md) has jumped forward onto the edge of the raised section behind which she is seated, arm and open palm thrust in Kur's direction. She sternly commands him to sit down, and he does without fail. It is clear that he was stopped and ordered through magical means.

[Anton Haverwick](../../characters/anton-haverwick.md) sternly reminds Itharmund that [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunters aren't afforded the same protections as [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md), something that isn't up for debate today. It is part of the job of being a [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter - their lives are forfeit (to [magicborn on the run](../../storylines/ended/magicborn-on-the-run.md)).

Itharmund, shaken by the aftermath of Kur's outburst, apologises profusely before sitting down.

[Patricia Wilbenotel](../../characters/patricia-wilbenotel.md) asks [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is she says anything in her defence. She says no, only commenting that Kur fell "like a sack of potatoes". After a dumbfounded look appears on her face, she tells Torbra that she meant the guard. Torbra claims to have had nothing to do with the guard's death, but fails to deceive Patricia who asks if Torbra would like to try again.

Remembering the specifics of the fight, Torbra describes the guard (once again) as having fallen "like a sack of potatoes", much to the disbelief of her party. [Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md) grins, remarking that the papers will have a field day with this. The other generals shoot her a dirty look.

## Witnesses: The Party

[Anton Haverwick](../../characters/anton-haverwick.md) changes the topic, noting that he understands that the party is in a difficult situation at the moment. He prompts them to present any redeeming qualities that the generals should be aware of.

Thanea explains that they got into this mess by trying to help an [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) ([Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md)). Torbra emphasises their distress factoring into their actions, having been chased across the kingdom by the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) before arriving at [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md).

Noting that the party is being hunted as [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), [Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md) asks the party point-blank if they are [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md). Torbra says that she doesn't think so. Thanea explains that after everything they've experienced, they've learned to keep things like that to themselves.

Liabella asks for demonstrations instead of answers:

| Character | Spell | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | N/A | Does not know who or what she is, refusing to demonstrate. |
| [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | Minor Illusion | An illusion of an ornate glass on the generals' desk appears in her hand. |
| [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | N/A | Remarks she is only good at swinging a halberd. |
| [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) | Druidcraft | A miniature sun showing the day's weather appears in her hand. |

Liabella is disappointed, calling the group frustrating. She remarks on her hopes that the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) would be able to put the group to use if they showed magical promise. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) draws attention to how complicit she has been despite her group's nervousness.

When Thanea asks what they'd like to see, Liabella, now quite far off-script, offers a perfectly good wall for them to do something to.

| Character | Spell | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | Eldritch Blast | Force hits the wall causing a large bang sound. An entire stone slab collapses to the ground. |
| [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | Magic Missile | Chipped stonework that falls to the floor. |
| [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) | Healing Word | Bangs her hed on the pew in front, spraying blood on [Rowan Great Sile](../../characters/rowan-great-sile.md) and causing [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) and [Mindira Flibfae](../../characters/mindira-flibfae.md) to leap out of the way. [Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md) and [Anton Haverwick](../../characters/anton-haverwick.md) stand in shock. The spell causes the running blood to fizzle away and the wound to close. |

*[Patricia Wilbenotel](../../characters/patricia-wilbenotel.md):*
> Well, I may be in my two hundred and fifties, but I've seen everything now.

Patricia asks Levelle if there's anything else they'd like to add. They take a large sigh and shoot [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) a dirty glance. Mindira is grinning like an idiot, loving the display. Levelle makes her case to the generals that the party have been swept up in others' affairs. The lives lost along the way were regrettable, but Levelle believes that the party will be useful to the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). They note that [magicborn on the run](../../storylines/ended/magicborn-on-the-run.md) making it to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) from somewhere as far away as [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) is rare and impressive, which should be taken into account.

Patricia asks [Itharmund Steeleye](../../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) to give his impression of the party.

He explains that the party is a danger. They killed multiple guards and have the ability to kill [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunters. At a minimum he needs them for the war effort, connecting to [Patricia Wilbenotel](../../characters/patricia-wilbenotel.md) ([Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) General of War) on this point specifically.

## Deliberating

After a moment of exchanging glances, [Polgast Mouldylog](../../characters/polgast-mouldylog.md) announces that the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) will take a slight break in which they will debate, returning with their verdict. All 5 of them exit the room through the door behind [Corville Thornox](../../characters/corville-thornox.md).

[Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) comes bounding up to [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), letting out an exasperated swear over her unhinged display of her magic. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) defends herself, saying she needed a wound to heal. Levelle continues to lay into her, suggesting that what she did was counter-productive to the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s efforts to paint the party as useful and helpful people of Astor. Levelle tells the rest of the party that they didn't appreciate the lying which won't do them any favours with the verdict.

Levelle takes a sigh and relaxes, hoping that the trial goes their way. They inform [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) that [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md) is still being held in Eaglesfield as the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) refused to bring him to [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) for the trial.

[Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) catches [Kur Merkys](../../characters/kur-merkys.md) staring right at her, uncaring that she has noticed this. She stares back. She chats with Saoirse about why it's her he's staring at, concluding that he probably holds her responsible for [Vilnia Kovas](../../characters/vilnia-kovas.md)' death. Neither of them feel bad for what they did as it was out of self defence. Thanea reckons they'll see him again. Saoirse hopes so as she wasn't finished. Saoirse loses a staring contest with Kur by winking.

## The Verdict

As the door opens, the room goes silent as the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) take their places again. For the first time it is the General Supreme, [Corville Thornox](../../characters/corville-thornox.md) who does the talking.

*[Corville Thornox](../../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> The verdict of today's trial is:
> 
> That firbolgs are people within the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). They are to be treated under the same laws and customs as the general citizenship.

There is immediately an uproar from the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) side of the room, and a sinking feeling in [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)'s stomach. The senior [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are looking at the party to gauge their reaction.

*[Corville Thornox](../../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> However, firbolgs who remain in their clans are under the jurisdiction of the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). By [Kirrel](../../gods/deities/kirrel.md)'s teachings they will be protected and afforded and the same level of protection as the forest itself.
> 
> To this end, [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md) will remain in the custody of the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).
>
> The four here before us today are charged with the deaths of two guards. [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) - for the death of a guard on [Kirrel](../../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street you are fined 4,000 gp, and the rest of the party are fined 4,000 gp for the death of a guard in the sewers.
>
> Beyond this, I extend to you a pardon. You are absolved of all other crimes on the basis that you join a military organisation of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md).

Now the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) side of the room erupts in uproar.

[Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) stands up.

*[Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md):*
> The [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), as a show of good faith, take responsibility for the actions of these four and will pay the 8,000 gp fine.

She turns around and smirks unhappily at the party.

*[Corville Thornox](../../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> As you wish. This concludes today's trial.

With that, [Corville Thornox](../../characters/corville-thornox.md) and the other generals leave through the door, signalling the end of the trial.

Levelle comes straight over to the party, still processing the verdict, declaring it a compromise of sorts. Thanea thanks them for paying the fine for them. Levelle explains that tensions between both organisations are high right now and that paying their fine should go some way towards reducing them.

[Itharmund Steeleye](../../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) comes over to Levelle, offering his hand for a handshake, saying "well played". He remarks that both sides got some of what they wanted. There is clearly a lack of tension following the verdict.

*[Itharmund Steeleye](../../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md):*
> Let's call this one a draw.

Levelle accepts Itharmund's handshake, not saying anything to him but being civil. He then goes back to his fellow [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). Once he leaves, Levelle brings up that the party is now looking for a military position. Saoirse mentions that the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) seemed interested in having them aboard, though [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) is sceptical. Levelle suggests that an offers must be made in order for them to join *any* of the military organisations.

## Job Offers

### [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md)

[Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) is the first to make the party an offer. They offer to bring all four of them aboard as a new [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad. They mention that [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) has told them many interesting things that would be worth having them work on, alluding to [the meteoric threat](../../storylines/the-meteoric-threat.md). They explain that the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have separate jurisdiction to the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), and that they would be paid per mission (20-200 gp) for their efforts. Levelle makes a specific point of saying that the party shouldn't feel that they owe the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) for having paid their fine, instead asking them to make an informed decision and do what's right for them.

Saoirse and Thanea are keen to see what other offers they get before they accept anything.

Levelle explains that [Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md) is the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) General of Culture and is most likely interested in the cultural impact of today's trial, particularly the party's story and how it may shape public perceptions of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) as a whole from within.

### [Astornos](../../organisations/astornos.md)

At this exact moment Torbra hears a voice in her head that she doesn't recognise. It tells her that it has an offer for the party that will take them outside of the kingdom. She should ask for wine if she wishes to accept.

After [Reeds in the Desert Oasis](../../characters/reeds-in-the-desert-oasis.md) leaves, the voice once again contacts Torbra. It explains that the offer will have them working for the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), but outside of the kingdom. When Torbra asks who they are, it takes 5 minutes for a different voice to reply. It tells her that it cannot say unless she accepts. To accept she must go to [Diamond Prime](../../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md) and enter through the [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) door.

### [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md)

[Reeds in the Desert Oasis](../../characters/reeds-in-the-desert-oasis.md) comes over to the party from the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) pews, causing Levelle to dip out. She commends the party on escaping the worst of the trial's potential outcomes before presenting an offer to become [Astornox Magicborn Hunters](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md).

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) is immediately a hard no. When she mentions being allowed to be murdered in the street, Reeds corrects her, explaining that it only applies to [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), and the rule is there to give them a fair and fighting chance.

Reeds explains that their offer is the quickest route to citizenship (6mo - 1yr), and that the job pays exceptionally well. They are very keen to recruit the party as their killing of [Vilnia Kovas](../../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) shows that they are in need of better talent. Reeds harbours no ill will towards the party and assures them that other [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) would suffer severe punishments if they tried to hurt one of their own. The work is largely self-driven, with payment on successful apprehensions (500-10,000 gp). She illustrates the high payout by telling the party that Kur and Vilnia would have been paid 
8,000 gp for the party's capture.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) mentions that nobody has offered to get her father released yet. Reeds offers to pull some strings if the party joins the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), but [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) doesn't buy it despite Reeds being truthful.

Once again the party declines to make a decision now. Reeds explains that they can contact her by asking for her by name at the [Northhaven Astornox Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astornox-stronghold.md).

## Time to Leave

[Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) approaches the group and indicates that it's time to leave. The party, Mergin, Levelle and Mindira head to the teleportation circle. He once again teleports the group, arriving back in their [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) room in [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md).

The party is ushered out of [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) and onto the street of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md). They gather up their possessions along the way, including their old clothes, handing back their [Astorrel robes](../../organisations/astorrel/uniforms/astorrel-robes.md).

[Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) escorts the party to The Missions End, checking them in at the small table to the left hand side of the door. The [Astorrel Member](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) working the door is surprised to see the [Astorrel Commandant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md), but diligently takes her money and accepts her order to put the party up for one night only, after which they are to be escorted out of the stronghold. Levelle explains the purpose of the building and how it works, before explaining that they can be found in the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md) if the party wishes to accept the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s offer. They also help point them towards the [Northhaven Astornox Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astornox-stronghold.md) if they wish to accept their offer.
