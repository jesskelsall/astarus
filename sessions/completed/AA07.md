*This session was originally cancelled and reconvened as a meeting to handle the transition from [Brooke](../../players/brooke.md) ([Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md)) to [Chloe](../../players/chloe.md) ([Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md)). All players then agreed to a short role play that introduced Noon to [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md), though this ended up snowballing into a full length session.*

## Meeting Noon

It is three days before the [Nature's Battle 28](../../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md) tournament is due to start. [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) are enjoying some downtime in [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) when [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md), and [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) are summoned to [Bryce Morton's office](../../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md). [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md) calls them inside when they arrive and knock.

Inside they find [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) sat on Bryce's couch, conversing with him. He has one leg crossed over the other and is speaking charismatically, as if they are good friends despite them having just met. Bryce seems captivated by Noon's charms. Next to him on the couch is a tome.

Noon turns to face the party as they enter, leaning back in his chair and greeting them with a warm smile. Bryce stands so as to not be the only person in the room sitting.

Ahsha asks where [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) is. Bryce explains that there was a need for a squad reshuffle - Whisper is transferring out of [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) into [Dolphin squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/dolphin-squad.md) and Noon is replacing them. The party recognises Noon from their [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) training, though they've never spoken to him before.

The others welcome him to the squad, to which Noon thanks them graciously. Ahsha asks if Noon is a fighter or a magic user. Noon describes himself as a [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), prompting Ephaine to describe herself similarly.

Before introductions can proceed further Bryce speaks up, wanting to finish speaking to the squad before he goes back to reading his book. He explains that Noon received the exceptional training bonus (like Ahsha) and will be part of their [Nature's Battle](../../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) tournament squad. He advises they take the next few days to get to know each other.

Redwyn asks about their next mission, which Whisper would have been acting [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) on. Bryce explains that due to their participation in the tournament their next mission is on hold, and the details will be figured out on their return from it. Bryce tells them to assemble at sunrise outside of the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md) in three days so they can be taken to [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md).

Bryce goes back to reading his book, shooting a glance at the party that suggests they should leave now.

## Getting to Know Each Other

The party agrees to go back to [the Rose Buckler](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) and grab a table so they can chat and get to know each other better. They leave the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) through the gatehouse, Ephaine noticing a still wary guard presence but no sign of [Kur Merkys](../../characters/kur-merkys.md) watching from a rooftop.

Making their way inside the inn, Noon is met with a typically rustic tavern exterior. Its manufactured appearance is lost on him, him fully believing that this place is as run of the mill as it looks. When Ephaine asks if he has been in before he admits he hasn't, finding it quaint.

Noon offers to buy everyone drinks while they find a table. At the bar he gets [Tydrus Tinshield](../../characters/tydrus-tinshield.md)'s attention who engages in enthusiastic conversation over a new patron. Noon orders four of their finest ales, Tydrus pulling four Fox Tail Brewery Blood Moons for him, asking for 4 sp. Noon stifles a smile, dropping 1 pp on the bar, telling Tydrus to keep the change. He breaks down in disbelief, insisting that the coin is used to open a tab and pay for whatever they need.

Noon carries the drinks back to the table using a tray on the bar. He catches the foot of a walking patron, tipping the tray forward toward the squad's table. Ahsha manages to grab two ales, Ephaine a single ale, and Redwyn instinctively dives across the table to get a hand on the fourth which loses a slight amount of its liquid on her hand. Noon is shaken but regains his composure, playing it off as no big deal.

The party is thankful for Noon's generosity. He finds it no big deal, trying his best to make a strong first impression. Ahsha and Redwyn conclude their conversation, Ahsha sliding 8 gp over to Redwyn (preparing for more gambling gains at [the Rat's Nest](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rats-nest.md)'s pit fighting ring later).

Ahsha asks if Noon knows of the squad's precious escapades but Noon reveals that [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md) didn't tell him much. The party finds out from Noon that he transferred in from [Dolphin Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/dolphin-squad.md) (where [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) has been moved to). He alludes to their first mission not going well, causing the transfer to happen. Ephaine mentions their exploits in [Arnaside](../../places/villages/arnaside.md) before asking if Noon is familiar with or from the area. Noon tells the party that he is from [Kardanis](../../places/regions/kardanis.md). Ephaine shares that she is from Filisur. Ahsha gives a run down of their last mission ([Check Logging in Arnaside](../../storylines/ended/check-logging-in-arnaside.md)), not sparing the details of the [blue kobolds](../../lineages/blue-kobold.md) they encountered there.

Cheers go up from the back of the inn as a rowdy bunch revel in an exciting game of [Twenties](../../mechanics/roleplay/games/twenties.md). Ephaine sees [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) playing, including [Jaxon Ultari](../../characters/jaxon-ultari.md) who she recognises from when [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) last played [Twenties](../../mechanics/roleplay/games/twenties.md) in here. Ephaine shoots them a glance and they go back to their game.

## More Pit Fighting

[Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) reveals her plan with Redwyn to return to [the Rat's Nest](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rats-nest.md) over the next two nights to fight again and earn some coin through gambling, Redwyn placing bets on Ahsha. She invites Ephaine and Noon to join them if they wish. A random bar patron comes over to Ahsha, putting a hand on her shoulder and advising her to keep quiet about the fighting pit, alluding to its secretive nature. She hadn't realised that their private conversation could be listened in on. 

Noon tells Ahsha that he is in. Ephaine expresses an interest but points out her lack of money, noting her 3 gp debt to Ahsha. Noon passes a platinum coin to Redwyn to aid with her betting. Redwyn is confused by the high denomination coin, Noon looking equally confused at someone not knowing how to handle platinum coins, revealing Noon's aristocratic background and means.

The following night they head back to [the Rat's Nest](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rats-nest.md), Ahsha fighting while Redwyn places bets on her. Each bet made is a "double or nothing" wager. Redwyn and [Vorrick Pumpitibeg](../../characters/vorrick-pumpitibeg.md) provide healing. After the first round Redwyn secretly casts Bardic Inspiration on Ahsha to help her out.

| Fight Difficulty | Wager | Ability Check | Fight Outcome | Takings |
| --- | ---:|:---:| --- | ---:|
| Medium | 20 gp | STR | Loss | - 20 gp |
| Medium | 20 gp | DEX | Win | + 20 gp |
| Medium | 35 gp | STR | Win | + 35 gp |

Ahsha asks Vorrick if there is a way to become a regular challenger. He tells her that all she needs to do is keep coming back and challenging others, as long as she keeps quiet about the pit fighting ring. It becomes clear that the folks that dwell in the hidden bar are warming up to her.

*[Long rest]*

## A Chance Encounter with Ludolf

The following day [Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) are walking through the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md). [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) spots [Ludolf Hornwallis](../../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md) walking the other way and stops to chat with him. He explains that he is training a group of [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) that sought [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) and have been granted [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) membership. His mention of a blue firbolg ([Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)) rings a bell to Ephaine through various town crier messages as of late.

He explains that their case went to a trial ([Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) trial), a concept that doesn't really mean anything to the party, Ludolf giving a sense that the matter was important. He gives a brief highlight of [the firbolg controversy](../../storylines/ended/the-firbolg-controversy.md) and the outcome of the trial. Ephaine asks if they are [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) like her, to which Ludolf explains that they are a mixed bag.

Ludolf tells Ephaine that he believes that training this group is his last chance of earning a promotion before he retires. Ephaine is remorseful, feeling that she may have held him back while he trained her, but he dismisses the notion immediately. Ludolf tells the party that the [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) seekers graduated into the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) last night. When Ephaine points out how quickly that process has happened, Ludolf suggests that a special exception has been made for them.

Ludolf congratulates the party for their invite to [Nature's Battle 28](../../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md). Ephaine introduces [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) to him. Noon is courteous and proper with his introduction.

After catching up, Ludolf asks [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) if they need a space to practice ahead of the tournament, flashing a wrought iron key in front of them. They are keen for an opportunity to practice their magic where it is welcome, taking him up on the offer. It is clear that he shouldn't really be letting them into the [Northhaven Astorrel Arena](../../places/buildings/northhaven-astorrel-arena.md) but can keep their business quiet.

The party is lead into the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md) as guests of Ludolf and into the tunnels below the stronghold, snaking their way through corridors before arriving at a metal door. He opens it, revealing the cavernous arena space which he illuminates by casting Dancing Lights.

## Sparring with Each Other?

It becomes clear to the party that there is no one to fight except each other. [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) recoils at the thought of pointing her magic at her squad mates, [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) sharing her sentiment. Ephaine asks [Ludolf Hornwallis](../../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md) if there are any magical safeguards in place to keep them safe. Ludolf informs the party that there is no such thing - it is an empty room only.

Ephaine recalls her training which involved casting destructive spells at trees and rocks. Only recently has she cast them at creatures, and she has had difficulty in controlling its potency.

## Sparring with Creatures

Ludolf sees the party debating what to do and offers them help. He explains that he has access to other [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) who may be able to help give them something to fight, and that he used their abilities yesterday with [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md). He leaves the party alone in the arena while he goes to find if they are available and willing.

Ludolf returns with four robed [Astorrel members](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md). He converses with them briefly before opening up the large gate on the other side of the room, the others following him. Ephaine notices a flashes of light inside the room beyond (as they cast True Polymorph on the boulders within to transform them into large creatures). Ludolf and the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) cross the room to the raised platform, telling the party to pick starting positions in the room.

[Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) takes a forward position in the middle of the room, with [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) on one side and [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) on the other. Ephaine casts Bless on the others.

Banging can be heard on the re-sealed door on the far side of the room. An [Astorrel member](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) casts Misty Step over to the door, unhooks the large bar keeping the door shut, then Misty Steps back. The door swings open as two tigers and a giant spider emerge.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Both tigers charge out of the gate, one each rushing up to [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md). The spider emerges while climbing up the wall. It fires a blob of web at Ahsha, sticking her to the floor, restraining her.

Ephaine activates Starry Form: Archer and moves forward to hit the spider with her form's archer attack and a cast of Guiding Bolt, wounding it significantly. Noon casts Eldritch Blast at the spider, finishing it off. It releases its grip from the wall as it dies, transforming back into a large rock as it falls. It thuds to the ground, the impact reverberating around the room, revealing the true nature of these creatures.

Redwyn casts Vicious Mockery on the tiger in front of her but the tiger shrugs her magic off. She casts Bardic Inspiration on Ephaine. Ahsha breaks free of the spider web with her brute strength.

A giant scorpion emerges from the darkness of the far room, catching the party off guard. It wastes no time charging up to Ahsha. Both tigers take bites at Ahsha and Redwyn but both are able to dodge their advances. Ephaine casts Interstellar Medium (Frostbite) at the giant scorpion, frosting it over and making it harder for it to move. As she hits it with another archer attack it becomes clear that it is unfazed by her efforts.

[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) casts Witch Bolt at the tiger attacking Ahsha, a burst of lightning emitting from his hand. Ephaine sees this and doesn't feel as alone in the world any more. The attack lands well, beginning to bombard the tiger as she maintains her concentration on the spell. Redwyn casts Vicious Mockery on her tiger, failing once again.

Ahsha turns her attention to the giant scorpion, striking it critically with her greataxe, bisecting its chitinous carapace in one place, squelching its fleshy innards and doing it real damage. It retaliates with its pincers, both of which miss, but its stinger plunges down into her. She resists the bulk of the poison as it courses through her veins. The tiger next to her fails to get a bite in while the scorpion attacks. Ephaine throws archer attacks and Guiding Bolt at the scorpion, helping to wear it down further.

Noon continues to channel his Witch Bolt into the tiger, almost finishing it off. Redwyn gets frustrated and casts Blindness on the tiger in front of her but it resists. Neither have managed to injure the other, the pair locked in a stalemate.

Ahsha spots an opening on the giant scorpion, hitting it along a fault line opening up on its carapace. As the last of its life leaves it the scorpion transforms back into a giant boulder. She dives out of the way but gets hit in the face by the moving boulder, knocking her back slightly.

The tigers continue their bite attacks. Ahsha is bitten, Redwyn is not. Ephaine turns her attention to Redwyn's tiger, casting Guiding Bolt on it, weakening it noticeably. Redwyn takes a step back and takes a claw attack from it before loosing an arrow into it from her bow. Noon continues to channel Witch Bolt into Ahsha's tiger, the smell of acrid burning hair becoming noticeable.

Ahsha hacks at her tiger, finishing it off, turning it back into a rock. She is able to dive back as it transforms, avoiding it hitting her as it rolls momentarily. The other tiger charges at Redwyn, pouncing on her, slashing her as it goes. Ephaine throws Starry Form and Starry Form: Archer at it, piercing its body as the tiger turns back into a boulder. It rolls toward Redwyn and pinches her against the ground before she pulls out from under it.

*[Initiative order ends]*

[Ludolf Hornwallis](../../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md) and the robed [Astorrel members](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) begin to clap as combat ends. Ephaine drops her Starry Form. Noon congratulates Ahsha on a job well done, checking on her well being. When Ahsha asks if he can heal her, Noon reveals that he possesses no form of healing magic. Ephaine heals Ahsha before going quiet, closing her eyes.

Ludolf runs down the stairs and joins the party as they begin to congregate. He casts Mass Healing Word to assist them. He reassures Ephaine that she did well, to which she responds that [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) is a capable group of people. While Ludolf is impressed with what he saw from them, he mentions that the "group of [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) seekers" ([Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)) finished this challenge faster.

*[Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> Speed isn't everything.

The [Astorrel members](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) congregate around [Ludolf Hornwallis](../../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md) and converse with him quietly, the group discussing their Mass Polymorph technique, using this opportunity as further training for their magic. Ephaine realises that they are [Astorrel Lieutenants](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-lieutenant.md), causing Ephaine to straighten up. One by one they make their way over to the boulders, casting True Polymorph on them again, turning them into small spiders that make their way back into the room on the far side. They are transformed back into boulders and the door is closed by magical means. Ludolf apologises for the unconventional fight, noting that he and the [Astorrel Lieutenants](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-lieutenant.md) have been working on this training exercise for a while now.

He tells Ephaine the story of when he participated in the [Nature's Battle](../../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) tournament many years ago. He was only able to play one match before the tournament was called off. When Ahsha tries to ask what happened, Ludolf goes silent, drifting off in painful thoughts (the death of a competitor during his match). He implores Ephaine to be careful, telling her that the tournaments are a lot safer than they used to be.

[Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) leave the tunnels, back through the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md). The [Astorrel Lieutenants](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-lieutenant.md) disappear into the tunnel network, somewhere else to be. [Ludolf Hornwallis](../../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md) parts way, wishing the party luck in the tournament. He tells Ephaine that he will be going to bed early as he departs for [Dunmore](../../places/cities/dunmore.md) in the morning.

That night [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) retires to bed early, the day's combat and her lack of magical control playing heavily on her mind.

## Remaining Downtime

With their remaining downtime some errands are taken care of. [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) and [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) take the opportunity to browse and purchase weapons at [Rhotrukk Wepons](../../places/buildings/shops/rhotrukk-wepons.md).

Noon peruses the store, picking up several weapons with a disgusted look, silently unhappy with their quality, perceiving them as vastly inferior to the [Schiller Steel](../../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) he is accustomed to.

| Character | Item | Price |
| --- | --- | ---:|
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | Shortsword | - 10 gp |

Noon continues staying at [Valley Under the Stars](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/valley-under-the-stars.md) for the remainder of his downtime.

*[2 days later]*

## Heading to [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md)

The day of the start of the tournament quickly comes round. Early that morning [Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) (minus Noon) gather up in [the Rose Buckler](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) and head out. [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) is slow to emerge and is incredibly nervous, apologising profusely for being late. The squad meets [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) on the way to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

The stronghold's street is quiet as they walk up it. At its end outside of [Kirrel Hall](../../places/buildings/kirrel-hall.md) and the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md) they are greeted with a collection of [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), here to see them off. They notice [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md), [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md), and [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md) waiting outside of the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md).

[Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) greets them, passing good wishes to them via everyone else assembled here. Noon plays up to the formalities, declaring the opportunity to participate an honour.

*[Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md):*
> Spoken like a true Schiller.

[Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) notice another group of people running up the street. As they emerge into the small square they recognise them as [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md). [Penance Zahiri](../../characters/penance-zahiri.md) runs over to the party and greets them excitedly.

*[Penance Zahiri](../../characters/penance-zahiri.md):*
> Ah [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) we meet again. This is going to be fun!

Penance is excited by the possibility of battling [Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md). [Morgan Caithness](../../characters/morgan-caithness.md) dismisses the notion, not bothered by who they fight as long as they win.

Ephaine asks about the new [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad that were invited to the tournament ([Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)). Penance is aware of the tall blue firbolg ([Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)), sharing the basic gossip that they know. [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) flusters [Darius Dunn](../../characters/darius-dunn.md) who stammers out a statement of intent, hoping that [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) are knocked out before [Ruby squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) have to fight them. Ahsha nudges Redwyn with her elbow, finding the moment cute. [Tabari Se](../../characters/tabari-se.md) remains silent throughout.


Levelle wishes that the competitiveness exhibited by both squads translates into the arena. They usher [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) to step forward. Ephaine, Noon, and Redwyn notice a teleportation circle drawn onto the floor of the square that Mergin moves to the center of. [Ruby squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) are encouraged to join him in [the circle](../../places/buildings/the-circle.md). He casts Teleportation Circle by tapping his staff against the stones beneath him, causing him and the squad to vanish without any additional sound or sight, disappearing in an instant. After several minutes he reappears alone. He beckons [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) forward - it is now their turn.

As the crowd in the square waves them off, [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) looks back down the road leading out of the stronghold, seeing a group of four ([Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)) making their way up the road. She notices a tall blue figure ([Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)) at the very moment that Mergin casts the spell again. In an instant they vanish from the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).
