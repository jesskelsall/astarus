## Continuing to [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md)

### 07:00

The following morning, the party set back off down the [River Humar](../../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), heading for [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md). [Sarleen Truestriker](../../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md) is keen to press on. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) asks Sarleen about whether to expect [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md), to which Sarleen informs them that there will be some present.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) questions why everyone is so interested in the party - whether it's because they're [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), or if there is more to it. Sarleen believes that it is likely a combination of that and [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md)'s message.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) forages while the group packs up the camp. This provides the day's food and water for the party. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) is slightly annoyed to learn that [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) can do this, having bought a load of rations in [Frizthwaite](../../places/villages/frizthwaite.md). It takes [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) 2 hours to return, delaying their departure.

### 09:00

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) asks about using their boat rather than dragging it along with her. Sarleen cautions against the approach due to its size and the party's weight. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) decides to continue dragging it along with them.

The day's travel towards [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md) is uneventful.

### 17:00

After a full day's travel, [Sarleen Truestriker](../../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md) is aware that the party is not far from [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md). Faced with the decision to either camp overnight and rest, or push on and risk exhaustion, the group decides to set up camp early, allowing them to make an early start the following day.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) throws the boat to the ground, narrowly avoiding [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md).

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) try spear fishing in the river with the spears they took from the gnolls. One spear is lost down river, the second is saved, having been tied to a rope. No fish are caught. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) instead forages for food.

### 19:00

The party settles down and goes to bed.

| Character | Shift | Observations
| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) | 4h | Logs floating down river. |
| [Sarleen Truestriker](../../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md) | 4h | Bats in the sky. |

*[Long rest]*

### 06:00

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) asks Sarleen if she thinks that the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) would have any use for their boat. Unsure, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) moves the boat into some bushes along the river's edge, trying her best to hide it. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) aids her effort, casting Mould Earth to try and hide it in the dirt. She partially succeeds, making it harder to pull the boat out. It remains visible.

### 07:00

The party sets back out for [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md), Sarleen confident that they're only a few hours from the village.

On the way, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) thinks she sees a badger and chases after it. It's an opossum rather than a badger. She pets it anyway.

## Entering [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md)

The party comes across [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md). On their way in, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) casts Disguise Self to turn into a middle-aged human female.

Sarleen leads the party down its main street where she knows the [Ulburn Astorrel House](../../places/buildings/ulburn-astorrel-house.md) to be. It is on the right hand side of the main road (looking down towards the [River Humar](../../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md)), with Humar's Knee (inn) several buildings closer on the same side.

Sarleen sees several figures outside of the inn that look like [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). Trying to avoid them, she leads the party into one of the side streets. They all proceed stealthily, avoiding one guards walking up the street. Emerging further down the street beyond the [Ulburn Astorrel House](../../places/buildings/ulburn-astorrel-house.md). Looking up the street, they see the house now on the left side of the street from their perspective.

## [Ulburn Astorrel House](../../places/buildings/ulburn-astorrel-house.md)

Sarleen knocks on the locked door of [Ulburn Astorrel House](../../places/buildings/ulburn-astorrel-house.md). After a moment, [Louise Perkins](../../characters/louise-perkins.md) opens the door, recognises Sarleen and ushers her inside. Seeing the party, she questions Sarleen momentarily before Sarleen ensures her that they're fine to enter with her.

The party enters into the main room while Louise heads upstairs. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) questions Sarleen about what the building is used for. Sarleen explains that [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) both lives and works here at the moment.

Louise returns downstairs and heads into the kitchen to tend to the food which is cooking. [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) emerges from the stairs, coming to meet Sarleen and the party.

Hidaar congratulates Sarleen for finding the party before introducing themselves. The party remarks that his name is not an easy one to say. They explain that Hidaar is his name while Darjonkaargeac is his clan name, worn first as a badge of honour.

Hidaar informs the party that they was contacted by [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md), making note that they assumes the party are aware of him. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) attempts to feign ignorance, but Hidaar sees through this. Sarleen expresses her disappointment in [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md).

They go on to explain that Wrenn sent him a message (Sending spell) after getting into trouble. They ask the party why they are on the run. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) mentions that it involves trouble with [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md). [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), still disguised, explains that Wrenn helped [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) learn that the [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) captured her father and that he is being moved to [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md).

Hidaar is confused by the lack of a blue firbolg amongst the group, noting the presence of [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) the grey human. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) attempts to lie that they lost them along the way, but Sarleen steps in, explaining that the disguised [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) is the blue firbolg. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) drops her disguise.

## Talking in Private

After looking at [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) for a moment, Hidaar asks Sarleen and Louise to leave the room. They both make their way upstairs.

Once they are both out of earshot, Hidaar is more upfront with what they know about Wrenn's message. He explains that Wrenn sent them a mental message after being captured by bandits ([The Crimson Blades](../../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md)). In it he pleads for Hidaar to save his friends who are being hunted by the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), and that they know information that will save the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md).

The party is confused by this last part. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) speculates that either Wrenn is bullshitting, or he is referencing the [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor that [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) is carrying attached to her belt. Nobody offers more information, and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) doesn't produce "the orb".

Hidaar accepts that whatever they know is beyond them. They continue to relay Wrenn's message: that he was captured near [Frizthwaite](../../places/villages/frizthwaite.md), are heading to [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md), and that there is a blue firbolg and grey human. They ask why the party is running. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) explains that they have been branded by the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) as [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md). Hidaar asks the group if they are [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md).

| Character | [Magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md)? (Hidaar's Perspective) |
| --- | --- |
| [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) | Unknown - Detects lie but remains unsure. |
| [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) | Yes - Sees Disguise Self spell drop, and casts Produce Flame when asked. |

With [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) unwilling to divulge details, Hidaar relents, understanding that the party must have been through enough already.

They ask the party what Sarleen has told them about the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) explains that she knows them to be more chill than the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) provides a more in depth explanation from her historical knowledge. Hidaar explains that the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) in [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md) are overseeing the growth of the village as it tries to become a town. DDarjonkaargeac Hidaar is the [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) lead, and together they work with [Spoor Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/spoor-squad.md). [Sarleen Truestriker](../../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md) is part of [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md).

Hidaar speculates that [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) likely contacted them because they've worked together in the past, and knowing that [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) is located in [Ulburn](../../places/villages/ulburn.md), would be best placed to try and help. The party explains that the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are hunting them, to which Hidaar remarks that it is as they feared. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) comments that hunting appears to be all that the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) do, but Hidaar is more balanced, retorting that they have their orders.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) asks who gave the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) their order to hunt down [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md). Hidaar offers a history lesson: General Supreme [Corville Thornox](../../characters/corville-thornox.md) ordered it so during the Astor-Syntenne War, and that since the armistice, the order has remained in place.

Hidaar, now knowing that [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) is the firbolg, asks again about their father. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) once again explains how her father was captured from their home by the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), and is being moved to [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) by cart. Hidaar tries to explain why a firbolg being captured by the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) may be a problem: [the firbolg controversy](../../storylines/ended/the-firbolg-controversy.md). They tell [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) that they believe strongly that firbolg should be left to their own devices in the forest, so they are willing to do whatever they can to try and help [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and her father's plight - particularly getting into [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md).

*[Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md):*

> I think there is a day of reckoning coming, and you will be integral to that.

Torbra asks what the plan is. Hidaar explains that getting into the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) would allow the party to seek [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). The [Astorrel guards](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) at the gatehouse may allow them to enter, though Hidaar expresses that the event may be scandalous if a firbolg on the run from the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) is granted [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). This in turn may trigger a trial to resolve [the firbolg controversy](../../storylines/ended/the-firbolg-controversy.md).

Hidaar gives an explanation of the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md): their role as the ruling organisation that oversees the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), and how they resolve major differences between both organisations through a trial process.

Hidaar calls Sarleen back downstairs.

## Sarleen Says Goodbye

As soon as [Sarleen Truestriker](../../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md) returns downstairs, [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) explains that he has a job for her. They unpin their [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) badge and give it to her, before instructing her to find [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) at the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md) and explain to them everything that is going on. They implore her to leave at once as time is of the essence.

Sarleen steps past the party, who wave her goodbye. She opens the front door, steps into the street, looks back at the party, then closes the door behind her, heading for [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) at haste.

## Business Before Dinner

Hidaar wraps up conversations for now, encouraging the party to relax for a while, safe in the knowledge that the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) aren't allowed to enter this building. Food will be ready soon.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and Torbra try to convince Hidaar to buy their boat. The whole party do their best to convince Hidaar to buy it. They tell the party that they have need of another boat, as [Spoor Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/spoor-squad.md) is spending a lot of time on the other side of the [River Humar](../../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) and it's getting inconvenient. Hidaar gets Louise to fetch 20 gp for the party. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) tries and fails to negotiate a higher price, with Hidaar explaining that their budget is stretched thin. When [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) asks for 20 gp now and more later, Hidaar glumly tells [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) that they're unlikely to meet again, depending on how their journey into [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) goes. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) asks if Hidaar can throw something else in. They throw in their personal shield. Hidaar is happy to pay in advance based on [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md)'s description of where the boat is, noting that another member of [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) will retrieve the boat upon their return.

Hidaar mentions that although the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) have no right to enter this building, if the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) Hunters come looking for them, their hands may be tied. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) tells Hidaar that the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) they've encountered so far haven't been very clever and were easily avoided.

Hidaar makes their way over to the other side of the room, pulling their copy of the [Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../../papers/maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md) from a side unit's drawer and unrolling it on the war table. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) puts Wrenn's [Meteoric Map of Astor](../../papers/maps/meteoric-map-of-astor.md) next to it. The party spend some time comparing the two maps while [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) amends Wrenn's map, making notes about what is near to the blue crosses on it.

## Sparrow Arrives

The party spend the rest of the day here, resting and relaxing while waiting for another member of [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) to show up.

### 16:00

There is knock at the door. Louise answers it, letting in [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md). They walk over to [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) and announce their return. Hidaar explains that Sarleen was successful, and introduces the party to them.

On closer inspection, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) notices a wasp buzzing around their person. Sparrow notices [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) staring before smirking, lifting their robe, and revealing 200 or so wasps buzzing around their person, a wasp's nest on their person. The party is visibly disturbed by this.

Hidaar explains to Sparrow that the party is trying to make their way into [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md), and that they are tasked with escorting them to [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md). Once they are fed, they should make a plan. Sparrow gladly accepts.

Sparrow tells the party that getting into [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) won't be easy, asking them how stealthy they all are. Torbra admits that she's not very due to her armour, Sparrow agreeing. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) hides behind [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), garnering a slow clap from Sparrow. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) uses Wild Shape into a cat. Sparrow laughs while [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) picks [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) up. They try to pet [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) with consent, but when none comes, they pull away.

### 16:30

[Louise Perkins](../../characters/louise-perkins.md) serves a large joint of pork, roast potatoes and root vegetables, with ale and a bottle of wine set on the table. Hidaar thanks [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) for the blessing of food before encouraging everyone to tuck in. Hidaar, Sparrow and Louise eat with the party, seemingly nobody else in the house currently.

After dinner, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) asks Hidaar for a conversation alone. They usher [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) upstairs into the corridor. Here [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) asks Hidaar if they're familiar with people having dreams that become reality. Hidaar isn't, but mentions that someone in Wrenn's squad, [Astral Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), may have something a bit like that. With that, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) shuts down the conversation, the pair heading back downstairs.

## Planning the [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) Approach

Hidaar tells Sparrow that it is a priority to get the party into the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) as soon as possible. Sparrow expresses concern about getting the [Astorrel guards](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) on the gatehouse to let them in, but that it is a problem for later.

Sparrow tells the party that they need to get into the [Sunset District](../../places/districts/sunset-district.md) through the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md). Normally this requires a military badge to be shown to prove their citizenship, pointing at their own [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) badge pinned to their robe.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) asks how they might be able to get their own badge. Sparrow tells them that it isn't easy - it took them 3 years to get their own. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) asks why you would want to join the military, to which Sparrow explains that becoming a citizen has its perks: they are not accountable to the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), they can own land and business. They make it clear that the reason they are [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) is because they like the work. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) asks further about being "above the law". Sparrow describes how [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) are not accountable to the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), though they can't totally do as they please.

Appraising the party's stealth capabilities, Sparrow comments on Torbra's armour, suggesting that she consider leaving it behind. Hidaar concurs, explaining that it may be a one-way trip if they are seen. Torbra retorts that it may be a one-way trip anyway.

Torbra is wary of the guarantees of safety being offered by Hidaar and the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Hidaar dismisses this, impressing upon the party that there is no more dangerous place to go as wanted [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), the irony being that in order to be safe, they must put themselves in danger.
