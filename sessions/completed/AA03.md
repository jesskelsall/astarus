## At [Humouth](../../places/villages/humouth.md)

The party wakes up the following day in [The Keeper's Reprise](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-keepers-reprise.md) in [Humouth](../../places/villages/humouth.md). Eager to get back on the road, they opt for an early start. [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) knocks on each room door, waking everyone up. [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) is last to wake.

[Clay Mullen](../../characters/clay-mullen.md) comes down the stairs, still looking worse for wear. He expresses his concern at proceeding further after the bandit attack, confessing that he is considering heading back to [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) so he can get some rest. [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) convinces Clay to stick with them.

The group head back onto The [Coastal Trail](../../places/roads/coastal-trail.md) towards [Allonby](../../places/villages/allonby.md). The morning's strong winds subside as the day goes on.

## At [Allonby](../../places/villages/allonby.md)

By early evening the coach arrives near [Allonby](../../places/villages/allonby.md). Clay stops the coach, to the initial concern of the group. He announces that they've arrived, and will be staying here for the night.

Clay gets to work unhitching his horse and conversing with the locals who are out in their fields, picking ripe root vegetables from the land. Before long he's enlisted the help of other villagers who aid him in removing the wheels from his coach and taking them into the village. This ensures that the coach doesn't roll away during high winds that may occur overnight. He takes his horse into the village where he will stay.

As the group proceed into [Allonby](../../places/villages/allonby.md), they find themselves welcomed openly by the villagers who are happy and curious to meet new people. There are many eyes on them as they make their way into the village courtyard.

Meanwhile, Redwyn and [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) make their way towards a path down into the land that they've seen locals coming and going from. There's no sign of a village, but they must be going somewhere. They follow the path down into one of [Allonby](../../places/villages/allonby.md)'s gullies, eventually emerging in the central area. Here they observe the locals doing their daily business, as well as 3 [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) on the opposite side of the courtyard, beyond the well.

Redwyn makes her way over to the guards. She meets [Roygol Mortisen](../../characters/roygol-mortisen.md), [Astornox Guard Corporal](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-corporal.md), and 2 new [Astornox Guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) that he is showing the ropes. Roygol informs Redwyn, and then later Ahsha:

- Their patrol route from [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md), through [Humouth](../../places/villages/humouth.md), as far as [Allonby](../../places/villages/allonby.md), then back.
- They don't go to [Arnaside](../../places/villages/arnaside.md) as the locals refuse their help, making the 2 day round trip pointless.
- Bandits have been known to frequent the [Coastal Trail](../../places/roads/coastal-trail.md), though sightings are rare. This is likely due to the low [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) presence here.
- Roygol is thankful that the party defeated the bandits they encountered between [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) and [Humouth](../../places/villages/humouth.md).

As the night draws closer, the party starts figuring out where they will be staying for the night. It becomes apparent that there aren't shops or an inn here. Clay suggests that the party asks the locals if they can share their cliff-face dwellings for the night, suggesting that they're friendly and happy to share, but cryptically hints that the party best hope they are good at herding cows.

Most of the party has to, or chooses to, help the villagers herd their cows into the village courtyard as part of their overnight preparations.

| Character | Action | Outcome
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | Helps Clay with the coach. | Volunteers to help Whisper herd cows. |
| [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | Offered dwelling in exchange for cow herding. | Herds cows. |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | Offered dwelling for 2 unconditionally. | Remains in the village. |
| [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | Offered dwelling in exchange for cow herding. | Herds cows with Ahsha's help. |

The night's sleep is windy, with the wind howling through the stone carved dwellings. Most do not sleep well, but it is without interruption.

In the morning the party help Clay prepare for another day's ride, beyond the roads he is familiar with, to [Arnaside](../../places/villages/arnaside.md).

## Arriving at [Arnaside](../../places/villages/arnaside.md)

Most of the day is spent on the road, heading towards [Arnaside](../../places/villages/arnaside.md). Clay becomes comfortable riding the unfamiliar road, with Ephaine riding upfront to help with navigation using the [Astorrel map of South East Kardan](../../maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md). A strong headwind builds as the day progresses.

Eventually the coach reaches [Arnaside](../../places/villages/arnaside.md), and the party get their first glimpse of the elusive village. They are drawn to [the Malneshitas](../../places/buildings/temples/the-malneshitas.md), the only building that isn't squat and of uniform construction.

## [The Malneshitas](../../places/buildings/temples/the-malneshitas.md)

The party decides to knock on the door to [the Malneshitas](../../places/buildings/temples/the-malneshitas.md). From inside, [Nenra Zossa](../../characters/nenra-zossa.md) proclaims that it's open. They proceed inside.

Nenra greets them, asking if they are here to join them (the village and their culture worshipping [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md)). She introduces herself as the *[Arnaside](../../places/villages/arnaside.md) daughter of the Judge Mother* - the civic and spiritual leader of the village.

Ahsha introduces the party, telling Nenra that they're [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Nenra mishears this as [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and declares that they don't need the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md)'s help. When Ahsha tries to correct her, it becomes apparent that she has no knowledge of the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) or what they do. Ahsha explains why they're here and with a friendly demeanour convinces Nenra to cooperate with their mission to investigate the logging activity of the village.

Nenra explains that they are having issues with creatures in the [Walna Forest](../../places/forests/walna-forest.md) that have been attacking them. They have attacked the [Arnaside Logging Camp](../../places/structures/arnaside-logging-camp.md), the village itself, and over the past few months have injured several of the loggers via pits and traps left for them in the forest.

Unable to give more specific details, Nenra directs the party to [Kulegar Bronhor](../../characters/kulegar-bronhor.md) at the [Arnaside Logging Camp](../../places/structures/arnaside-logging-camp.md) to the north.

Before heading there, the party meets back up with Clay, asking what he intends to do. He agrees to stay the night, opting to stay on the edge of the village with his coach and horse. Ahsha pays him extra gp as payment/thanks for staying. He sleeps in the coach that night.

## [Arnaside Logging Camp](../../places/structures/arnaside-logging-camp.md)

The party make their way 30 minutes up the trail north of [Arnaside](../../places/villages/arnaside.md), ascending towards the edge of the [Walna Forest](../../places/forests/walna-forest.md). After 10 more minutes of walking through the deforested edge, they reach the [Arnaside Logging Camp](../../places/structures/arnaside-logging-camp.md).

Here they find [Kulegar Bronhor](../../characters/kulegar-bronhor.md) and 2 of the loggers trying to figure out how to fix one of their timber cart's broken wheels which was broken in an attack by the kobolds the night before. As they approach, Kulegar steps forward to meet them while the other 2 keep their distance.

The party introduce themselves, offering to help with the creatures that have been causing them grief. Kulegar explains that the creatures have raided the logging camp and the village for supplies, to the point where they don't keep anything outside any more, locking equipment in the camp's log cabin or taking things back to the village with them. The creatures have set many traps that have injured loggers venturing further into the forest looking for choice timber. He also mentions that the creatures "come on the wind", alluding to their use of strong winds as a cover for their incursions.

[Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) helps to mend the timber cart's axle using the Mending spell in cooperation with the other loggers who hold the cart and wheel together. They are amazed to see magic in use first hand, especially in their aid.

Ahsha explains why the party is here and their role as [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Kulegar is reluctant, knowing that outside help is taboo. He eventually agrees to show them some of the traps on the forest line, but in the morning as it'll be dark soon. He offers the party the key to the log cabin which they accept, opting to stay in it overnight.

During the night the wind picks up again, blowing a strong gale. This makes it hard for the party to look and listen for potential dangers.

| Character | Shift | Observations |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | 2h | Rustling on the cliff line of no consequence. |
| [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | 2h | Uneventful. |
| [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | 2h | Uses Misty Step to get onto the cabin's roof. Uneventful. |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | 2h | Uneventful. |

In the morning [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) makes breakfast. When [Kulegar Bronhor](../../characters/kulegar-bronhor.md) returns to check on them, she offers him some, but he declines. Locking up the cabin and taking back the key, the party head out to check some expended forest traps.

## Into the [Walna Forest](../../places/forests/walna-forest.md)

Heading a short way into the forest to the logging line, Kulegar shows the party a pitfall trap. Further along the logging line he shows them a tension spike trap made of a board containing an array of sharpened branches, coiled around a tree and held in place by a tripwire rope. The trap has gone off some time ago. Kulegar explains that a logger died here to this trap, and he is visibly uneasy about showing it to the party or being near it.

The party is on edge while inspecting the forest, looking around for any creatures lying in wait, or for anything out of the ordinary.

Heading a bit deeper into the forest with Kulegar, [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) sees a rope tripwire and manages to stop the party from triggering it. Looking up she sees a net made of rope, suspended in the branches of a tree above them. Kulegar comments that this trap wasn't here the day before. Trying to disarm the trap, she manages to catch herself under the net which envelops her.

## Ambushing the Kobolds

The party comes up with a plan to ambush the creatures, if they're nearby. They agree that Ahsha will remain underneath the net, though after it is weakened by cutting it strategically, making it easier for Ahsha to get out of it. The rest of the party spreads out: [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) and [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) on ridges overlooking the area before Ahsha, while [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) hides behind a tree a little further back. [Kulegar Bronhor](../../characters/kulegar-bronhor.md) hides much further back in a bush.

Ahsha starts shouting for help in an attempt to catch the attention of the creatures. Before long, a group of 4 kobolds, including a kobold dragonshield, venture into the clearing in search of the noise. Due to low perception rolls from the party, they make good progress and begin to split in 2 directions before the party notice them.

As battle begins, Ahsha cuts herself free from the net and charges in. Ephaine and Redwyn provide ranged support from above. Whisper makes use of her crossbow, looting the spent arrows as she goes.

When it becomes clear that the party have the measure of the kobolds, Ahsha tries to get hold of the kobold dragonshield so it can be captured and interrogated. Before this can happen, it is killed in the heat of battle. One of the regular kobolds is split in half by a potent attack by Ephaine, spreading viscera across the forest floor.

Eventually the party realises what Ahsha is trying to do and helps her restrain the remaining kobold, putting an end to the fight. Ahsha ties it up with her rope.

## Ambush Aftermath

Kulegar reconvenes with the group, seeing one of the creatures for the first time. He is shocked at what he sees and is highly on edge. When he sees the remains of another kobold split in half on the floor, he questions how that happened. Ephaine explains that she doesn't know the full strength of her magic yet. Horrified and shaken by the sight, Kulegar shouts that the party are monsters, and flees back towards the logging camp.

Undeterred for now, the party tries to question the kobold. Ahsha tries speaking to it but finds that it does not speak common, only knowing draconic. As nobody can speak draconic, communicating is difficult.

The kobold is stubborn and angry, unwilling to cooperate and wanting to fight, despite its hopeless situation. Not seeing how else to proceed, Ahsha whacks the kobold on the head, knocking it unconscious. She picks it up, carrying it underarm.

## Deeper Into the Forest

The party decides to follow the kobold's tracks to see where they came from. Ephaine picks up their footprints and begins tracking them through the forest.

Along the way they come across another tension spike trap which Ephaine notices before they trip the tripwire. They choose to disarm it by cutting the rope from the opposite side.

Proceeding further, about 1 hour from the logging line and 1h 15m from the [Arnaside Logging Camp](../../places/structures/arnaside-logging-camp.md), the party comes across a sudden hill, with a cave entrance set into it: the [Blue Kobold Cave](../../places/caves/blue-kobold-cave.md).
