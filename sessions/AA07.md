*This session was originally cancelled and reconvened as a meeting to handle the transition from [Brooke](../players/brooke.md) ([Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md)) to [Chloe](../players/chloe.md) ([Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md)). All players then agreed to a short role play that introduced Noon to [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md), though this ended up snowballing into a full length session.*
