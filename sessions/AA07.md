*This session was originally cancelled and reconvened as a meeting to handle the transition from [Brooke](../players/brooke.md) ([Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md)) to [Chloe Pepper](../players/chloe-pepper.md) ([Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md)). It then ended up including a short role play opportunity for [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) to meet their new squad hand.*
