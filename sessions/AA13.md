[Wolves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/wolf) and [Dire Wolves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/dire-wolf) gather to stalk the party, only attacking when odds are in their favour.

Each day, roll a d6 to determine how many wolves join the hunt, adding them to the [D&D Beyond Encounter Builder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounter-builder).

| d6 | First Half || Second Half ||
|:---:| --- | ---| --- | --- |
| 1 | | | 1x Wolf | CR 0.25 |
| 2 | | | 2x Wolf | CR 0.5 |
| 3 | 1x Wolf | CR 0.25 | 3x Wolf | CR 0.75 |
| 4 | 2x Wolf | CR 0.5 | 4x Wolf | CR 1 |
| 5 | 3x Wolf | CR 0.75 | 1x Dire Wolf<br>2x Wolf | CR 1.5 |
| 6 | 1x Dire Wolf | CR 1 | 2x Dire Wolf | CR 2 |

The strength of the hunt determines its behaviour.
