## Pre-Session

### Characterisation Prompt

> What decision have you made that you've came to regret?

| Character | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | Childhood response to problems was typically violence. Corrected later in life with maturity and regulation. Regrets not learning that lesson earlier. | characterisation.1
| [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | Causing an avalanche in [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md), trapping several [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) and setting into motion the events that saw her leaving home to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). |
| [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) | No regrets - as a Schiller it has never been an option to regret ones actions as they only accept perfection in everything you do. |
| [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) | No regrets - belief that she is always in the right. |

### Initiative Pool

## Griffons on the Road: Aftermath

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) helps [Ulfric Sander](../characters/ulfric-sander.md) and [Selene Sander](../characters/selene-sander.md) from the overturned and collapsed cart, checking them for wounds. Selene looks woozy and has blood running down half of her face. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) checks her out, finding a head laceration and signs of a concussion, but no more serious injuries. She casts Healing Word to aid her, clearing her mind and burning off the slick blood from her face.

Selene is surprised and unsure what Ephaine just did. Ephaine explains that the party are [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and that she used magic to heal her. She reacts negatively, telling Ulfric that the pair should leave. Ahsha tries to calm the couple down, explaining that they are here to help, motioning to the two dead griffons. Ulfric is stunned at their combat prowess, thanking [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) profusely and reassuring Selene.

Ahsha inquires where the couple were heading. They explain that they are heading from Mossband, through [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), to Eaglesfield to visit their son who recently joined the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and is stationed here. Ephaine and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) are surprised by the length of their journey, finding Eaglesfield on the squad's [Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md). Ahsha is briefly suspicious of the pair out on the road together but finds their story and motivation to be genuine.

Noon recognises Mossband as the location that his last mission in [Dolphin Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/dolphin-squad.md) took place in.

Ahsha asks if the couple can make it to Eaglesfield on foot. Ulfric suggests they can, though the journey will be slower now without their horse and cart. Ephaine offers to give them a ride back to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). The pair debate their options. Ulfric suggests taking the offer while Selene sees turning around as a sort of failure. Ulfric reluctantly agrees, telling the party that they will attempt to hitch a ride for the rest of the day, using the wrecked cart and dead horse as an image of help needed.

Ahsha helps the couple gather up their possessions which includes a few sacks of food. She provides them with 2 day rations before offering them grasshopper legs from her jar. They decline while she eats two. Noon offers Ulfric one of his daggers, but he declines, not wishing to invite trouble from those who see it.

[Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) get back in their wagon and continue west toward [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). The road is still busy but nothing of note happens. Camp is made again on the roadside, night passing without incident.

*[Long rest]*

## Arriving in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md)

At the end of the next day, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) and [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) spot the tall and wide city walls of [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) in the distance. As they approach they find an open gatehouse without guards, making their way inside. Ephaine looks for somewhere to store their horse and cart overnight, not immediately finding somewhere. They advance along the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) as it runs through the middle of [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), opening out into the marketplace as it encircles the Temple to the Resistance.

From here Ephaine finds somewhere to store the horse and cart, paying herself for stabling. After the party leave the building they notice [Two Anchors House](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/two-anchors-house.md) several doors down and go inside.

The inn is packed with patrons enjoying a rowdy Balghast evening, honouring [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md) in the usual fashion. Initially the party wonder if there is a festival before some realise the religious association of the day of the week. Finding no empty table on the ground floor, [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) heads upstairs to search for one while Ephaine, [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md), and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) buy a round of drinks from the bar as well as two double bed room keys.

Ephaine and Korina notice several [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) near the entrance keeping watch over the inn. When they ask the innkeeper [Curtis Donovan](../characters/curtis-donovan.md) about this, he explains that they are merely here to keep the peace, that's all.

Ahsha finds the inn equally busy on the second floor and so ascends higher, finding a dance floor with live music on the third. She abandons her search, getting swept up in the merriment and dancing away. She is noticed by a white furred tabaxi who seems to be having fun.

The rest of the party search for Ahsha, eventually finding her higher up. They are slightly annoyed that she couldn't locate a table. Instead the party stands to one side and quietly enjoys their drinks. Korina drinks her fair share of ale.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) retires to the room she is sharing with Korina early, spending some time with her star chart. She takes the magical inks she bought in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) to begin improving it for the use of the Augury spell, completing about a third of the work. Noon soon goes to bed himself, sick of the common atmosphere of [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) and wishing for the squad's time here to end as soon as possible. Ahsha and Korina continue drinking before eventually retiring themselves.

## Ephaine's Nightmare

During the night [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) dreams of [Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) and what she said to the party while they were trapped in the cellar of an inn in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md). Her dream replays moments from the encounter where [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) was talking. Eventually she dreams of [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) calling her a loose end before executing her with a point of her finger. It flashes green as Disintegrate is cast.

Ephaine wakes up in a cold sweat suddenly. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) sleeps through the moment, none the wiser. Ephaine tries her best to go back to sleep but struggles to rest meaningfully for the rest of the night.

*[Long rest]*

## Searching for Clues

Over breakfast [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) questions [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and her plan for their mission to find [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md). Noon points out that they have no leads and that the last known whereabouts of the squad was [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). There is nothing to even say that they made their way to their mission or passed through [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md).

The party realise that they should start looking for clues in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). They split up to ask different people if they have seen the squad pass through.

| Marketplace | Stables |
| --- | --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) |
| [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) | [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) |

Ephaine and Noon are fruitless at the stables. They find the stable keeper to be curt and unhelpful, being somewhat rude to them despite them pressing their [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) credentials.

Ahsha and Korina find [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) patrolling the empty marketplace, noticing them coming and going from the [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) Stronghold - a walled fort that borders one end of the long marketplace that runs perpendicular to the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md). They make their way over and are greeted by an [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) who walks toward them, wary of strangers approaching the stronghold with ill intent.

Ahsha and Korina waste no time explaining that they are from the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and are here to find [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md). The pair convey the descriptions of the squad provided to them through [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md). The sergeant can remember [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md), and with the help of the [Astornox Guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) working under him, recants a tale of the squad helping them with some business while passing through the town.

[Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) helped to locate a building where a gang had been imprisoning and torturing immigrants coming through or staying in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), notably elves from the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). After finding the building they reported it to the [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) who offered them gold for their help to corner the gang and bring them to justice, but [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) declined, explaining that the squad needed to move on to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) on important business.

When the pair ask additional questions about the gang, the sergeant postulates that the gang are part of [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md), a notorious gang that "practically run Carnmere". The guard divulges information about a missing [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) ([Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md)) who has likely been captured by [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md), the information coming to the [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) after an [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) bulletin circulated appealing for potential locations of the basement he is supposedly tied up in.

With two potential towns to move on to, Ahsha and Korina regroup with Ephaine and Noon, the party sharing what they have all learned. After some debate Ahsha decides that the [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) lead feels stronger, and so [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) will head there next.

## The Road to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md)

Now mid-morning, [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) get back in their wagon and continue south on the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) toward [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md). By early afternoon they reach the junction to the town, turning right onto part of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) roadway, as instructed by the road sign.

Next to it they notice another T-shaped post with [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) banners (brown background, [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) logo at its centre, legion number in roman numerals below) for II, IV, and V legion. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) recognises V legion as they are typically stationed at Fort Maloja near her home town of [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md).

Along this road the party settles down for the night, once again going off road and finding a quiet spot amongst the treeline. Night watch proceeds in the following order:

- [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md)
- [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md)
- [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)

## Gnolls in the Night

During Ephaine's watch she notices a shadowy figure watching her from the trees, hiding behind one. She wastes no time casting Hold Person on it, succeeding in freezing it in place. She shouts at it, telling it to give up. As she uses Starry Form to prepare for combat, the light it emanates reveals that the creature is a gnoll hunter.

*[Initiative order begins]*

The gnoll, paralysed by Ephaine's spell, manages to squeeze out a guttural sound which its fellow gnolls recognise as trouble. Suddenly the other gnolls - three regular gnolls, a gnoll flesh gnawer, and a gnoll pack lord all break their positions and begin to attack the camp.

[Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) and [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) wake from the sound of Ephaine projecting her voice, Korina leaping straight to her feet instinctually. They both grab their weapons and advance toward Ephaine to join the fray. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) takes slightly longer to rouse, eventually getting up, composing himself, and tentatively moving to the camp fire to join the ensuing battle.

The regular gnolls rush Ephaine's position before Korina steps in to help, casting Shield of Faith on her. She charges forward, meeting two of the regular gnolls and the gnoll flesh gnawer on the edge of Ephaine's starry form's projection of light.

Noon casts Dancing Lights, floating four balls of light through the forest to where enemies might be, helping to illuminate the gnoll hunter and gnoll pack lord who choose to attack from a distance. The gnoll hunter never gets a chance to be attacked, getting blasted by Guiding Bolt by Ephaine.

As the gnolls begin their attack, Korina takes the brunt of the damage. Ephaine steps back toward [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) who fights and kills one of the regular gnolls while another ambushes Noon. Korina gets wounded by the gnoll flesh gnawer which is relentless with its attacks and refuses to take hits, martial or magical. Korina unleashes her breath weapon on the group before Ahsha rushes over to assist. Together they split the pack of gnolls and manage to flank them.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md), seeing a tough situation before the party and being hit by multiple arrows by the gnoll pack lord, calls on [Nills](../characters/nills.md) for her help, casting Summon Shadowspawn to compel [Nills](../characters/nills.md) to reveal herself to the group and intervene directly. She appears on the edge of Ephaine's glow, nearest the gnoll pack lord and screams terrifyingly, scaring several of the gnolls and [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) in the process.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I think we could do with your help on this one [sister shadow](../characters/nills.md).

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Yes of course [brother light](../characters/noon-schiller.md), it would be my pleasure.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) runs over to the pack lord and attempts to hack at it with a shadowy blade fashioned crudely from her arm, but it dissipates across the gnoll's chest. Ephaine is able to whittle the pack lord down with multiple casts of Guiding Bolt and the help of Noon casting Eldritch Blast.

Meanwhile the bulk of the gnolls, scared by [Nills](../characters/nills.md), are also subjected to Order's Demand from Korina while Ephaine blesses the party. Korina orders them to drop their weapons, causing them to lose their spears in panic and instead attack with bites. Ahsha and Korina carve through the frightened and disarmed gnolls with relative ease.

*[Initiative order ends]*
