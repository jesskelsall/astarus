## [Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) vs [Komodo Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md)

[Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) meets [Komodo Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) prior to their fight. [Faelon Fireburner](../characters/faelon-fireburner.md) is confident of his abilities, verbally sparring with [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) before both squads emerge into the arena.

*[Initiative order begins]*

As the fight begins [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) focus fire on [Tarpher Forestcaller](../characters/tarpher-forestcaller.md), almost knocking him unconscious before he even has a chance to do anything. He uses Wild Shape to transform into a dire wolf, something the pair were trying to avoid.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Eremus Vitur](../characters/eremus-vitur.md) spar in the early stages of the match. Eremus gets the upper hand due to his barbarian resistances to the best of Ahsha's damage.

[Uther Wildfang](../characters/uther-wildfang.md) gets in Ephaine's face, hitting her repeatedly with his greataxe. As Faelon joins in she casts Moonbeam on the three of them, knocking Tarpher out of his wolf form.

Ahsha and Eremus continue to trade blows while [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) casts Arms of Hadar, catching both [Faelon Fireburner](../characters/faelon-fireburner.md) and Uther in its eldritch grasp. When Uther joins Eremus in focusing on Ahsha, Noon casts the spell again and catches the pair in it.

Ephaine casts Misty Step to teleport to the top of the wall, teetering on its edge deftly. From here she avoids the risk of melee attacks. [Faelon Fireburner](../characters/faelon-fireburner.md) joins in the melee on Ahsha. [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) tries to keep Ahsha alive with Healing Word but she succumbs to her injuries, falling unconscious.

Tarpher again Wild Shapes into a dire wolf, but Ephaine once again snipes him with a well placed Moonbeam, knocking him back into his regular form and also catching Faelon in the blast. [Tarpher Forestcaller](../characters/tarpher-forestcaller.md) falls unconscious.

Ephaine switches her Starry Form to Chalice, using it to heal the entire party, particularly [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md). Almost as soon as she returns to her feet she is knocked unconscious again by the relentless barbarian attacks. Redwyn is then surrounded by Faelon and Uther who target her next, working methodically through [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md). As Redwyn falls unconscious it dawns on [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) that they are losing.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) focuses [Eremus Vitur](../characters/eremus-vitur.md) with Eldritch Blast but isn't able to prevent him from downing Redwyn. Ephaine desperately casts healing magic on both Ahsha and Redwyn but both succumb to further injuries quickly as [Komodo squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) control the arena with ease.

[Faelon Fireburner](../characters/faelon-fireburner.md) climbs up to the wall and fights [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) directly. [Uther Wildfang](../characters/uther-wildfang.md) is able to grab her and pull her to the ground, knocking her unconscious after he retrieves her. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) is able to knock [Eremus Vitur](../characters/eremus-vitur.md) unconscious with Eldritch Blast in the dying moments of the match, though Eremus had already given up, seeing the fight was a foregone conclusion by this point.

Faelon and Uther swarm Noon and finish him off to secure [Komodo Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md)'s victory.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## After the Match

[Faelon Fireburner](../characters/faelon-fireburner.md) appeals to the crowd, getting them to chant his name. [Komodo Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) help [Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) to their feet, who are dejected by their sudden loss and the end of their participation in the tournament.

## Post Match Drinks

At the end of the day both squads retire to [Geor's Door](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/geors-door.md) for drinks, swapping compliments about their fighting prowess. [Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) wishes [Komodo Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) good luck in the tournament final.
