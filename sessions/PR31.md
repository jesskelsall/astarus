## Saoirse Finds the General Store

Before going to bed, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) leaves the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md) via the southern gate on the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md), searching for the general store that [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) told her to find. She puts her military badge away as she goes and doesn't struggle to leave the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md).

Searching the muddy street leaving the wall for further out of the city, she struggles to find any hints of a general store. It is turning from sunset to night as a worker begins lighting gas lamps for the evening.

She makes her way back to the gatehouse, waiting patiently behind other citizens who are making their way into the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md), taking turns to show their [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md). Once at the front she shows the [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) her [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) badge and does her best to look sad. The guard treats her as a lost child at first, treating her more like an adult once he sees her badge.

She points her to [Ethel's Wares](../places/buildings/shops/ethels-wares.md) around the first left turn from the wall, two doors down. As she leaves she uses Minor Illusion to make it sound like the guard farted, drawing laughter from the other guards on duty inside of the gatehouse's interior.

Saoirse rounds the corner and discovers [Ethel's Wares](../places/buildings/shops/ethels-wares.md), heading inside. She finds a low arranged room with a female human patron browsing the books. As she wanders she looks over her shoulder, catching a sentence of fiction. Saoirse spoils the story for her, causing the patron to sigh and put the book down before browsing another.

Looking to the back of the room, Saoirse sees [Etheldreda Dowsing](../characters/etheldreda-dowsing.md) (Ethel) who catches her gaze and asks if she's here for anything in particular, not letting on that she knows exactly why she is here. The pair exchange conversation about random wares before the other patron comes to the counter to buy a book for 2 sp. She asks if she may sell the book back to her once she is done, which is agreeable.

As the patron walks out of the store, Saoirse casts Minor Illusion to create another fart sound near her, not hiding what she is doing from Ethel. Ethel calls it a nice trick and asks Saoirse where she learned how to do it. When Saoirse gives a vague explanation of an old friend who taught her it when she was younger, Ethel grins and uses Prestidigitation to close the blinds, revealing that she knew that [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) was sending someone to her. She introduces herself by her full name.

Saoirse isn't phased by all of this, talking to Ethel plainly. Ethel reveals that she was also contacted and has made some items available to Saoirse, though first she wants something from Saoirse. Climbing onto the counter, she gives her riddle to Saoirse:

> You will have what you seek when you provide me something owned by few, coveted by many, and difficult to share.

Saoirse tries to bypass the riddle by telling Ethel that she's not good at riddles, to which Ethel retorts that Saoirse isn't any of her business. Saoirse then tries to convince her to be plain and tell her exactly what she needs, implying that Ethel doesn't know what she wants. She isn't able to change Ethel's mind, telling Saoirse no directly, expressing interest in seeing what she comes back with.

With that, Saoirse decides it's time to leave. Ethel casts Prestidigitation once more, rolling the blinds back up, before returning to her previously jovial and semi-senile demeanour. She wishes Saoirse a good day and that she looks forward to seeing her again soon.

Before leaving, Saoirse looks at the large tome that Ethel was reading when she arrived. She sees that the pages are completely blank.

## Staying the Night

With night falling, the party looks for lodging for the evening, realising that as [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) they don't have any arranged accommodation. They consider a few options including [the Mission's End](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-missions-end.md) and returning to [the Dog's Groke](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md), but those options are dismissed as too expensive and too awkward respectively.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) suggests they try staying overnight in a stable. Heading out of the eastern [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) gate, they try their luck at the closest stables. Here the staff member behind the counter tells them that they don't take overnight lodging but can point the party towards accommodation. When the party indicate that they want something "dirt cheap", they are pointed towards [the Rat's Nest](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rats-nest.md). While here their accommodation and food is squalid/poor.

| Expense | Cost |
| --- | ---:|
| Accommodation, squalid | 1 sp |
| Meal, squalid | 3 cp |
| Mug of ale | 4 cp |

*[Long rest]*

## Saoirse's Morning Appearance

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) wakes up in the same room as [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md). She begins to wake as Thanea is getting up, getting out of bed as normal. Thanea soon realises that Saoirse looks different - she appears more masculine. Her face is more angular, her hair appears shorter & shaggier, and her breasts appear smaller. Her eyes and voice remain unchanged.

When she makes Saoirse aware of this, she is shocked. Lacking a mirror to see for herself, she is confused by what is going on. Thanea tries but fails to show her a Minor Illusion of how she appears. Saoirse mentions having a dream about not quite feeling herself. Thanea questions this, but Saoirse assures her it wasn't another deva dream.

Thanea touches her face, realising that her finger goes beyond where her skin is before touching her actual face, making it clear that an illusion of some sort is at work. Saoirse wonders how this could be.

Heading downstairs, Torbra and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) also notice her appearance. Saoirse accuses [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) of doing this as a prank, but [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) explains that her Disguise Self spell can only affect her own appearance. The party is somewhat worried that if Saoirse is casting spells in her sleep, she may be a danger to the group when they sleep near each other.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Druidcraft, learning that today's weather will be grey with rain on the horizon.

## Supplies for the Road

With their morning the party head to various shops in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) to stock up on supplies for the mission ahead. Torbra agrees that they should take the time to stock up before leaving the city.

| Character | Supplies | Cost |
| --- | --- | ---:|
| [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | | |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | | |
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | Crossbow, light<br>Crossbow bolts (20)<br>Case, crossbow bolt | 22 gp |
| [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) | | |

## Searching for Transport

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) considers how [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) should try and get to the middle of the Humar Estuary. While she initially considers hiring a horse and cart, she feels it would be faster to go by boat.

The party head to the west side of the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md), walking down the sloping streets that reveal the city's thriving port. From here [Fort Eldrick](../places/forts/fort-eldrick.md) and Fort Knowe's structures can be seen on the opposite side of [Duskmere](../places/rivers-lakes/duskmere.md), framing the horizon. Many ships of all sizes are docked or moving across [Duskmere](../places/rivers-lakes/duskmere.md) towards the [Sea of Songs](../places/seas-oceans/sea-of-songs.md), some adorned in brown sails bearing the symbol of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md).

Torbra looks for somewhere selling a row boat. She finds various businesses specialising in boat construction. Amongst these she finds several rowing boats for sale for 50 gp. Considering other options she leads the party down to the docks to see if anyone is willing to take them to the estuary aboard their ship.

Here she meets [Dinua Costello](../characters/dinua-costello.md), the captain of [the Maiden's Accompaniment](../places/ships/the-maidens-accompaniment.md). She informs Torbra that she is shipping goods to [Yeatscale](../places/cities/yeatscale.md) and would be willing to ferry them to the Humar Estuary for 1 gp each (4 gp total), providing they are willing to jump overboard into the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) at the opportune moment. The party are happy with this arrangement.

The captain asks them why they are heading to the estuary, nothing that there isn't much there of interest. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tells her that it is need-to-know [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) business, which she takes well enough. She ushers them onto her ship, noting that they will be leaving shortly as their cargo is nearly fully loaded. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) offers to help but when Dinua asks about her sailing experience and finds it non-existent, Dinua thanks her but declines her offer.

## Sailing Down River

Before pushing off from dock the party sees [Dinua Costello](../characters/dinua-costello.md) speaking with some [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) to confirm [the Maiden's Accompaniment](../places/ships/the-maidens-accompaniment.md)'s departure. With that confirmed, they set off. It takes most of the day to cross [Duskmere](../places/rivers-lakes/duskmere.md).

Once the ship is underway, the captain asks the party what their business is on the estuary, trying to see if she can learn anything more. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tells her they are on a treasure hunt of sorts. When she then asks if they have any other interesting stories, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) offers to play the bagpipes, but she declines.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) presents [Etheldreda Dowsing](../characters/etheldreda-dowsing.md)'s riddle to the captain. She enjoys the challenge, believing that Saoirse already knows the answer. Between her, Saoirse and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), several answers are debated including: experience, a military badge, citizenship, friendship, and happy memories. Saoirse eventually reveals that she doesn't have the answer, disappointing Dinua, but reveals her belief that the correct answer is youth, justifying her belief.

The captain takes her leave to manage the ship's activities. The party go to bed as promised on the deck of the ship, as all of the space below deck is already spoken for.

*[Long rest]*

The party wakes up to heavy rain beating down on them. The day is grey with low hanging and fast moving clouds whipped up by the strong winds helping to blow the ship out to sea.

The captain informs the party that in about an hour the ship will pull closer to the edge of the Humar Estuary, at which point they'll need to jump overboard. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) offers her a weather forecast but Dinua is unable to properly hear (or understand) what [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is saying, thwarting her good will.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Druidcraft anyway, learning that the day's weather will remain rainy, though the wind will subside.

## Jumping Overboard

An hour quickly passes. The ship moves closer to the shore of the estuary and the captain comes over to wish them good luck and send them off. Everyone jumps overboard into the water below.

| Character | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | Inhales sharply and takes on water. Sinks below the water's surface. |
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | Inhales sharply and takes on water. Sinks below the water's surface. |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | Hits the water chest first, taking damage.<br>Inhales sharply and takes on water. Sinks below the water's surface. |
| [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) | Holds breath. Re-surfaces. |

With the exception of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), everyone begins to drown in the deceptively deep and murky water near the shore. She immediately dives looking for the others, finding an arm grasping for help. She pulls Thanea back to the surface.

Saoirse and Torbra continue to drown. Saoirse takes damage as she begins to feel her strength leaving her, her limbs getting heavy and her vision fading. Both can see faint light from the surface, but Saoirse becomes aware that if she doesn't get help very soon she will pass out and likely drown.

Saoirse attempts to cast Light on her clothing so she can be found more easily. She opens her mouth and attempts the verbal component of the spell but she is unable to create the correct sounds while underwater.

Thanea asks [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) about transforming into an aquatic animal while looking into the water below. She isn't able to see anyone. At this moment Torbra swims upward and breaches the surface. By this point both Torbra and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) are struggling to stay buoyant in the water due to the weight of themselves, their armour, and their supplies. Saoirse tries kicking to propel herself in the direction of the light.

Thanea pulls out her length of rope, casting Light on it and dropping the end of it into the water. Saoirse sees it and gets a hand on it. Thanea and Torbra gently pull on the rope to lift Saoirse to the surface, trying not to sink themselves in the process. Thanea casts Mage Hand to help pull some of Saoirse's weight, aiding in the process.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) uses Wild Shape to transform into a trout and heads for the land. The partial salt content of the water stings, her fish form not able to process anything but freshwater. She emerges into boggy terrain full of reeds. The party follows her, clambering onto relatively dry land some distance further inland.
