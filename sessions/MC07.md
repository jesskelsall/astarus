## Meeting Lorena

After [Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md) enters [The Nasty Huntress](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-nasty-huntress.md) and is pointed towards the party by [Askad Greybelt](../characters/askad-greybelt.md), she introduces herself and sits down, knowing that the party is here to help with the wolves that have been threatening [Sonnigeweide](../places/villages/sonnigeweide.md).

As she gets into a relatively comfortable position on a pulled up chair, her plate armour moving noisily as she lowers herself, she begins to speak of the wolves that have been coming from the Schulterwood to the northwest. She is here because a farmhand was recently killed by them, prompting the [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) to get involved, placing a bounty and searching for capable adventurers to assist.

Lorena offers 40 gp if the party are able to exterminate them and return to her. She apologises for not being able to assist them directly, having to patrol the forest's edge in case they attack again.

She then asks who the party are, expecting an adventuring party name. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) states that they are from [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md), causing Lorena's eyes to light up. Regardless she asks for proof, inspecting Vētrall's [Coin of Family](../items/coins/coin-of-family.md) when presented with it. The party introduce themselves one by one.

Lorena mentions that she's going to have some of Askad's famous pumpkin pie while here, prompting the rest of the party to order some too. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) orders two slices while [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) declines to order, content with his ale. A plate is brought out with 5/6 slices present. Kera eats a slice immediately while the others are wrapped up in cheese cloth for the road. Kera describes his cloth as his "pie rag".

As Lorena settles in to eat, the party get up to leave. She wishes them well, noting that she will be patrolling later but otherwise will be staying here at [the Nasty Huntress](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-nasty-huntress.md). She makes it clear that they should return here and wait for her when they have news. The party agrees before departing.

## Searching for Wolves

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) uses her knowledge of the sun's position to orient the party, leading them northwest towards the Schulterwood. They emerge from the village centre, crossing farmer's fields and passing two nearby farmsteads, both given a wide enough berth.

After half an hour of walking over flat land and then gentle grazing hills, the party arrives at the forest's edge, a line of dense trees. Here Marik checks for tracks, firstly noticing heavy tracks running along the forest's edge ([Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md)'s patrol route).

Marik uses Wild Shape to transform into a wolf, allowing her to take advantage of her form's superior sense of smell. She quickly picks up the smell of horses, but also of wolves, leading into the forest. Unable to speak, she looks at the party before heading in, everyone else following her lead without question.

After transforming, [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) attempts to pet Marik, but she recoils away, growling back in disapproval.

After half an hour of following the wolves' scent, a small stream is found running down a gentle hill between the trees. Here Marik loses the scent as it crosses. She takes a moment to search up and down the stream for its continuation, finding the scent emerge on the other side further down, suggesting that the wolves followed the stream briefly to mask their trail.

Another half an hour passes, the party still following Marik's wolf form. As Wild Shape ends, Marik can briefly be seen sniffing downwards at the ground before realising that she is no longer a wolf, embarrassing her. She informs the party of the scent she was following and is then able to pick up the scent while in her regular goliath form, heading deeper.

## The Forest Clearing

Continuing through the forest for another 15 minutes, [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) leads the party down a short steep hill that sees the treeline end, revealing a meadow clearing in the middle of the forest. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) by this point has taken to chopping grass with his greatsword, idly hacking away, doing so with more enthusiasm when Marik watches him judgementally.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) leads the party through the meadow, not noticing the pack of six wolves sleeping during the day in a circle ahead. As they continue, three of the wolves raise their heads above the tall grass, growling at the sight of the party.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Two of the wolves immediately rush to [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and bite them hard, while the third engages with [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md). Kera retaliates with a greatsword swing but misses in the heat of the sudden threat to the party.

The remaining three wolves get up and rush to the party: one more attacks Kera, one goes for [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md), and the remaining one attacks [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md). [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) casts Dissonant Whispers on the wolf attacking them, killing it immediately.

Nainarv attempts to hit the wolf attacking him with his hammer (critical miss) but falls backwards and drops it, prompting the wolf to pounce on him and bite down hard. One of the wolves attacking Kera charges over to assist, but Marik finishes it off with her spear as it runs past her. Meanwhile Kera lands a clean slice on a wolf's side, cutting its innards out in one motion.

As the wolves begin to drop one by one, Marik casts Produce Flame and attempts to hurl it at one of the wolves on Vētrall, but drops the flame while throwing the fire in a pitching motion. Vētrall kills the penultimate wolf with Vicious Mockery:

*[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md):*
> Listen you little shit, all your friends are dead!

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) lands the killing blow on the final wolf. He kicks it to the ground before slicing at its belly, gutting it.

*[Initiative order ends]*

As the last wolf is killed, Vētrall rushes over to Nainarv to help him up, seeing lots of blood. Nainarv thanks them for their help but chooses to stand on his own, using his warhammer to prop him up, insisting that he will be fine despite being out of breath and looking worse for wear.

Kera pulls the wolves into one spot, creating a pile. Marik suggests bringing some evidence back to [Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md), suggesting they take some ears or teeth. Kera points out that they each have one tail, everyone else agreeing that there will be more certainty over the quantity if they return with a number of tails.

Marik borrows Vētrall's dagger and begins cutting the tails from each wolf. The first is ruined when the dagger slips, shearing the flesh and fur from one half of the tail. In total Marik collects 5 wolf tails, a somewhat messy affair.

When Marik gives the dagger back to Vētrall, they put their hand on the grip without looking. A wet sensation turns to horror as they realise that the dagger is covered in blood, now on their hand. As they hold up the dagger and chastise Marik, the blood begins running down towards their sleeve, prompting Vētrall to lower their hand, drop the dagger, and try to flick as much of the blood away as possible. While looking for something to clean the dagger with, Kera offers his "pie rag", cleaning the blood for them. The party is then upset when Kera wraps their pumpkin pie back up in the now bloodied rag.

The wolves now taken care of, the party rests for a while longer, eating their pumpkin pie. When Nainarv expresses regret at not buying a slice, Kera breaks him off half of his, which he is grateful for. Vētrall also offered the last bite of theirs which Nainarv declines, but Kera asks for it, Vētrall allowing him to have it. Nainarv takes a drink of wine from his waterskin. 

Marik quickly eats her pie after tying up the wolf tails with a length of rope, slinging them over her shoulder.

*[Everyone: short rest]*

## Too Many Trails

The party wonders if they have just wiped out the troublesome wolves or if there are more lurking elsewhere in the forest. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) looks around, spotting seven sets of tracks emerging from the wolves' sleeping spot, each heading out radially in a different direction. Realising that they just killed six wolves, she suggests that they may have one more to kill. It dawns on others that perhaps these tracks are simply common routes that the six used.

Unsure if their work is done, the party checks the clearing for a better sign of what to do next. Nainarv notices that one of the tracks is more heavily worn, so [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) follows it, but loses track of where it goes when it reaches the forest on the opposite side of the clearing.

## Returning to the Knight

With the late afternoon sun beginning to grow dark, the party resolves to return to [Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md) at [the Nasty Huntress](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-nasty-huntress.md) and report what they've done, confident that they will have satisfied the conditions of her reward.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) leads the party back to [Sonnigeweide](../places/villages/sonnigeweide.md), the party choosing to move quickly to avoid being out in the wilderness at night. They reach the edge of the village right as night has set in fully.

Entering [the Nasty Huntress](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-nasty-huntress.md) they find [Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md) and a high elven [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) sat in the tavern room together, conversing quietly. As they enter Lorena is happy to see them again, asking how their hunt went. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) states that they found the wolves.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) takes off the bundle of wolf tails and proudly drops it on their table, causing a panicked scene to erupt. The [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) who was enjoying his soup pulls the bowl away to avoid it getting knocked over. Lorena is shocked, pushing her chair out to get some distance before rising to stand. She is horrified at the sight of amputated tails and the now congealed blood, not used to the gruesome realities of her role as Knight of [Golfmaul](../places/towns/golfmaul.md).

Lorena asks the party if they killed all of the wolves. Vētrall is relatively confident that they did, stating so as fact. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) questions them out loud, frustrating the party.

*[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md):*
> Did we...?

Before Lorena can express any doubts, Vētrall reveals to Lorena the party's plan to camp overnight near the forest's edge in case any more wolves appear. If none do, perhaps the threat has passed. Lorena is encouraging of their idea, stating that her and the [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) will be out on patrol tonight, as soon as they've eaten.

Lorena explains that [Askad Greybelt](../characters/askad-greybelt.md) is serving "toad in the hole". The name confuses Kera who wonders why anyone would be eating toad, and how it tastes. Lorena kindly explains that it is a savoury pudding with sausages baked directly into it. A brief conversation breaks out over the origin of the name, Askad shouting from the other room that it is what her mother called it. The party choose to partake as well, a meal well earned after combat.

When food arrives Lorena scarfs a small portion quickly before getting ready to head out with the other [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md), wanting to saddle up and patrol now that it is dark.

Kera asks why she was so shocked at the sight of the wolf tails, suggesting that she must have seen worse in her line of work. Lorena puts on a brave face and dodges the question, noting that her duties are incredibly varied and it is a privilege to be a Knight of [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md). Vētrall detects fear that suggests she is uncomfortable with the current wolf problem.

As the pair leave, Lorena once again wishes the party good luck, pointing out that they will likely hear [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) horses patrolling through the night.

## Disturbing a Farmer

Now fed, the party heads northwest again, looking for somewhere to camp. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) leads them to the furthest of two farmsteads in the direction they'd gone that afternoon.

Once at the farmstead the party looks for where they might camp, and how much they can see from here. When [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) tries to climb onto the wooden shed opposite the house by standing on the picket fence, he slips, putting all of his weight through the horizontal fence beam, shattering it loudly.

The party panics as they hear the cobble and thatch farmstead's front door open. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) hurriedly moves to Kera, pretending to be fixing up his armour as a diversion. [Rowan Stonesworn](../characters/rowan-stonesworn.md) appears in the doorway wearing a nightgown and holding a walking candlestick. Angry at the commotion outside, he angrily asks what the party is doing here in the dark, as his wife is sleeping inside and he doesn't want her to be disturbed.

The party attempt to explain that they're here to combat the wolf problem but Rowan points out that they're not [Waldwächters](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md). As each person bumbles through reasons for why they're here, Rowan notices his broken fence. Getting increasingly angry, he demands that they pay to fix the damages and leave at once. Kera provides him with a silver coin before the party apologetically leave.

As they walk off towards [Sonnigeweide](../places/villages/sonnigeweide.md), [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) angrily tells Kera that his behaviour wasn't becoming of [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md), and if he ever wants to join, he needs to think about the organisation's reputation and goodwill towards others.

## Camping Nearby

Worried that Rowan will likely open the door and head outside if the wolves create a disturbance in the night, the party opt to camp nearby, putting enough distance between them and his farmstead to keep him happy. Nainarv suggests not lighting a campfire in case he sees it, but also because it might scare off any wolves.

The cold late autumn night prompts everyone to wrap up in their sleeping bags as best as possible. Nainarv only has a blanket, replying when asked that he is used to staying in inns, usually staying as close to civilisation as he can. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) offers him the bottom of their sleeping bag to sleep on, but Nainarv takes offence, comparing it to a dog sleeping on the bottom of a bed. He makes do with his blanket, wrapping himself up tightly.

| Character(s) | Shift | Observations |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) | 4h | Quiet. |
| [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) | 4h | [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) ride along forest's edge. |

*[Kera, Nainarv, Vētrall: long rest]*  
*[Marik: short rest]*

## Screaming in the Night

About an hour before sunrise, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) hears the sound of male screaming ([Rowan Stonesworn](../characters/rowan-stonesworn.md)) coming from the direction of the nearby farmstead. They waste no time waking everyone up, urging them to act quickly. Vētrall and [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md), who slept in his armour, take off running almost immediately.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) takes a moment to get going, while [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) almost sleeps through the wake up call. Marik gets him to wake up. When he finally does, he runs while still covered in his blanket, too tired to realise that he is leaving his gear (including his warhammer) behind. He throws off the blanket and attempts to catch up to the group.

On arrival at the farm, Vētrall and Kera spot three wolves savaging [Rowan Stonesworn](../characters/rowan-stonesworn.md) outside of his farmstead's front door while a much larger dire wolf prowls behind them. Behind it three more wolves are holding a perimeter in the direction of the forest, not having yet cleared the picket fence surrounding the farmyard.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Not yet sighted by the wolves, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) manages to climb onto the farm's pitched thatched roof, clambering up onto their chest. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) launches her spear at one of the wolves but misses, causing the three that have just killed [Rowan Stonesworn](../characters/rowan-stonesworn.md) to notice and descend on the group, two clearing the fence. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) rush in, the latter casting Shield of Faith on Marik.

Vētrall casts Levitate on Rowan, levitating his body 10ft into the air, away from the other wolves that are now moving into the farmyard, the dire wolf beginning to move towards the bulk of the party as its regular wolves begin biting. The two wolves the clear the fence gang up on Marik unsuccessfully as Kera cuts them down easily with his greatsword.

Vētrall casts Dissonant Whispers on the dire wolf, getting into its mind. It charges in the opposite direction, reaching the corner of the picket fence on the opposite side of the farmyard before turning back. This prompts the patrolling wolves to descend into combat with the rest of the party.

As the dire wolf reaches the party, Marik is surrounded by wolves and Kera takes the brunt of the dire wolf's attacks. Immediately Kera is knocked unconscious by a severe bite that pushes him to the floor. Marik uses Wild Shape to transform into an elk. Nainarv casts Guiding Bolt on one of the arriving wolves, piercing it with a beam of radiant energy that emerges in three beams as it refracts off its innards, killing it instantly. He moves in behind a wolf flanking Kera, punching it in the rear, realising he doesn't have his warhammer.

Nainarv casts Cure Wounds on Kera, bringing her back of consciousness. Marik is ganged up on by the wolves, hitting one with her elk horns, puncturing its chest but not killing it. Marik gets bitten by one of the wolves, knocking her out of Wild Shape and unconscious in one go. Nainarv reacts by using Channel Divinity: Preserve Life to push a load of healing energy into her, bringing her back to consciousness.

Now back on his feet, Kera continues working his way through the regular wolves, picking them off with his greatsword as well as killing one with his horns. Vētrall casts Cloud of Daggers on the dire wolf, filling it with daggers that rain from the sky, much to Kera's amazement.

The dire wolf repositions to the side of Kera, missing him with a bite. Marik steps up and casts Thunderwave. While the dire wolf remains on its feet, the blast of thunder energy is enough to rattle its bones and strip the last life from it, its lifeless body collapsing to the floor.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## Farmstead Aftermath

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) lies down in the grass outside of the picket fence, exhausted by the encounter.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) rushes over to [Rowan Stonesworn](../characters/rowan-stonesworn.md)'s body, checking for signs of life. They find a heavily mangled corpse: bite marks all over his face and chest, and flesh stripped from one of his legs. His chest is saturated with blood from lots of teeth puncture wounds. Vētrall fears the worst but holds out hope as [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) rushes over and casts Spare the Dying. In doing so he detects no signs of life, informing Vētrall that they're dead.

While Vētrall lingers for a moment, devastated that someone they were here to protect has died on their watch, Nainarv walks back to their campsite to retrieve his belongings, particularly his warhammer. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) uses Kera's greatsword to attempt to skin the dire wolf's pelt, but accidentally cuts through the skin from underneath, ruining the small amount she'd began to remove. She gives up.

Vētrall spots the open door and decides to check inside. The farmstead is humble and cluttered, boxes and bags of supplies in every corner and on every surface. She spots Kera's silver coin on a bench not far from the front door. They walk the house, in doing so recalling Rowan mention his wife. Vētrall hurriedly searches for her but finds her nowhere. Emerging from the house they check the surrounding area but it is too dark. They return inside, opening up a bedroom dresser to find several dresses that suggest Rowan does indeed have a wife.

Marik carefully moves the body into the house, placing it left of the door between the wall and table. She finds a tablecloth in a nearby cupboard and places it over him gently, though the blood from his chest injuries soon saturate the middle of the sheet.

Thinking on what has just happened, the party decide to catch their breath. Nainarv expresses how cruel life can be that you could meet your end so suddenly, pointing out that it is a common occurrence for adventurers.

*[Everyone: short rest]*

## Lorena Arrives

With the sun now beginning to rise, [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) notices two horses patrolling the forest line nearby. He waves at them, [Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md) waving back, turning towards the farmstead.

On arrival the [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) helps Lorena down from her horse, her plate armour having some minor practical implications when horseback.

She is immediately struck by the scene before her, six dead wolves and one larger dire wolf surrounding her. As [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) begins to mumble about screams in the night and coming to help, Lorena slowly approaches the dire wolf, equal measures of horrified and intrigued at the creature before her.

Vētrall points out that the farmer ([Rowan Stonesworn](../characters/rowan-stonesworn.md)) is dead and his body is inside the house. Lorena goes to the door frame and looks for herself, a mournful look across her face as she lays eyes on the body.

*[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md):*
> Do you know if he had a wife?

*[Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md):*
> Oh. Yes... she was the farmhand that the wolves killed.

The revelation causes great anguish to Vētrall, with a realisation that Rowan's angry response was likely reflexive, the farmer not having yet came to terms with his wife's death. A sombre silence falls across the party for a moment, including Lorena who feels great shame at not being strong enough to help these poor farmers.

Cutting through the silence, Lorena eventually remarks that she ought to pay the party what they've done. Kera suggests they can handle pay when they all return to [the Nasty Huntress](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-nasty-huntress.md), but Lorena informs him that she will need to stay here and handle the situation. She thanks the party for what they've done, struggling to sound sincere through her lingering shock at the scene before her.

[Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md) adds 1 platinum coin to her reward pouch as a personal thanks, but doesn't point this out. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) is given a coin pouch containing 1pp 40 gp, giving [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) 12 gp 5 sp each as their share of the takings. Vētrall asks Nainarv if he'd like a cut, but Nainarv asks Vētrall to give his share to the family ([Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md)).

Lorena again asks the party for their names. Kera points out that she has already asked them once today. Lorena is apologetic, stating that she forgot. Kera eyes her over suspiciously but finds no ill intent. Marik is also suspicious, able to glean that Lorena is scared, unfamiliar with such death and tragedy.

Lorena tries to be encouraging, pointing out that the work the party have done will ensure that nobody else has to die in [Sonnigeweide](../places/villages/sonnigeweide.md), so they should be proud of that at least. She offers hospitality if they're ever in [Golfmaul](../places/towns/golfmaul.md) again, instructing them to seek the [Waldwächters](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) on their arrival and she will ensure they are well looked after.

## Onwards to [Dünnesland](../places/towns/dunnesland.md)

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) asks the party if they should return to [Golfmaul](../places/towns/golfmaul.md) so they can continue on to [Hochwald](../places/cities/hochwald.md). [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) suggests that they can head onwards directly from here. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) checks their map (The [Independent States of the Nil'Savnic Alliance](../maps/independent-states-of-the-nilsavnic-alliance.md)), finding that there is a trail between [Sonnigeweide](../places/villages/sonnigeweide.md) and [Dünnesland](../places/towns/dunnesland.md).

Nainarv tries to lift the group's spirits by expressing excitement for [Dünnesland](../places/towns/dunnesland.md), a spring in his step as he begins leading the group east. When questioned about what he's excited for, he describes it as the best place for beer in the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md), and an excellent place to party. The party are keen to have such an experience after a miserable night.

Nainarv leads on until late afternoon when the party get their first glimpse of [Dünnesland](../places/towns/dunnesland.md), the walled city visible beyond [Niere Lake](../places/rivers-lakes/niere-lake.md), with the [Gulf of Tanelle](../places/seas-oceans/gulf-of-tanelle.md) visible either side of the walls. Six rectangular towers raise above the walls, two of which are notably taller than the others. Nainarv is excited, asking the others if they're ready to drink, which is positively received.

## Der Bierstadt

The party make their way past [Niere Lake](../places/rivers-lakes/niere-lake.md), briefly rejoining [Lilaweg](../places/roads/lilaweg.md) as it enters [Dünnesland](../places/towns/dunnesland.md) through its southern gate. Here they spot a few stables and cart trade buildings before the gatehouse itself, which is flanked by two [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) on each side, each holding a large pike.

Heading inside the main street is bustling with citizens, traders, and revellers alike. A trader woman selling blackberries at her stall waves at Nainarv, greeting him warmly:

*Trader:*
> Wilkommen in der Bierstadt!

*[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md):*
> Danke, guten abend!

After returning the friendly greeting, Nainarv turns to the party, asking whether they prefer their beer strong and flavourful or traditional and subtle. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) is first to speak up, opting for the former. Nainarv then asks if they wish to drink somewhere with a party atmosphere or somewhere more cultured. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) feel it is best to experience the authentic party atmosphere.

Nainarv decides to take the party to [The Brew's Lair](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-brews-lair.md) first, informing the party before leading them through the streets of [Dünnesland](../places/towns/dunnesland.md).

Along the way the party pass a town crier who shouts the day's news:

> Murder in [Kulevi](../places/towns/kulevi.md)!  
> An orcish husband and wife were found dead in a back alley behind Ewe Street.  
> The [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md) suspect foul play, blaming the infamous crime syndicate, The [Hammersmiths](../organisations/criminals/hammersmiths.md).

> The [Bay of Splendour](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/bay-of-splendour.md) launches new ships!  
> The first of a new generation of naval ships were launched from Utsera. A festival was held to commemorate the Bidza class ships.  
> Mparveli, the flagship, will be put straight to work keeping the coasts of the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) safe.

## Drinking [Dragonbrew](../organisations/business/dragonbrew.md)

The party enters [The Brew's Lair](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-brews-lair.md). As [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) leads the others deeper inside, [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) is in awe of the adult dragon skeleton hanging from the roof, a sight unfamiliar to most. Kera asks what the dragon's story was, Nainarv replying that it is a long story, and one he doesn't know all the details of.

Settling at a table near the back right of the room, Nainarv wastes no time ordering drinks. Remembering that Kera wanted to drink something strong, a round of Black Dragons are ordered. The barmaid offers to open a tab, Nainarv agreeing. When she prompts him to provide collateral, he produces his [Coin of Family](../items/coins/coin-of-family.md), which she takes.

Vētrall questions this, asking if Nainarv is worried that he won't get it back. Nainarv is aloof, implying that this is a trustworthy place, and stating that he could get a replacement if he lost it. Kera questions whether he's lost his coin before, Nainarv denying it. Kera tries to detect a lie but finds none.

As everyone begins to drink, Nainarv feints an eager sip, watching as the others down their first mouthful. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) are quickly taken by the strength of the sticky stout, a wave of intoxication hitting them immediately. Kera is unaffected. Nainarv chuckles before downing his drink in one go.

Vētrall comments on the tavern's music, the band playing on a small stage to the back not to their liking. They call the music derivative and uninspiring, an insult to their ears, the safe background ambiance not adventurous enough for the ambitious musician. When Vētrall wonders if they could possibly take over, Nainarv strongly cautions them against doing so, stating that this is a place that wouldn't be receptive to a change of routine.

When Nainarv points out that they could go somewhere after this where the music is livelier, the party sign on to his idea of turning this into a pub crawl.

Nainarv orders more drinks for the party, ordering the three remaining beers for everyone without asking. As their time here continues, Kera and Vētrall in particular work their way through the drinks, Nainarv drinking whatever the others don't want.

## A Familiar Blue Dragonborn

Almost immediately after sitting down, [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) spots [Thelraar Avrae](../characters/thelraar-avrae.md) sat at the Blue Dragon table near the centre of the room. As soon as she meets her gaze, the blue dragonborn glances over, a look of shock and terror overtaking her face. She tries to bury herself in her drink but Marik is already aware that she noticed her. Marik doesn't immediately recognise who she is, but finds her familiar.

After the first round of drinks, Marik looks again, once again spooking Avrae who knocks over her drink onto the table while trying to act nonchalant.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) notices Marik distracted by something else and asks her what's going on. Marik points out the blue dragonborn, who Kera also finds familiar. Collectively the pair realise that they have crossed paths with Avrae before, a criminal who was holding [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) in [Murkwallow](../places/cities/murkwallow.md). The pair discuss the potential of danger, initially fearing that another of the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) is here to claim the bounty on them. They think on their original encounter with her, questioning which organisation she is part of, considering if she was part of a rival syndicate like the [Hammersmiths](../organisations/criminals/hammersmiths.md).

Kera opts for a direct approach, getting up from the table and walking over to speak with Avrae himself. As he approaches the dragon tables in the middle of the room, every chromatic dragonborn stares at him judgementally as he breaks an unspoken rule - only appropriately coloured dragonborn and bar staff in the middle of the room. As he reaches the table, a blue dragonborn male rises to confront him.

Kera responds to the dragonborn that he is here to talk with [Thelraar Avrae](../characters/thelraar-avrae.md), looking in her direction. She panics, shooting up from her chair and rushing for the front door, seeking to escape. As she goes she knocks over two chairs and bumps into a barmaid who drops a tray holding two drinks. Kera gives chase, dodging the obstacles as he pursues her. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md), seeing the case begin, rushes after the pair. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) stay put, casually enjoying their drinks, not wanting to get involved.

Avrae reaches the front door which is opening, dashing through it. She is surprised to find two patrons entering the tavern, colliding with them. She falls forward into a roll, landing on her back. Kera reaches the door at around the same time, finding her lying in the street.

*[Thelraar Avrae](../characters/thelraar-avrae.md):*
> Go on then, make it quick.

Confusion breaks out as Kera asks what Avrae means. She spells it out - that she believes Kera and Marik are here to kill her. It becomes clear that Kera thought that Avrae was here to kill them, mentioning the bounty. Avrae has no idea what he is talking about.

Kera seeks answers, asking if Avrae is a skimmer. She is dismissive, pointing out that she is only here because she is trying to leave her criminal life behind. Kera asks who she worked for, but Avrae won't tell, stating it is no longer relevant. Marik offers to let her go if she talks, prompting a sigh and acquiescence as she confirms the pair's suspicion that she was a member of the [Hammersmiths](../organisations/criminals/hammersmiths.md).

The pair ask more about her time as a criminal, it becoming increasingly clear that Avrae fled her criminal ties as it wasn't worth the risk to her life, and that she was too nervous to excel. She is asked about why she was protecting [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md), Avrae surprised that they hadn't figured out for themselves that a songbird from a rival organisation knows lots of secrets, so the [Hammersmiths](../organisations/criminals/hammersmiths.md) stole them from the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md).

Satisfied with what they've learned, Kera allows [Thelraar Avrae](../characters/thelraar-avrae.md) to leave. She walks away down the street, checking the pair aren't about to change their minds before she ducks into a side street, vanishing into the night.

As Kera heads back to the party's table, he is confronted by an angry barmaid who Avrae ran into. She insists that Kera pays for the damages, which he is more than happy to do, apologising for causing a scene. The barmaid learns which table he is with, adding the cost of the drinks and a bit extra for the rule breaking to their tab. Kera helps pick up the chairs as he makes his way back across the room, the eyes of every dragonborn in its middle fixed on him.

Once the party reconvene at their table, the last of their drinks are consumed. Nainarv drank Marik's Red Dragon while she was away, suggesting to Vētrall that she would probably be thankful for the help.

With a good sample of [Dragonbrew](../organisations/business/dragonbrew.md) taken, Nainarv pays the party's tab, collects his [Coin of Family](../items/coins/coin-of-family.md), and leads the party back outside.

## Pub Crawling

[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) leads the party to the north of [Dünnesland](../places/towns/dunnesland.md), headed for [Ziegenturm](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/ziegenturm.md). He explains that their destination sells more nuanced, traditional dwarven ales, and [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) may prefer the music and atmosphere of this tavern.

Right before a small courtyard opens out, the base of the second highest tower appears to the right of the street, a church-like vaulted roof stretching along the right hand side of the road away from it. Nainarv leads the party inside.

The party is met with a long room filled with benches and pews, three rows that stretch from front to back away from the entrance. The atmosphere is much more lively with people, predominantly dwarves, sloshing their large tankards around and even dancing on the tables, which polka music is played by a band on a small stage in the room's very centre.

Looking up, the large quantity of dwarven blades suspended from the rafters become a source of worry for the party. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) points out how delicate the strings holding them up look, noticing one that isn't well secured. Nainarv suggests that the precarious nature of the blades is part of the thrill of being here, the threat of injury or death a reminder of how fleeting life can be.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) goes to the bar to order but finds the bartender only speaks [Valburgisch](../languages/valburgisch.md). Nainarv steps in, ordering for the party:

*Nainarv:*
> Zwei Schneedecke und zwei Dunklerwald, bitte.

Drinks are passed out, with Nainarv and Kera drinking the heavier schwarzbier while [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and Marik drink the lighter wheat beer.

## Chaos in the Streets

While the party enjoy their first drink in [Ziegenturm](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/ziegenturm.md) and settle in, [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) hear the sound of screaming coming from the street outside. They immediately opt to investigate, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) choosing to follow them as they head for the entrance suddenly. [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) uses the opportunity to order his second beer at the bar.

Emerging into the street, the pair spot three citizens emerging from a street that enters into the small market square to the right as they exit. They are looking backwards and shouting in terror, running past the pair, deeper into [Dünnesland](../places/towns/dunnesland.md).

*Citizens:*
> Schnell! Schnell!

The ground begins to rumble as Vētrall arrives outside, a rhythm becoming apparent that suggests something big is coming. As the party looks across the marketplace and brace for what might come, they witness a large building cornerstone come flying from the same street, hurtling across the marketplace as it arcs through the air.

The cornerstone crashes through one of [Ziegenturm](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/ziegenturm.md)'s stained glass windows, impacting the sides of the window frame's stonework as it goes. The glass is blown out almost entirely, a loud shattering sound covering the following sound of the stone crashing into the interior beyond.

Almost immediately the sound of the tavern's crowds screaming and panicking can be heard while the horrific realisation of what just happened begins to set in with the party. A large crowd of revellers were just subjected to a large, heavy, and fast moving object.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) wastes no time trying to return into the building, but as he reaches the front door, a flood of patrons begins to pour out from the room, looking to get out and to safety. Kera tries to push in but is forced back by the mindless crowd. He shouts for Nainarv who soon appears between them, moving over to the side when he sees Kera.

*[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md):*
> We've got to get in there and help everyone!

*[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md):*
> I think we've got bigger problems out here...

From across the marketplace an ettin emerges, carrying two large crude weapons. It swings its greatclub at the corner of a building as it goes, dislodging and shattering several cornerstones which crumble to the ground. The sight of such a large and monstrous humanoid puts a strong fear into the party.

As the patrons disperse from the building, they run in every direction, some of which run into the marketplace blindly. Marik and Vētrall try to shout at them to go the other way, but most continue onwards. One crosses the marketplace and runs directly towards the ettin, not noticing it until it is too late. It swings its greatclub down at the human, crushing its head, spine and pelvis in a single shattering blow that leaves only a crumpled and lifeless body indented into the street's cobbles. The other nearby people who are fleeing turn around and run back towards [Ziegenturm](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/ziegenturm.md) in terror.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) catches the ettin shouting angrily in giant with its limited vocabulary:

*Ettin:*
> Stupid!

As the party consider their next move, they spot a kenku ([Updraft](../characters/updraft.md)) emerge on the roof of [Ziegenturm](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/ziegenturm.md), his grey and white trimmed robes fluttering in the breeze. With one hand on the top of the roof he leans, shouting to everyone below in a wealthy sounding voice that sounds like his own, rather than a collection of memorised snippets:

*[Updraft](../characters/updraft.md):*
> Fear not, citizens, for I am here to help you!
