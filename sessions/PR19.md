## [Sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) Day 1

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) seeks to practice drawing her Rune Knight runes, but has no carving or writing materials. She rings the bell in their [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) quarters, summoning [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) into the room.

Torbra asks if something can be brought to relieve their boredom. Garrick agrees to bring writing materials and dice for playing [Twenties](../mechanics/roleplay/twenties.md) with. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) remarks that she doesn't know how to play. Saoirse persuades Garrick to bring the party alcohol. He agrees to provide some with their evening meal.

Garrick remarks that his back is sore already from sitting in the chair all night. He leaves.

After 10 minutes the party hears footsteps in the building and up the stairs. Some of the party realises that this is Garrick's guards attending to his needs.

## Visitors: [Carras Southroot](../characters/carras-southroot.md) and [Norsha Costello](../characters/norsha-costello.md)

### 12:00

After the faint sound of arguing from outside, the bell is rang and visitors enter. [Carras Southroot](../characters/carras-southroot.md) enters first, visibly nervous and unwilling to speak, before [Norsha Costello](../characters/norsha-costello.md) enters behind him.

Norsha introduces them both before Carras explains that as the [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) in charge of [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), he is here to ask about the circumstances of [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md)'s disappearance. It becomes clear that Norsha is furious that Carras hasn't had a good handle on his squad's activities or whereabouts.

Norsha suggests that Carras will be responsible for finding Wrenn and bringing him back to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). They are more interested in why Wrenn was in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) in the first place, as [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) was based out of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) and had an active mission at the time.

Saoirse gives a truthful explanation that [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) hired the party to locate the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) for him and that they fled [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) together after getting into trouble. When Norsha presses for more specifics, Saoirse explains that Wrenn investigating [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md)'s disappearance got them all into trouble with the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

Norsha remarks that Wrenn has been sticking his nose in a lot of other people's business. When Saoirse explains that the party is here to try and retrieve [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) before he reaches [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), Norsha suggests that [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) is looking into the matter.

Using Carras' copy of a [Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../papers/maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md), [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) shows that Wrenn was captured by bandits slightly east of [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md), who then took off to the east. Norsha and Carras confer, suggesting that the bandits likely travelled away via the [Northern Road](../places/roads/northern-road.md).

Norsha asks about the bandits. Thanea conveys to the pair that a half-orc called [Morog Whiteknuckle](../characters/morog-whiteknuckle.md) of [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) took Wrenn to settle a debt he had with them. Norsha and Carras confer again, Carras suggests that [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) are known around Carnmere.

Thanea puts a point on Wrenn's adventures having made their life difficult. Norsha assures the party that if/when he is found, Carras will be keeping a much closer eye on him.

Saoirse attempts to convince Norsha to seek compensation for her for being attacked by the bandits. Norsha asks her name, her god, and flippantly suggests she prays to them if she wants compensation for a bandit attack on a road.

Norsha explains that if Wrenn can't be found, [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) is down an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) and a reorganisation of some squads will need to happen.

Norsha tells Carras that it's time to leave, and that he should summon [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) as the 3 of them need to have a chat. The pair leaves.

## Between Visitors

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) suggests that the party creates hand signals for silently communicating in combat. The idea goes nowhere.

There is some discussion of [Carras Southroot](../characters/carras-southroot.md), mostly bewilderment that someone so small and timid could be an [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md). Thanea is not surprised if people like Wrenn exist, and finds the entire premise of the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) ridiculous. Saoirse likens it to a prison. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) can't understand why [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) is suffering as well.

## Visitor: [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md)

### 14:00

The bell rings and in steps [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) wearing his usual officer [Astorrel robes](../organisations/astorrel/uniforms/astorrel-robes.md).

*[Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md):*

> I come bearing gifts.

Mergin pulls items out of his pockets, struggling as he goes. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) helps. He pulls out:

- A pot of ink, quill, 6 sheets of paper.
- [Twenties](../mechanics/roleplay/twenties.md) dice: 2x d20, 6x d6.

He forwardly asks the party how they got past the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md). They lie, telling him that they went through one of the wall's gatehouses. Mergin calls it a bold move and voices his approval, suggesting that the party must be capable and able to outrun many [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md).

He brings up what he has heard about [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) going down during their chase. Saoirse suggests that danger of that kind is part of the job description. Mergin exclaims that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) deaths has made his day very interesting, telling the party this with glee.

Mergin almost forgets the paper he still has in this pocket, producing it and handing it to Saoirse: [Northhaven Town Crier Script 312-5-06](../papers/letters/northhaven-town-crier-script-312-5-06.md). He introduces it as today's news, feeling that the party may wish to see it.

| Character | Can Read? |
| --- |:---:|
| [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | Yes |
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | Yes |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | Yes |
| [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) | No |

As Torbra reads the paper out loud to the group, [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) corrects her as she mispronounces his surname, using it as an opportunity to introduce himself.

Mergin suggests that everyone in the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md) is talking about the party by now and asks them what it feels like to be famous. Thanea still feels like they are being hunted, while Torbra doesn't feel free. Mergin responds with a look of accepting agreement.

Prompted by Garrick, Mergin offers to teach the group how to play [Twenties](../mechanics/roleplay/twenties.md), taking his time to slowly sit at the coffee table. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Thanea offer to play. Mergin places 2 gp on the table as coin to wager. Mergin plays, rolling an 11 and then rolling 2x d6 to total 19. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) has a go, immediately rolling a natural 20. Mergin is astonished, revelling in the absurdity of the roll. He responds by placing 8 gp more on the table (10 gp total) for the group to use as gambling money to keep themselves entertained.

Mergin excuses himself, attempting to stand up, needing [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s help to stand. He wishes them well, hoping they'll at least have some fun while stuck in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

## Between Visitors

### 15:00

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks if anyone wants to play [Twenties](../mechanics/roleplay/twenties.md). Saoirse and Thanea choose to play while Torbra moves aside to conduct [Rune Knight practice](../mechanics/roleplay/rune-knight-practice.md).

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) chooses to practice the Stone Rune. Eventually Saoirse joins her, watching curiously and without interrupting.

| Stone Rune DC | Roll | Success? |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 20 | 18 | No |
| 18 | 1 | No |
| 16 | 6 | No |

### 17:00

The evening's meal is served along with a pitcher of ale which [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) was able to procure at Saoirse's request. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) opts to get water from the tap in the bathroom. Torbra snatches Saoirse's ale from her, causing her to close herself in the bathroom in a huff.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks Torbra to teach her how to read. With an Intelligence check of (unnatural) 20 she begins to recognise some of the words on the town crier script.

Saoirse emerges from the bathroom to grab her food and the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) before heading back inside. In retaliation [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) flips the coffee table and props it against the door, trying to wedge the table under the door handle, damaging the edge of the table in the process. Saoirse is aware that someone is trying to lock her in.

*[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*

> Well fuck you too!

When everyone goes to sleep, Saoirse sneaks out of the bathroom to grab her bedding, stuffing it into the bathtub and sleeping there.

*[Long rest]*

### 09:00

It is raining heavily outside for the first time in the campaign. The sky is grey.

When food arrives [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) saves some of the seeds from the fruit to play with. Saoirse remains in the bathroom and doesn't eat. Thanea brings her food to the bathroom for her, leaving it inside. Saoirse nods in acceptance but doesn't speak.

Torbra teaches [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) to read some more. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) has lost some of her knowledge from the day before, but is beginning to learn some of the letter sounds. She can't read without talking out loud.

## Visitor: [Rowan Great Sile](../characters/rowan-great-sile.md)

### 12:00

The bell rings, announcing [Rowan Great Sile](../characters/rowan-great-sile.md) who comes to visit. Saoirse is still isolating herself in the bathroom when he arrives, though she hears the bell.

Rowan immediately sees [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and says hi, while she greets him with cries of "brother!". He introduces himself by name and as part of the Great Sile Clan, and states his intention to get to know more about her.

She mentions her exile from her clan and [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md)'s capture. Rowan is remorseful, asking about her clan, but [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is happy with the life her and her father normally lead.

Rowan tells [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) that she's the first firbolg he has seen in a while, and that he doesn't come across many since he left his clan. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) explains that Rowan is the first other firbolg she has seen in over 100 years, since being exiled. Rowan is impressed by her age, noting his age is around 80.

Rowan asks [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) where her clan is from. She explains that she's from the north part of the [Hawkswood](../places/forests/hawkswood.md). Rowan is at least aware there may be a clan in that area. He lists where the firbolg clans of Astor are that he knows of:

- [Great Sile Woods](../places/forests/great-sile-woods.md).
- [Tulligwood](../places/forests/tulligwood.md) near [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md).
- [Hawkswood](../places/forests/hawkswood.md).

He continues to explain that there isn't much contact between the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and the firbolg clans. Instead the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) keep an eye on them from a distance.

Rowan candidly conveys his excitement at meeting another firbolg, his main motivation for his visit, a prospect he couldn't resist. He remarks that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s blue skin is a lovely colour on a firbolg, a remark that garners giggles from [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Thanea.

Before leaving, Rowan wishes that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) would visit him when their [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) situation is resolved. He notes that he works here in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) under the Major of Forests ([Mindira Flibfae](../characters/mindira-flibfae.md)), trying to do some good and help his fellow firbolgs any way he can. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is receptive to the idea.

When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) mentions that if they leave [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) they'll be kicked out of the stronghold, Rowan heavily implies that may not be the case, hinting that rumours are going around at the moment. When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks for more specifics, Rowan tells her that all of the [Astorrel Majors](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-major.md) have been called for a meeting regarding firbolgs.

Realising that he'd not acknowledged Torbra or Thanea, Rowan nods at them embarrassed before leaving.

After he leaves, Torbra and Thanea poke fun at [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), enjoying how oblivious she is that Rowan seemed to have a thing for her.

## The Rest of the Day

### 12:30

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) comments on how strange it is that people can come to visit freely.

Torbra resumes her [Rune Knight practice](../mechanics/roleplay/rune-knight-practice.md):

| Stone Rune DC | Roll | Success? |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 14 | 2 | No |
| 12 | 16 | Yes |

Torbra gains an intuitive understanding of what makes the rune "correct", particularly the variable thickness of the lines which tapers with each stroke. As she successfully completes the Stone Rune, the lines almost appear to sink into the page, an orange-brown glow beginning to emanate from between the page and where the lines have sunken to. Torbra has an indescribable feeling of success wash over her before the lines snap back to the page, the anti-magic field of [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) asserting itself and ending the effect.

*[[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) unlocks the ability to create the Stone Rune at will]*

As the rune returns to normal, the excited look on her face is replaced with a loud "fuck!".

Prompted by the loud swear, [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) rings the bell and then enters the room. He is visibly tired and shaken, concerned for the party. Torbra dismisses it as nothing, causing him to repeatedly say "okay" while leaving the room.

Thanea expresses worry that Garrick won't be willing to sit in front of their [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) quarters much longer judging by his state, and that they should begin to plan what to do next. Nobody has any ideas. Torbra feels that they need to be ready to defend themselves. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) doesn't expect anyone to come into their quarters forcibly.

Thanea questions what [Rowan Great Sile](../characters/rowan-great-sile.md) said about being able to leave [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) without being kicked out of the stronghold, wondering if it is true. She is perplexed by the complicated and opaque rules governing everything.

### Later

The rest of the day unfolds without further visitors.

Saoirse continues to keep to herself in the bathroom. At one point [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) needs to use the bathroom. Saoirse begrudgingly leaves, clutching the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) while she waits outside the door. Torbra asks why she "holds the orb like a baby", to which Saoirse expresses her attachment to it, suggesting that she likes it more than the rest of the party.

Torbra makes the point again that it's weird behaviour. Thanea defends Saoirse, pointing out that [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) feels the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) is important and needs protecting, and that the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) is likely their only bargaining chip right now. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is concerned that Saoirse might not let go of it if it comes to that. Thanea agrees that the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) is important. Saoirse says that she just wants to protect it.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) turns on the tap in the bathtub, soaking Saoirse's bedding. Saoirse immediately goes back inside and turns off the tap. Once everyone is asleep she changes her bedding for a dry set. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) sets up her bed inside of the cupboard, moody that Saoirse doesn't like her as much as the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md).

*[Long rest]*

## A Letter Arrives

### 09:00

With the morning meal a letter arrives addressed to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), with a turquoise wax seal of the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) keeping it closed. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) opens the [Letter to Wizira from Levelle Tristwix](../papers/letters/letter-to-wizira-from-levelle-tristwix.md), passing it to Torbra who reads it out loud.

When Torbra explains that [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) is to be conscripted into the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) retorts that he doesn't know any harmful magic.

Torbra rings the bell, summoning [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md), who looks well rested this morning. Torbra asks if he knows how long the offer of [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) will last. She explains that she feels the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) are too tied up in politics with the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) over [the firbolg controversy](../storylines/the-firbolg-controversy.md) and if they don't act soon, [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) will be conscripted, making his rescue much harder.

Garrick notes that [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) is visiting again today with someone else and that they are best placed to help the party. He offers to bring Torbra more paper. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks for a small plant, which Garrick is hesitant to promise but agrees to try and source.

## Visitor: [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md)

### 09:30

Elysia returns. She immediately notes Saoirse's absence. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) points out that she's in the bathroom. When Elysia knocks on the door and demands that she comes out, Saoirse refuses but invites her in. Elysia enters, closing the door behind her. Saoirse exclaims that she's not a threat, to which Elysia retorts that she's not worried about her.

Elysia tells Saoirse that she might be able to help the party, and tries to encourage her to come out. When she refuses, Elysia gets annoyed and opens the door, leaning against the door frame so that she can talk to both Saoirse and everyone else at once.

Elysia informs the party that [the firbolg controversy](../storylines/the-firbolg-controversy.md) is going to trial according to rumours in the [Zenith Spire](../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md). She isn't sure what the stakes are yet but expects that to be figured out shortly.

She conveys her desire to use what remaining political pull she has to get the party close to [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) should the trial be won by the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), so that they may help her squad with the work they have been doing to uncover [the meteoric threat](../storylines/the-meteoric-threat.md). She asks the party if they would be interested, to which they respond in a non-committal manner.

Elysia sets out her vision for what she'd like to happen ideally. She'd like the party to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) as a squad, working alongside [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md). She is particularly keen due to how capable they've proven themselves to be at acquiring the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) and killing [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md). She isn't able to make any promises.

She seeks the party's words that they will continue to keep quiet about [the meteoric threat](../storylines/the-meteoric-threat.md). [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) reminds Elysia that they've kept quiet so far. Satisfied, she hands the pouch of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to the party, explaining that she lock picked the chest to retrieve it after distracting [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) at night.

Keen not to be seen when [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) arrives, Elysia departs in a hurry.

Once she leaves, the party wonders why Elysia placed so much value on the pouch and the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) by extension. She suggests playing dumb and going along with it for now.

## Visitors: [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) and [Mindira Flibfae](../characters/mindira-flibfae.md)

### 13:00

[Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) enters the room first. She asks [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) if she got her letter.

[Mindira Flibfae](../characters/mindira-flibfae.md) enters the room before Levelle has a chance to explain. She excitedly greets the party, bursting with positive energy at her task at hand, getting carried away before Levelle focuses her attention.

She explains that the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) have decided to bring [the firbolg controversy](../storylines/the-firbolg-controversy.md) to trial, that she is here to inform the party of the specifics and to gather any useful information that will help with their case.

Levelle provides more information:

- Trial between [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).
- Trial in 4 days.
- [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) expected to give testimony.
- The party and [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) put up as stakes. Winner takes all.

Torbra is in disbelief at the stakes. Levelle assures her that the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) believe they have a strong case, particularly with the story of [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md).

Mindira introduces herself as the Major of Forests and begins gathering information about [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) and firbolgs. She asks the rest of the party if they have anything useful. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) explains that they can testify on the way the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) have treated them. Thanea points out they can also testify to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s affinity for nature.

When Thanea mentions that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) acts more like an animal when affected by Wild Shape, Mindira suggests that a practical demonstration is in order before the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) pin all of their hopes on one firbolg. Mindira mentions [Rowan Great Sile](../characters/rowan-great-sile.md) in relation to this, confirming with [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) that she can indeed turn into animals.

Mindira illustrates a need not only to prepare their talking points in the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) favour, but also to anticipate what the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) will argue. Levelle points out that they've heard that the [Astornox Captain](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-captain.md) of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) is coming to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) for the trial.

Mindira pulls out a book and writing implements from her pack, sits on the floor, and prepares to record notes. She asks [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) to go back to the start and explain how her father disappeared.
