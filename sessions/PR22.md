## Downtime

### 10:00

Following [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s graduation, the party is led back into the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) via the tunnels underneath the [Zenith Spire](../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md).

With the [Nature's Battle](../storylines/natures-battle.md) tournament not starting until tomorrow, the party have the rest of the day at their disposal to do with as they wish.

## Retail Therapy

### Weapons

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) wanted to find somewhere to sell some of her items. The rest of the party decide to come with. Wandering back towards [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md), they are directed to Crafter's Course as the place to buy and sell.

Torbra enters [Rhotrukk Wepons](../places/buildings/shops/rhotrukk-wepons.md) with the intent to sell her maul. Both her and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) spend some time rummaging through the haphazard collection of weapons for sale. Torbra approaches [Rhotrukk Bone Bleeder](../characters/rhotrukk-bone-bleeder.md) and asks if he'd buy her maul. He offers 6 gp, Torbra counters with 8 gp, which he accepts. Torbra places the maul in the weapon racks as instructed. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tries to sell him her shovel but gets nowhere.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) searches for somewhere to sell her shovel. She enters [Everything Else](../places/buildings/shops/everything-else.md) and attempts to sell it to [Nilus Cray](../characters/nilus-cray.md). He offers 1 gp which she accepts. Thanea asks if he'd buy her crossbow. He makes an offer but also directs her back to [Rhotrukk Wepons](../places/buildings/shops/rhotrukk-wepons.md). [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) judges Nilus to be sad, but looking closer she finds an intensely boring person.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) eventually makes her way back to [Rhotrukk Wepons](../places/buildings/shops/rhotrukk-wepons.md), selling her crossbow for 23 gp and darts for 5 sp.

### Clothes

Saoirse looks for a clothing store, attempting to find tired common looking clothes. After half an hour she comes across [Margaret's Fineries](../places/buildings/shops/margarets-fineries.md). Asking [Margaret Solvay](../characters/margaret-solvay.md) for common clothes, she is judged harshly, Margaret suggesting she finds somewhere in the [Sunrise District](../places/districts/sunrise-district.md). Saoirse is quick to point out to her the lost sales from someone with 100 gp at their disposal.

Later in the afternoon, Saoirse heads to the [Sunrise District](../places/districts/sunrise-district.md) to find a clothing store.

When passing through the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) gatehouse she is heckled by the [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) who was pursuing the party after they emerged from the sewers. His interactions with her are amicable, merely making his presence known and acknowledging her new [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) rank.

Saoirse eventually finds a rough and ready clothing store. Greeted by a young man in his [twenties](../mechanics/roleplay/twenties.md), she inquires about buying clothes to make her look more boyish. He is able to provide her common clothes in a masculine style including a flat cap for 5 sp 2 cp, which she gladly pays.

After leaving the store, Saoirse heads further to the [Sunrise District](../places/districts/sunrise-district.md)'s outskirts, looking for a beggar. She finds a woman looking after two children who are playing in the street. She is apprehensive to talk to a stranger, but her face lights up when Saoirse hands her the second slice of chocolate cake. At first doubtful that something so brown could be edible, the woman takes a taste, liking it so much that she calls the children over, with whom she shares the cake. Saoirse then hands her an amount of sp and cp, causing her to sob. She clasps her hands around Saoirse's, declaring her an angel. Saoirse tells her that she reminds her of her mother. With the coin pocketed, the woman ushers the children to follow her, and they quickly disappear into an alley, obviously wary of people taking their new found money.

Saoirse passes back through the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md), her [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) badge checked as she goes. As she was pushy trying to get in, the [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) quiz her on her assignment, but she fails to remember the specifics of [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md). When the guards refuse her access, the [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) from before instructs his guards to let her pass.

Somewhere along the way, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) pays 1 sp for a head band to pin her [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) badge to.

## Sending Letters

### [Sunset Delivery Astor Square](../places/buildings/shops/sunset-delivery-astor-square.md)

Saoirse looks for somewhere to send a letter from. Asking a random passer by in [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md), they point her over to [Sunset Delivery Astor Square](../places/buildings/shops/sunset-delivery-astor-square.md). There is a queue out of the door. Saoirse attempts to use her [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) rank to skip the queue out of a sense of importance, but is stopped in the doorway by an irate female dwarf who tells her to fuck off.

The scene Saoirse is causing causes two [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) ([Log in the Crimson Forest](../characters/log-in-the-crimson-forest.md) and [Cedrick Doolahan](../characters/cedrick-doolahan.md)) to come over to see what is happening. While this is happening, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tries to get the queue of people to take bets on who will win, only managing to strike conversation with one person, [Gregor Primrose](../characters/gregor-primrose.md). He chuckles with [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), indicates that he thinks the dwarf will win, and states he is here to send a package. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) informs him that he knows Saoirse, which he finds humorous.

Saoirse tries to convince the guards that she has an important letter to send to the [Ulburn Astorrel House](../places/buildings/ulburn-astorrel-house.md). Log responds incredulously, suggesting she should have gone to [Astpost Northhaven](../places/buildings/shops/astpost-northhaven.md) instead. Saoirse retorts that she's new and doesn't know anything. She makes a point of taking their names so that she may note their usefulness. With this, the situation is diffused, and Saoirse makes her way to [Astpost Northhaven](../places/buildings/shops/astpost-northhaven.md).

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks [Gregor Primrose](../characters/gregor-primrose.md) about how to get a message to someone. He explains that you send a letter, before recognising her as the blue firbolg from the news. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) wants to send a letter to Heather Pentz, which Gregor says should be doable with the business name and settlement. He offers to write the letter for her, and asks her to join him in line. She pays 1 sp for the writing supplies and he gets him to write a letter to Heather, catching her up on the events since [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) last saw her in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), as well as the forthcoming [Nature's Battle](../storylines/natures-battle.md) tournament. She pays the 1 gp fee to send the letter. Gregor wishes her well as they part ways.

## Enjoying a Drink

[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) seeks somewhere to enjoy a well earned drink. She comes across [Valley Under the Stars](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/valley-under-the-stars.md) and chooses to enter. [Zarrus Maleron](../characters/zarrus-maleron.md) greets her and offers her a table in the dining area. She orders two slices of the chocolate cake (5 sp each) and an Eaglesfield whiskey (10 gp) for 11 gp total. She eats and drinks without social graces, catching glances from the other patrons who quietly leave her be. She takes the last piece of cake to go.

## Seeking Knowledge

### [Adventures for Adventurers](../places/buildings/shops/adventures-for-adventurers.md)

Torbra searches for a library of some sort. She heads back to [Adventures for Adventurers](../places/buildings/shops/adventures-for-adventurers.md), remembering seeing books in it earlier. She speaks to the owner, [Tarsha Nulas](../characters/tarsha-nulas.md), asking her if she has any books about runes, producing her [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) badge to answer any questions about why she might be looking for information about magic. Tarsha takes this as an opportunity to relate to her [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) rank, once having been a squad hand herself. When Torbra alludes to the exceptional circumstances in which she joined the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), Tarsha clocks her as being part of the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) trail of the firbolg conspiracy.

She helps Torbra look for any books that might be useful, producing [Magicborn and Magical Phenomena](../items/books/magicborn-and-magical-phenomena.md) for her. Tarsha allows her to flick through it, finding it to be encyclopedic, with little useful learned with a cursory glance.

Torbra asks Tarsha if she's ever heard of glowing rocks before, explaining the runes she found along the banks of the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md). Tarsha has no idea, but points her to [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md). When Tarsha asks if she'd like to buy the book, Torbra buys it for the haggled down price of 1 gp 5 sp, providing she returns to tell her the story of the runes.

### [Friend of the Magicborn](../places/buildings/shops/friend-of-the-magicborn.md)

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) decides to see what's inside [Friend of the Magicborn](../places/buildings/shops/friend-of-the-magicborn.md), heading inside and meeting [Moss Under the Crumbling Cliffs](../characters/moss-under-the-crumbling-cliffs.md). Thanea greets Moss and explains that she's a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), asking what she sells.

*[Moss Under the Crumbling Cliffs](../characters/moss-under-the-crumbling-cliffs.md):*

> Nothing for you.

Thanea decides to leave immediately.

### [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md)

As the party regroups to check out [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md), they pass back into the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md)'s gate house for the first time. As new [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) they are examined more thoroughly but ultimately let in.

Upon arriving, [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md) helps the party locate books that might be of use for their research.

#### [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md): Earth Genasi

Torbra is shown to [Humanoids and Rare Varieties](../items/books/humanoids-and-rare-varieties.md), a compendium of knowledge about the various humanoid races. She gets an overview of what each volume includes, digging deepest into volume 5. Here she pays particular attention to the story of [Simanelli Tyrol](../characters/simanelli-tyrol.md), a historic water genasi (implied through context clues).

She searches for more details on Captain Tyrol and the era in which he lived. The books she finds confirmed that he was an explorer, a smattering of mentions of him across various sources.

Torbra learns of [The Arrival](../history/events/the-arrival.md), the event in which the races of [Kardan](../places/continents/kardan.md) were brought to [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md). It was around this time that the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) was beginning to form that Captain Tyrol likely existed.

#### [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md): Runes

Torbra then looks for information on runes. With limited time and unsure where to start, she finds nothing.

#### [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md): Winged Humanoids

Searching for mention of winged humanoids, Thanea finds information about Aarakocra in [Humanoids and Rare Varieties](../items/books/humanoids-and-rare-varieties.md).

#### [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md): Prophetic Dreams

Flavian points Thanea to a section of the library concerning magic, in which Flavian finds a scroll detailing foresight, the notion of a gift allowing future events to be seen before they happen. The scroll postulates that the ability appears magic in nature, suggesting that it is likely a type of magical manifestation, i.e. [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) ability. Thanea starts considering that her foresight may be linked to her sorcerer abilities.

The scroll also calls those with foresight by an older pre-common language name: seer.

#### [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md): Sorcerer, [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md)

Thanea searches for anything magical that lines up with her lived experiences as a sorcerer. She finds books that show various failed efforts to understand what makes someone [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), as well as the different manifestations of magic within people. This points to a lack of understanding in the kingdom of the different types of magic. The author of that book notes they spent over 200 years trying to solve this issue and didn't make much progress.

The book mentions that some people are able to study to learn known magic, while others have an innate sense of their ability, something which resonates with Thanea. It also talks about magic as a tool for military use, trying and failing to harness magic to create [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md).

## Staying Overnight

With it getting dark outside, the party must decide where they're staying tonight. The last three weeks they stayed in [The Mission's End](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-missions-end.md), though their bills were paid for them, and now it is their first night with the independence of an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad.

They decide to try [The Mission's End](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-missions-end.md) again tonight for simplicity and familiarity. Thanea asks the [Astorrel Member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) on the door how the system works and she explains all of the specifics. The party pays 4 gp for a party of four, giving them their own room with four beds.

As [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) queues for food at the canteen, a pair of [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) behind her in line can be heard talking about her, recognising the blue firbolg of fame.

## Saoirse Examines the [Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) Again

[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) looks for a quiet spot in which to examine the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) again. She heads out of the back of [The Mission's End](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-missions-end.md) into a back alley. There are a few people back here having private conversations, but otherwise she is able to find a private spot.

She begins to experiment with the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) and the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) she collected from inside of it. While it is clear that the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) is made of the same dust, the dust has a faint arcane aura to it that feels useful to her. Deciding to experiment with some of it, she splits it into thirds:

- Mixed with water.
- Mixed with animal fat.
- Stored for later.

Daring to try the paste formed by mixing the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) with water, Saoirse tries her magical abilities again, looking for any changes. Her Eldritch Blast feels more potent, suggesting that her experiments are not in vain.

Saoirse learns that ingesting some [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) will enhance her magic, though it also appears to have a psychedelic effect that makes it hard for her to concentrate on the world around her.

*[[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) learns how to ingest [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to induce the [meteoric dust effect](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust-effect.md).]*
