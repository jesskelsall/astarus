## Pre-session

### [Inspiration Pool](../mechanics/dm-inspiration.md)

2 dice.

## Camping Before Tresenda

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) camps at the junction of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) road, where the trails to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) and [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) meet - the southern entrance to the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) itself. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) casts Tiny Hut as usual, providing a comfortable environment for the party to sleep in.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

In the morning there is a strong frost present across the landscape, except for the interior of the magical dome.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks where exactly the party is going within the pass. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) shows her on her map ([Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md)), pointing out the area that [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) had drawn a rectangle around during the original offering of this mission (the entire [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) south of its narrowest section). Thanea adds to this, recalling her dream ([Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)) which gave her the impression that they should look in the northeast of the pass, judging by the appearance of snow capped mountains that she ascended ([Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md)).

## Entering the Pass

The party begins their march into the south end of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) with [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) leading and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) keeping an eye on their rear. Torbra is distracted by a pebble in her boot, but [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is perceptive, able to keep the party on the rough suggestion of a trail, connecting the thin worn path sections to dried out muddy puddles and areas where the path disappears briefly before it restarts. There is a real sense that this is not a well travelled route.

[Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) is a grassy valley flanked by hills to the east and west, an appreciable distance separating both edges. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) observes a stream far to the right hand side of the valley snaking between the terrain. As the morning progresses the party are lead across undulating gentle hills, each crest revealing the next few miles of similar terrain.

By mid-morning [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is bored of the hike and begins bothering [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md), trying to get her to play a game with her. Thanea jokes that she used to play "surviving in the woods" as a child, chuckling when Saoirse asks if it's something they can play here. Thanea relates to growing up without her parents in the forest before she asks Saoirse about her childhood games. Saoirse talked about getting bullied by the local kids due to her mother's profession. [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) taught her how to cast Eldritch Blast, after which the pair started playing hide and seek semi-regularly.

Thanea finds it unfair playing such a game with someone who can speak to Saoirse wherever she is. Saoirse reflects, now annoyed at the thought that Effie is likely the sort who would cheat, though she is full of pride that she always "won" when casting Eldritch Blast at objects. Thanea suggests the pair don't play games while in the pass due to the wolves they've been told about and [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) posing danger, if they are here.

While Saoirse and Thanea are talking, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) notices two brown shapes (deer killed by wolves) laying in the grass over by the stream to the east. She points them out to the group and looks closer, recognising them both as deer. Saoirse comments that where there is prey there are likely predators. Nobody notices that they are dead.

The rest of the day passes without incident, the repeating undulating terrain between the valley warping their perception of distance. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) observes the gentle stream progressing closer to the path, up to about 20ft away at its closest before heading back to the east of the valley after half an hour more of travel. The stream changes from a defined cut stream to water washing over the grass, its route not well defined.

As the sun begins to set over the hills to the west, rapidly rising shadows can be seen on the hills to the east, growing higher with each passing minute. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) suggests that Thanea could use her Radiant Soul wings to check their surroundings from a height:

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> You, bird person. Can't you fly up and see if there's anything around here?

Thanea first consults her map, struggling to get a good bearing on a map that isn't topographically accurate, but estimates that the party is anyway from 1/5 to 1/2 of the way up the pass. She is doubtful that she'll see anything from here, but gives it a try anyway, using Radiant Soul to grow her wings and take off to her maximum height.

Above the hilltops of the valley the air is bitingly cold and the wind picks up significantly, which prevents Thanea from wanting to linger at this height. She is able to make out the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) in the distant haze of the horizon and can place the party, realising that they are about 1/4 of the way up the pass. She spots the deer again, noticing flashes of red (blood) on/around them. Looking further north she observes 20-50 "grey dots with legs walking" (wolves) high up in the western hills. She descends with haste and relays what she's seen and where the party is, reckoning the party have some way to go yet.

## Wolves Through the Night

Torbra suggests camping for the night and continuing in the morning. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) casts Tiny Hut, making it dirt brown and unlit on the inside for the night.

| Character(s) | Shift | Observations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | 4h | Cloudy with no light from any source. Unremarkable. |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | 4h | Sound of shuffling close by right from start of shift.<br>Near sunrise, wolves howling echoing across the valley. |

*[Everyone: long rest]*

Thanea and Torbra weren't able to perceive a pack of wolves that picked up the party's scent and moved in close during the night, staying close by. They are confused by the hut but are sure that prey is nearby, so they loiter in anticipation of the morning light.

As the sun begins to rise and illuminate the valley, Torbra notices the pack of 14 wolves, around 20ft away in one group. Some are sat, others are watching the hut intently. Torbra wakes up the rest of the party as quietly as she can. She alerts them to the nearby danger.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) asks [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) how much longer her Tiny Hut will remain up, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) informing her that it likely won't last much longer and she has no control over that. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) casts Mage Armour on herself while Saoirse casts Armour of Agathys. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) tries to cast Dancing Lights to illuminate the area between the hut and the wolves, but her magic is unable to penetrate the magical dome.

The party frantically try to strategise. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Torbra suggest trying to sneak away and avoid combat while Saoirse tries to come up with various ideas, each incompatible with Tiny Hut.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) yells loudly in an attempt to scare off the wolves, treating them like black bears. This has the opposite effect, causing the wolves to ready themselves for combat. The remaining wolves stand up, some begin snarling, and the grouped together pack of wolves moves to encircle the magical dome, now spread out evenly around it. Torbra and Thanea shout at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) in disbelief at what she's done. Saoirse punches [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) in the arm.

Several of the wolves begin howling loudly. Everyone but Thanea hears the sound of distant wolves deeper into the valley responding to the call in kind. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is able to perceive three separate packs of wolves responding - two to the north and one to the south.

Saoirse casts Minor Illusion to make a beast-like sound in an attempt to scare the wolves off, but it isn't particularly loud and sounds wolf-like, only managing to ward off two wolves who both reposition slightly further away. Thanea uses Radiant Soul, sprouting her wings.

## Tiny Hut Fades

In this moment [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s Tiny Hut ends, the dome dissipating in an instant. The wolves can now clearly see the party before them.

*[Initiative order begins]*

The wolves get the jump on the party, most of them descending on the party and lunging in for bites. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) is bitten while three wolves descend on [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md), one landing a critical hit. Two attack [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), one managing to bit her. Frost races down her body from Armour of Agathys, icing over the wolf's head. It pulls back reflexively, its snout and mouth still stuck to Saoirse as its head collapses into icy chunks, its now limp body collapsing to the floor. Saoirse growls at the other wolves surrounding the party.

Thanea takes two more hits as more wolves descend on the party. At this point there are 9 wolves in melee range of the party, with 4 more maintaining a perimeter, watching for their moment to strike.

Thanea casts Fireball on one of the perimeter wolves, a giant fireball racing towards her, [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Torbra, catching the wolves in that direction in the fireball which dissipates just in time to not hit the party. The blast vaporises the targeted wolf and scorches three adjacent to the party, the smell of burning wolf and fur acrid in the air. Thanea takes flight, one wolf landing a bite on her, attempting to pin her as she kicks off. Torbra shouts for her to go, inspiring her to push past the wo and ascend 20ft into the air.

Torbra uses Giant's Might to grow large before swinging down at one of the wolves attacking her. She connects with her halberd once but her grip slips for her second strike, missing. She uses Action Surge to try to finish it off, but misses twice, the wolf reading her panicked attacks and darting out of the way of each.

Saoirse casts Shatter behind the three wolves in front of her, blasting their minds with a loud ringing noise. Two of them can't take the pain and collapse unconscious. Saoirse moves to flank the wolf attacking [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), the surviving wolf near her unable to make an attack of opportunity as it already did so to Thanea. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) casts Blade Ward on herself before inspiring Thanea.

The perimeter wolves charge in, two attacking Saoirse, and one each attacking Torbra and [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md). One of the wolves connects with Saoirse, its pack tactics neutralised by Thanea's Restore Balance. It is destroyed by Armour of Agathys. Two wolves lunge at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), one connecting, though it grinds its teeth against a spinning blade from Blade Ward, taking much of the power out of its attack.

Three wolves attack Torbra, two of which land bites on her. She retaliates, encouraged on by positive words from [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), landing a second hit on the wolf in front of her. Her halberd sinks into its shoulder, causing one of its front legs to go limp. It scrambles back to its feet, clearly on death's door. Torbra uses Second Wind to dig deeper.

Thanea casts Scorching Ray sending out three beams from her fingertips. One hits the wounded wolf in front of Torbra, piercing its back and finishing it off. The remaining two beams are fired at the wolf at Torbra's rear, one beam impacting its back, causing it to flinch and reassess the wisdom of fighting these people.

Saoirse casts Eldritch Blast, pumping two blasts into two wolves, finishing the wolf behind Torbra and impacting one in front of her, pushing it 10ft away. She tries to slap the back of the wolf in front of her but misses.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) tries to stab the wolf in front of her with her rapier before throwing her dagger at the one behind Saoirse but misses with both attacks, frustrated as the sequence of events don't play out as she imagined in her head.

The wolf that Saoirse pushed away charges towards her, dodging an attack of opportunity from Torbra as it goes, landing a critical hit on Saoirse and pushing her to the ground before it is iced over from Armour of Agathys and dies. This consumes the last of Saoirse's icy armour, ending its effect. The wolf behind her bites down at her, sinking its teeth into her. The two wolves facing [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) both attack her, one landing a bite on her.

Torbra swings at and connects with one of the wolves attacking [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), gouging a chunk from its hide. She tries to follow it up with a second hit but misses. Thanea, still airborne, casts Fire Bolt on the wolf behind Saoirse, scorching it with an included burst of radiant damage, finishing it off. Saoirse gets up and thanks Thanea. She casts Poison Spray on the wolf attacking [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) that is closest to Torbra, the poisonous gas filling its lungs as it begins breathing heavy before passing out.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) sinks her rapier into the remaining wolf, sliding it in above its collar bone. The damage is enhanced by Psychic Blades, twisting the wound mentally to the point where the damage is too much. Her blade slides in and out of it very plainly, the wolf collapsing straight after.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## Morning Aftermath

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) goes straight over to [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and asks if she's okay, noting that she seems off her game today. She blames her night watch.

By this point the sun has crested the hills to the east, flooding the valley with a morning glow.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) heads over to a charred wolf corpse, cutting it open to see if it looks edible. The flesh has barely been cooked by the heat, and only closest to the surface. Saoirse comes over to berate her for being so morbid.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) comes over, livid, to get an explanation for why she shouted at the wolves. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) explains sincerely that she was trying to scare them away but Thanea refuses to believe it, expecting a different motive. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) explains that she was using a technique that scares bears away. Thanea asks if she's ever done that before, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) stating she has. Saoirse relates a story of being told to urinate on wolf corpses as they are territorial, but dismisses the advice as it sounded sketchy and was imparted by a drunkard, suggesting that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) lacks critical thinking skills, and that she shouldn't be applying bear techniques to wolves. She chastises [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), telling her not to do it again.

The party begins to pack up their gear. Thanea goes to sit by herself to eat a ration, Saoirse joining her. The party opts to rest for an hour to catch their breath before setting off. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) spends her time gathering wood for a fire on which to cook some wolf meat. She is able to cook up two portions - one of which she eats, the other she saves for later.

*[Everyone: short rest]*

## Continuing Deeper

Once everyone is ready to go, the party hits the trail again, continuing north. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) takes the lead as she feels she has a good idea of where they need to go. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) hangs back at the rear, keeping about 20ft between her and the rest of the party.

Thanea leads the party along the trail, keeping an eye out for familiar hills and mountain views to the northeast. They valley floor continues to undulate. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) watches as the pack of dead wolves disappears from view as they pass over a small hilltop, no sign of activity being left behind. The morning mist on the east side of the valley burns off as the morning progresses, the path continuing to hug the west side of the valley. The sun emerges from behind the clouds, sunny spells visibly crossing the valley as the clouds float in a westerly direction.

Thanea spots the snow capped [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) coming into view on the horizon. She recognises the arrangement of the mountains and her position in the valley, though it is more of a feeling than an exact recollection. She tells the party that it reminds her of what she saw in her dream. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) encourages her to take flight again to get a better look, but she is too tired to do so again today.

Saoirse asks for specifics from the dream so everyone can help her locate where they're going. Thanea suggests that the sunny day matches her dream, and this feels like the area where she began chasing [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) up the hill and mountain tops. She suggests the party keeps their eyes open from this point on as it seems to be close to the dream's starting point.

Thanea considers leading the party up into the hills to the northeast, but the hills are covered in areas of scree with few workable paths that could be ascended. She suggests continuing along the trail but isn't sure. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks what she hopes they'll find if they follow the path, beyond arriving at the next settlement. Collectively they decide to proceed on, doing so until early afternoon. The trail begins to move to the eastern side of the valley, but then begins heading back to the western slope, prompting the party to once again question where they should go.

Thanea feels that the mountain views from here are much more reminiscent of her dream, suggesting that this is the place where they should begin heading off the trail to the north east. As night begins to set in, they consider camping for the night before another full day of hiking tomorrow.
