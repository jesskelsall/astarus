## Fighting the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md)

[Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) becomes a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) and stands up, preparing to attack [Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) with its blade arms.

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) witnesses the transformation and reacts immediately, grabbing Kieran, dragging him out of the bedroom, and throwing him to one side. She then rushes back into the room and uses Giant's Might to grow taller. Attempting to grapple the creature she fails, getting sliced by its blades in the process.

Kieran begs Torbra not to hurt the creature that was formerly Slaine, moving back into view of the door so he can see what is happening.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) rushes forward to help. She passes a length of rope to Torbra. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) gets her hands around the creature while Torbra gets the rope around it, restraining it.

The [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) opens up a mouth on its featureless face, wailing toward those in front of it, blasting [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), Torbra, Thanea and Kieran with force damage. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) slams into the wall behind her, knocking her prone. Kieran flies through the door on the other side of the hallway, breaking the door and throwing him against the bed inside the room. Kieran reacts by casting Cure Wounds on himself and hiding out of sight in a corner of the room.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) opts to bonk the creature over the head with her staff infused with Shillelagh, doing virtually no damage to it. Thanea drops prone and casts Witch Bolt between Torbra's legs, blasting the creature. Her beam of magic begins to ablate some of the creature's [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) from its surface, the dust scattering onto the floor.

[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) witnessed the creature transforming and rising for battle. The sight of this terrified her, a pointed realisation that Slaine was suffering with similar compulsions as her own [Meteoridis](../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md). She opts to hide behind the table on the landing. [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) hears the commotion upstairs and runs to the rescue, shouting Slaine's name as she goes. Saoirse then bolts down the stairs, wishing to run away from the creature.

Torbra continues to wrestle with the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), slamming it into the ground. Still restrained, it opens its mouth again, wailing at Torbra, Thanea, and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) once again takes the full brunt of the attack which slams her into the wall for a second time, knocking her unconscious.

## A Dangerous Situation

As Thanea continues to channel Witch Bolt at the creature, it dawns on Thanea and Torbra that the creature is still looking healthy. A grave mood comes over the pair, the realisation that the group is in serious trouble.

Thanea consequently backs away from the room, shouting that the creature is dangerous. Torbra echoes the sentiment by shouting that it won't die. Janneke darts across the corridor to the far corner, shouting for Kieran to help the party.

Torbra digs deep and takes a breath before attempting to force the creature out of the window next to the bed. She is able to force it onto the bed, but it is able to make its limbs wide enough to prevent her from forcing it through the window. With [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) unconscious in the room, Torbra instead chooses to drag the creature into the corridor. She ends up in the room opposite where Kieran is cowering.

The creature creates a mouth again and wails, hitting Torbra and Thanea. Both get caught in the blast but shrug off the main force of the attack. Kieran, awkwardly perched on some furniture in the corner of the room that Torbra is now in, casts [Sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) on himself, worrying about his own safety first and foremost.

With the creature out of the original room, Thanea dashes across the hallway to try and tend to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). As she heads past the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) is lashes out at her, slashing her back and knocking her unconscious just inside the room.

Saoirse hears the continued combat upstairs and decides to pluck up the courage to intervene. She rushes back upstairs, letting loose an Eldritch Blast at the creature but missing. She moves back behind the table. Janneke shouts in confusion while slashing at the creature with her short sword.

*[Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md):*

> What the hell is this thing!?

The creature is starting to shed a notable amount of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) at this point, though not enough to disrupt its form or function. Torbra continues to lay into the creature, noticing it is starting to show some damage. It wails once again, hitting Kieran as well this time, who falls unconscious.

## Back From the Brink

Saoirse runs into the original room to try and help Thanea. She runs around the creature before tending to Thanea's wounds, successfully stabilising her before moving out of the doorway. Janneke then runs into the room, taking a slash from the creature. She bypasses Thanea to tend to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and is successful in stabilising her.

Torbra slashes at the creature again with her halberd, landing a critical hit, inflicting a large wound in it. All of the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) surrounding Slaine's body immediately drops to the floor as his body falls backwards, revealing a human shaped mound of flesh - his skin and features destroyed by the dust's hostile takeover of his person.

Torbra moves back onto the bed, taking a hard earned breather while allowing space for someone to enter and help Kieran. Saoirse is able to rush in and stabilise Kieran before going to the corner of the room to throw up, visibly disturbed by the events that just transpired.

Saoirse shouts to the party that she is leaving to get [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md). She runs out of [the Dog's Groke](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md) and into the [Sunrise District](../places/districts/sunrise-district.md).

## Dust on the Move

[Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) rushes over to Kieran, managing to bring him back to consciousness. Torbra runs into the other room, attempting unsuccessfully to rouse Thanea and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). Kieran turfs her out of the room so he can cast Cure Wounds at 2nd level on both, bringing them back to consciousness. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) returns the favour before the pair briefly discuss what just happened.

Janneke, seeing the fleshy corpse, drops to her knees next to it and cries uncontrollably.

Torbra notices that the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) is on the move and is starting to assemble near Slaine's corpse, creating a 1ft cube of dust. She scoops up as much of it as she can, placing it into her iron pot. Thanea considers burning the dust but doesn't wish to set the building on fire. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Produce Flame to burn it, but it doesn't appear to do much.

The dust is beginning to pick itself up and float through the air, swirling around the pot in a single arced stream that winds its way into the pot. This process is becoming steadily more apparent and moving faster.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) throws the pot across the room, causing half of the dust inside to scatter across the landing. The rest sits inside the pot which landed on its side. She witnesses that pile of dust slowly drift back into the pot, tipping it upright in the process. The rest of the dust begins sliding across the floor in the pot's direction.

[Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) rushes over to the pot and casts Dispel Magic into it. As soon as he does so all of the dust in the room stops moving on its own, instead settling under regular gravity. He remarks to the party that he cast the same spell that he was trying on the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) earlier when [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) turned into the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md). He kicks some of the dust on the floor onto the rug along the landing's length, observing it for a second, satisfied that it now seems inert.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tries manipulating the dust with Mould Earth but it does nothing to it.

The party spends some time sweeping up the dust with a broom found downstairs, collecting as much of it as possible in the pot - about 90% of it, half filling the pot.
