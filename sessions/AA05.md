## Negotiations in Draconic

As [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) are led into the [Blue Kobold Cave](../places/caves/blue-kobold-cave.md), the rest of the party begin their wait for their safe return.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) sets out a picnic for the consumption of rations. She offers some up for the two kobold dragonshields that are remaining with the party as collateral. Sensing a free meal they quickly move in and scarf the food down before retreating nervously.

## Deep Inside the Cave

Ahsha and [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) are lead by the four kobold dragonshields deep into the cave. With grain sacks over their heads it is hard for them to tell where they're going. Eventually they hear a wooden door open and are negotiated through a narrow and winding cave tunnel before coming to a stop in a larger room.

As the bags are taken off from their heads they realise that they're in a room with four hexagonal pillars and a raised section at its rear, which they are looking towards. At its top is [Ikra](../characters/ikra.md), the kobold scale sorcerer who leads the blue kobolds. To their sides and backs are the four kobold dragonshields, weapons raised, ready to strike if the pair try anything foolish.

Ahsha says "peace" in draconic before beginning to have something translated into draconic by [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md). [Ikra](../characters/ikra.md) reveals that they can speak common before introducing themself. Ahsha states that their intention here is to ensure the forest is being taken care of, and that her group wants to negotiate a peace treaty between the kobolds and [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md).

[Ikra](../characters/ikra.md) is very to-the-point, telling Ahsha that all they want is to be left alone. They are worried that the villagers are getting too close to their cave and they should keep their distance, hence the traps. Ahsha tries to impress upon them that traps are not a good idea.

Ahsha tries to work out a trade deal, but has an uphill battle when it becomes clear that the kobolds have no sense of currency or bartering, instead taking what they need and keeping it for themselves. Ahsha painfully goes over the basics of trade and commerce, eventually getting some of the concepts through to [Ikra](../characters/ikra.md).

When Ahsha explains that gold as currency can be used to trade goods, [Ikra](../characters/ikra.md) tries to equate their large polished turquoise gemstone to currency, taking it from the pedestal in the raised area and showing it to her. Ahsha agrees that this could be used as currency. [Ikra](../characters/ikra.md) ups the ante and instead offers their [Blue Dragon Scale Necklace](../items/blue-dragon-scale-necklace.md), their most prized possession, if it would mean being left alone for good.

Ahsha isn't keen to take their prized possessions as payment, instead asking if there is anything else they need. [Ikra](../characters/ikra.md) explains that they are hungry, relying mostly on skunks as a food source. They steal food from [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) to stay alive and have even resorted to eating leather. When Ahsha explains that [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) could give them food in exchange for staying away from their cave, [Ikra](../characters/ikra.md) is willing to come to an agreement.

With that, negotiations end. [Ikra](../characters/ikra.md) explains that the villagers must keep a certain distance from the cave and provides two kobold dragonshields to show them where the boundary is so that the party can mark it for the villagers. Ahsha and [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) are once again blindfolded and lead out of the cave.

## Outside the Cave

While negotiations are ongoing, the rest of the party are keeping an eye on the cave entrance, the kobolds with them, and the forest behind them.

[Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) hears a noise coming from the forest, moving away from the cave mouth to investigate. She hears the sound of boars before a pack of boars emerges from the edge of the forest, lead by a large boar. Seeing Redwyn, they charge towards her.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Redwyn runs back to the group who are now alerted to the boars charging towards them. They quickly catch up to her, and she finds herself being attacked repeatedly as she tries to run away each turn without using the disengage action.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) springs into action, going into her Starry Form (archer), picking the closest boars off from a distance. [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) dives in, attacking the large boar in the midst of the commotion.

The kobold dragonshields run for their weapons, gearing themselves up and helping the party out. They're able to hold their own against the boars, keeping them at bay and landing some impressive blows for creatures of their size.

Ultimately the boars don't get good hits in and aren't able to charge due to the positions of the party. They are picked off one by one, the fight petering out and becoming a formality.

*[Initiative order ends]*

In the aftermath the two kobold dragonshields begin preparing the boars, dragging them towards the mouth of the cave so they can be brought inside for food. Ephaine helps out.

## The Party Reunites

Ahsha and [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) emerge from the cave not long after the fight against the boars ends. Their bags are moved, revealing the aftermath of the fight. Ahsha explains to the party what was agreed, the party happy with the outcome. The other dragonshields begin working together to drag the large boar into the cave, while one dragonshield and two kobold inventors join the party as they head south towards the [Arnaside Logging Camp](../places/structures/arnaside-logging-camp.md).

At the logging line the kobolds make clear where the villagers must go no further. This is marked on several trees in this area with a cross at Ahsha's suggestion, and the kobold inventors set up a cage which they tie to a tree and stake into the ground, designed as a food and leather drop so that the villagers can honour their agreement. [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) expresses scepticism that this plan will work, but agrees to go with the party to help convince the village.

With this, the party and the kobolds part ways. The party heads into [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) to tell the village what the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have negotiated for them.

## Informing [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md)

Back at [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md), the party head to [Nenra Zossa](../characters/nenra-zossa.md) in [the Malneshitas](../places/buildings/temples/the-malneshitas.md) and inform her of the negotiations and their outcome. Nenra is wary of leaving the kobolds alive, but trusts that the party have done their job correctly. She is hopeful that this will create a peace, and so she will see to it that the rest of the village honour the agreement.

She instructs [Kulegar Bronhor](../characters/kulegar-bronhor.md) to round up the village so they can prepare a feast in the [Head & Haft](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/head-and-haft.md) that evening to celebrate the party's successes.

With some time to kill before the party, each person has some time to themselves:

| Character | Action |
| --- | --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | Goes with [Kulegar Bronhor](../characters/kulegar-bronhor.md) to teach the village about sustainable logging practices and the extent of the kobolds' territory. |
| [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | Travels west to spend time on the closest beach. Sees [Karmox](../places/mountains/karmox.md) off in the distance. |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | Nothing noteworthy. |
| [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | Spends time alone on the cliffs overlooking the sea. |

## An [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) Feast

By nightfall the feast is ready. Most of the village packs into the [Head & Haft](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/head-and-haft.md), with [Nenra Zossa](../characters/nenra-zossa.md) leading the celebrations with [Kulegar Bronhor](../characters/kulegar-bronhor.md). The village have scrounged up their supplies to put together a modest feast, with individuals' private alcohol stashes coming out to shore up the tavern's stocks.

The party mingle with the village, getting to know [Zanni Flipwit](../characters/zanni-flipwit.md) who pays a brief visit. [Clay Mullen](../characters/clay-mullen.md) is invited by the party and is happy to attend. Ahsha and Kulegar bond over their orcish lineage when Ahsha challenges him to an arm wrestle. She beats him twice on a best of three, before the pair begin singing orcish sea shanties late into the night, making quite the commotion.

[Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) works up the courage to talk to Whisper about the day's events. He is thankful to him for what the group have done for the party, noting their combat prowess in the boar battle. When [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) expresses feelings for Whisper, Whisper goes straight in for a kiss, which [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) shares willingly. [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) suggests that they go back to his house for the night. Whisper is quick to agree, so the two disappear from the tavern into the night before spending the night together.

As the feast winds down, the villagers head home for the night. The party helps to tidy up the [Head & Haft](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/head-and-haft.md) before sleeping there again overnight.

*[Long rest]*

## Heading Back to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md)

In the morning the party begin their journey back to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), riding on [Clay Mullen](../characters/clay-mullen.md)'s coach as they did on the way here. It takes them 3 days to return to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), with them arriving after dark.

They part ways with Clay. While he is happy for their patronage and offers his services in the future, he points out that he'd like to stick to the main roads from now on.

The party makes their way into the city's [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md), resolving to stay at [The Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) overnight before reporting back to [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) in the morning. Here they order drinks (Fox Tail Brewery "Sea Foam Spray") and Ahsha is once again generous with her gold.

Ahsha inquires to [Tydrus Tinshield](../characters/tydrus-tinshield.md) about pit fighting in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). He quietly informs her of The Rat's Nest, an inn in the [Sunrise District](../places/districts/sunrise-district.md) that has a pit fighting scene, but to keep it to herself. She thanks him for the information.

The party turns in for the night, eager to get to [Bryce Morton's Office](../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md) in the morning.

*[Long rest]*

## Tension at the Stronghold

The party wakes up early and gets breakfast in the inn before heading to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

On arrival at the gatehouse they notice an increased presence of [Astorrel guards](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) in the gatehouse, as well as a contingent of [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) waiting outside, staring down at the [Astorrel guards](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md). This includes an [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md).

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) also notices a blue tiefling ([Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md)) lying down on the roof of the 3 storey building to the right hand side of the street. She tells the rest of the party of what she sees, finding his presence up there concerning.

The party decides to head into the stronghold as normal, asking the [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) what's going on. He explains that there is a group of four in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), much to the annoyance of the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) who were after them.

## Completing the Mission

The party returns to [Bryce Morton's Office](../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md) in [Auric Rise](../places/buildings/auric-rise.md) to hand in the mission. Bryce welcomes them back, happy they have completed their mission with four days to spare.

Bryce asks [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) to remain in the room with him so that he can show her how to write a mission report, a mandatory component of any mission. He offers to show her now, but explains that she can write the report elsewhere, or write it up right now while she's here. She chooses to do the latter.

Ahsha agrees this with the rest of the group, telling them to meet her at [The Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) in a few hours once she's done.

### Mission Report

*See: [Astorrel Mission Report](../mechanics/roleplay/astorrel-mission-report.md)*  
*See: [Check Logging in Arnaside](../storylines/check-logging-in-arnaside.md)*

Ahsha completes her report, doing a fair job of conveying the facts of the mission without embellishing or outright lying. Her part about the bandits on the road isn't read by Bryce as credible however.

When rating the performance of each [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) member and ranking them, Ahsha places high importance on herself which comes across justifiably in the report. She looks down on Redwyn for how she handled the first cave encounter, but Bryce looked upon her write-up of Whisper least favourably.

Upon turning in her report, [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) gives [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) 80 gp - the earnings of all four [Astorrel Squad Hands](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) for the mission, trusting her to dish it out evenly amongst them.
