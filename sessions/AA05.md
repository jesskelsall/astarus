## Transport

The party can source over-land transport to [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) from the stables just inside the [Sunrise District](../../../astarus/places/districts/sunrise-district.md).

- Coach: 3 cp / mile
  - 4 cp / mile (~1.5x) from [Allonby](../../../astarus/places/villages/allonby.md) to [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md)
- Cart: 2 cp / mile
  - 3 cp / mile (1.5x) from [Allonby](../../../astarus/places/villages/allonby.md) to [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md)
- Scheduled supply cart: free
  - Only as far as [Allonby](../../../astarus/places/villages/allonby.md)
  - Limited space
  - Must help with loading/unloading (time consuming)
  - Works to the trader's schedule

## Travel

The [Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../../../astarus/other/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md) is a kingdom scale map. Each hex is 6 mi.

| Pace | mi/Hour | mi/Day | Hex/Hour | Hex/Day | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fast | 4 mi | 30 mi | 1 hex / 1.5 hr | 5 hexes / day | -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores |
| Normal | 3 mi | 24 mi | 1 hex / 2 hr | 4 hexes / day | |
| Slow | 2 mi | 18 mi | 1 hex / 3 hr | 3 hexes / day | Able to use Stealth. |

## Forest Traps

The kobolds have set traps to ward off anyone at [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) that dares venture closer to their cave.

Falling: 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 10ft fell (max 20d6).

- Sample Traps (DMG p122)
  - Simple Pit
  - Hidden Pit
  - Falling Net

## Tension Spikes

A tripwire between two trees is connected to branches bent around one of those trees. They are covered in sharpened twigs, creating a makeshift spike wall, pulled taut by the rope.

If the tripwire is tripped, the rope holding the branches in place comes loose, and the wall of spikes flies out from the bush obscuring it, hitting the unsuspecting victim.

- Spotting the tripwire: DC 10 perception check.
- Spotting the spikes: DC 13 perception check.
- Disarming the tripwire: same as Falling Net.
- Hit by trap:
  - Dexterity saving throw, DC 15.
    - Half damage on success.
  - 2d10 piercing damage.
