I decided to provide a role play opportunity for [Hannah](../players/hannah.md) and [Robin](../players/robin.md) following the dream sequence at the end of the last session.

## Pre-session

### [Inspiration Pool](../mechanics/dm-inspiration.md)

1 dice.

## Dream Aftermath

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) are sharing a room in [the Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md). As the dream ([Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)) ends, Saoirse wakes up screaming, covered in cold sweat. This wakes Thanea up. Saoirse starts crying.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> I'm so sorry! I just fucked it all up. I... I always ruin everything. I'm so sorry.

Thanea is confused and asks if it was Saoirse in the dream, just trying to be sure. The pair confirm that they saw each other.

Saoirse tells Thanea that she doesn't think she'll ever be like her. Thanea tries to reassure her by telling her that she just has to be the best person she can be. Saoirse tells her that she's been trying so hard, and confides in her that she doesn't feel good enough.

When Saoirse says she feels like a freak, Thanea tries to relate, but Saoirse won't have it, calling Thanea a "fucking angel". Thanea makes it clear that being an angel isn't all that good, as people treat you differently and it is very uncomfortable.

## Saoirse's Patron

Thanea asks about Saoirse's friend ([Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md)) that has been in some of her dreams, pointing out that maybe she wants Saoirse to do something different. Saoirse thinks, pointing out that Effie often has mischief in mind for her, but doesn't consider her evil. Thanea suggests that she may be possessive, but Saoirse retorts that she doesn't hear much from Effie since meeting Thanea and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) in [Goldreach](../places/settlements/towns/goldreach.md).

Thanea continues trying to figure out Effie's deal. Maybe she is manipulating Saoirse in a way that's interfering with her powers? Thanea asks if she knows more about Effie from other people or if there may be some information on her in a book somewhere. Saoirse thinks that is unlikely as "Effie is just a child like me".

Thanea thinks that everything Saoirse has told her about effie feels magical, which Saoirse agrees with, saying that she has taught her everything she knows.

## Saoirse's Deva

Thanea explains that with her deva dreams, resisting the point of the dream and acting counter to it has always resulted in bad things happening, so she advises Saoirse to do the same. Saoirse explains that in her dreams with the radiant figure ([Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md)) she hasn't resisted.

Saoirse explains that [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) has always been helpful in her dreams, coming to her aid often. Thanea suggests that [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) might currently be trying to help her with the darkness they saw in their most recent dream.

Thanea makes it clear that her deva dreams are rarely literal future events, for example her dream about the location of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) ([Thanea Deva Dream 2](../dreams/deva-thanea-2.md)) suggested that returning to [Goldreach](../places/settlements/towns/goldreach.md) would result in the town being burned down, but that didn't happen. Perhaps their most recent dream shouldn't be taken literally either, and that it won't be as dangerous as it looks. Saoirse doesn't feel like the dream showed a dangerous situation.

## Differing Beginnings

Thanea asks Saoirse if her dream started with the mountain pass ([Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md)). Saoirse doesn't recall that, so Thanea gives a description, suggesting it was of the mountain pass that their next [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission will take them to ([Search for a Meteorite in Tresenda Pass](../storylines/search-for-a-meteorite-in-tresenda-pass.md)).

Saoirse recalls the start of her own dream, explaining that she was outside of [Ethel's Wares](../places/buildings/shops/ethels-wares.md), the shop containing [Etheldreda Dowsing](../characters/etheldreda-dowsing.md), who she tells Thanea is somehow connected to [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md). She followed [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) and similarly ended up in the [Kas'ran Desert](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/kasran-desert.md).

She goes on to recant her body turning black after briefly turning radiant white, the darkness overtaking her before being lead into the eye of the storm.

Thanea reiterates that the dream shouldn't be taken literally, trying to reassure Saoirse that this is not her future.

Thanea tells Saoirse that [Ethel](../characters/etheldreda-dowsing.md) being connected to Effie means that there is someone she could ask about her. Saoirse doesn't feel that she should ask, suggesting that associating with Effie is what has lead to her current woes.

Saoirse reads into the first half of her dream, noting that [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) lead her away from the shop, which might be a suggestion on her trajectory - that she should disassociate from Effie and listen to [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) more. Thanea agrees, suggesting that she might have to make a choice in the future to this end. Saoirse tells her that she often has to make choices in her dreams, so that might be practice for future events. She thinks she has always chosen [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md)'s side.

Thanea explains that when she does as [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) wants in her dreams, she feels a warmth inside of her that she also feels when using Radiant Soul to make her wings appear. Saoirse can't relate to the feeling. Thanea suggests that she has two powerful entities vying for her attention, so she should go with whatever feels most right to her.

Thanea asks Saoirse if she prefers her current life or her life before leaving home. Saoirse chuckles and answers quickly - she prefers her life now, despite having to buy her own booze, because she likes hanging out with the party and going on adventures, even fighting creatures. Her life is so much more interesting than it was before.

## Intertwined Destinies?

Thanea says Saoirse is happier because she now has a purpose. She suggests their dreams are important and likely preparing them for something else. Saoirse notes that she only started having dreams after she met Thanea, and the pair have now shared a dream together, so that can't be normal. Thanea agrees, feeling there must be some sort of connection between them.

Thanea talks about being in [Supreme Hall](../places/buildings/government/supreme-hall.md) in front of [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md), recanting what he said about her abilities being unique and unheard of before in the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). That makes their connection even more special.

Saoirse asks Thanea if she thinks their abilities are a blessing or a curse. Thanea isn't sure, but they'll surely find out in time.

## Torbra and Genasi

Thanea makes comparison to [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and her genasi lineage which they've recently learned more about through [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and his daughter [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md), also an earth genasi. Saoirse regrets not being more involved in Torbra's revelations, being too focused on trying to figure out her own issues and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s death.

Thanea hesitantly calls Torbra not human, possessing non-magical powers that is called "genasi". She wonders if she's learned more from her research than the pair have been told. She recalls that Torbra was found in the forest as a baby.

## [Aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) Parents

Comparing herself to Torbra, Thanea tells Saoirse that she herself was found in the forest as a child and adopted. Saoirse relates, saying she doesn't know her father ([Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md)). Thanea checks that she knows her mother, which Saoirse confirms, stating that she likes her mother.

Thanea suggests that Saoirse should write to her mother and ask about her father. Saoirse realises that it's been a long time since she contacted her and considers it a good suggestion. She used to send her money after pickpocketing from others. Thanea wonders if they could figure more out about their situation through information about Saoirse's father.

Saoirse connects dots between her absent father and her male deva:

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Now I really hope that dude isn't my dad, because how the fuck can I hate an angel?

Thanea reminds Saoirse again that she's taking her dreams too literally, which calms Saoirse down somewhat. She suggests that through Saoirse's father they might find a lead on Thanea's biological parents, or at least any information about them. Thanea feels that they are likely dead, because why else would they leave their baby in the forest, unless they were running from something?

Saoirse hopes that Thanea is wrong and she can meet them someday, but Thanea feels that they'd have tried to make contact with her already if they're still alive. It doesn't even cross her mind that they would choose to abandon her. Saoirse gives Thanea a big hug.

Saoirse wonders if Torbra knows her parents, noting she is too self-obsessed to remember. Thanea incorrectly recalls that Torbra knows hers, not recalling that Torbra too was abandoned as a child on the edge of the woods and adopted by a couple.

## The Third Person

Thanea asks Saoirse if she saw a third figure ([Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)) in the dream, there with them on [Augury Rock](../places/topography/landmarks/augury-rock.md). Saoirse does, making mention of her "cool armour" and full-face helmet. Thanea adds that she had no wings, and she was escorted into the eye of the storm just like they were, by a glowing figure with wings ([Minsas](../characters/minsas.md)).

Thanea speculates that if there was a third person in the dream that they saw, surely they saw Saoirse and Thanea too. Could they be someone else out in the world having the same dream with them? Does that mean there is another [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) in the world?

Saoirse says maybe, but cautions Thanea to take her own advice and not read too literally into her dreams. Thanea pushes back, saying that her reasoning is logical as her and Saoirse experienced the same thing as they saw from this third figure.

Saoirse isn't sure, noting that she was concentrating on herself and Thanea too much to really consider it during the dream, conscious of the dream and feeling that they were an insignificant part of it. Thanea doesn't dismiss the theory but suggests that perhaps they were led to us.

Saoirse idly suggests that it could be the third figure's fault that she "fucked it up". Thanea suggests that they're overthinking it, taking it too literally after all, and that in time the truth of the dream will become apparent.

Saoirse once again worries that her darkened form and the bad turn of events at the end of the dream is a bad omen. Thanea reassures her that despite everything, [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) still showed her the way and led her to [Augury Rock](../places/topography/landmarks/augury-rock.md), so he is still looking out for her regardless, and so not everything is lost.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> As I said, if you ask me what I think of it, maybe you'll be faced with a decision in the future.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> I mean, aren't we all at some point?  

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Yeah.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) had to make the decision whether to jump into a flaming boat or not to jump into a flaming boat.

Thanea smiles fondly at the memory of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and her antics. Saoirse sadly states that she misses "that stupid horse" before the pair rattle off the various Wild Shape forms that she used in their presence during their travels. Thanea asserts that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) didn't deserve her fate, Saoirse adding that the giant crocodile didn't deserve her as a snack. The pair laugh at [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s expense briefly before Saoirse puts an end to it, wishing for them not to disrespect the dead too much.

## A Word on [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)

While they are alone together, Saoirse asks Thanea what she thinks about [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md). Saoirse states that it's clear that she really doesn't like her as she is "so full of herself", more so than many self-obsessed people.

Thanea asks what her deal is. Saoirse suggests she might be insecure while Thanea thinks she may simply not like getting close to others, hence the cold shoulder.

Saoirse worries that they don't know much about her previous [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad or the circumstances surrounding her moving on from it. Thanea reckons that the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) would have told [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) if it was serious or a danger to them, so they shouldn't worry.

Saoirse gets a quick jab in at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s name, calling it unoriginal and named after something that's in the night sky frequently.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Would you name your child sun?

Thanea expresses her poor grasp on names, having came from a small village, therefore refusing to pass judgement. She hopes that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is at least dependable, especially as they're now stuck with her, so they'll just have to make the most of the situation.

Saoirse wonders if they have any idea what sort of capabilities she has. She notes that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) carries a lute which isn't useful in combat, though Thanea reminds her that she has a rapier, so that's something. Thanea is optimistic, expecting she'll have some combat experience or usefulness of some sort, especially as the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s recruitment standards are so high.

Saoirse suggests that she might sing people to death, evoking a laugh from Thanea. Thanea points out that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) helped negotiates the price down of the rations she bought during the day, so even if she doesn't seem to care, she is at least helpful.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> I've made up my mind though, she's not as cool as us.

## Back to Bed

Thanea chuckles again before the pair yawn, it dawning on them that they should probably go to sleep. Thanea notes that she needs to be up early to get her new map ([Astorrel Map of Southeastern Kardan](../maps/astorrel-map-of-southeastern-kardan.md)) from [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) before [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) hit the road.

Saoirse asks Thanea if it's okay for her to snuggle up with her in bed as she doesn't want to have any weird dreams for the rest of the night. She promises to be good. Thanea is okay with it providing she uses her own blanket.

The pair head back to bed, squeezed into a single bed together, wrapped in their blankets.
