## Campaign Idea

- Magical device that contains a memory of Syntenne, an elven city from the previous realm.
  - Getting attacked by a human kingdom.
  - Elven archmage wishes for them to escape their foe.
  - [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md) teleports the entire city to [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md).
  - City is the later site of [The Arrival](../../history/events/the-arrival.md), built upon/over.
  - Still a city but by another name.
  - City is becoming a gathering point for an organisation of people looking to return to their home plane.
  - Magical device may hold clues for how to get back.
- Stolen by one group who are looking to sell it.
- Second group is buying it for a collector.
- Collector is an elf with a similar device showing a memory from his childhood.
- During the exchange, something goes wrong with the device.
  - Materialises apparitions of warriors who fight the PCs.
  - They get stuck inside the device and witness the city under siege.
  - Device malfunctions, spitting them out near a small village in the desert (?).
  - Device is broken.
