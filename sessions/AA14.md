2 dice.

## Discussing the Shadow

Following their midnight battle against a pack of gnolls spotted by [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) on her watch, the party have a moment to digest what just happened, particularly the first appearance of [Nills](../characters/nills.md) to the rest of the party.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) emerges from the blackness of the forest into the glow of [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)'s starry form, bright white eyes piercing the darkness towards Noon. She takes a bow before dissipating into smoke on the breeze.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) bluntly asks [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) what the "shadow monster" was, pointing out that the squad need to know what each other can do in combat.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> How do I put this... my associate has been my constant companion for as long as I can remember.  
> To explain how I got such an ability would be comparable to asking where you got your limbs.

Ahsha is taken aback by the answer, but doubles down on pointing out how important it is that they have no secret abilities so they can work well as a team. She also acknowledges the fear she just felt when it first appeared.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears again but only to Noon this time, leaning on Ahsha's shoulder to give him a plain warning:

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Be careful here, [brother light](../characters/noon-schiller.md).

Noon assures Ahsha that if any of his abilities become relevant to what the party is doing, he'll let them know. He begins heading back to his tent, but Ephaine and Ahsha aren't happy at the implication that the conversation is over. Ahsha breaks it down for her - she is the [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) and needs her squad mates to be very clear with her about the abilities she can rely on. Ephaine is concerned that Noon doesn't have control of [Nills](../characters/nills.md), particularly after her own challenges controlling her own magic.

Ahsha asks if the shadow is here right now, looking around. As she meets eyes with [Nills](../characters/nills.md), Noon sees her grin playfully back at her. Noon tries to reassure the group that as long as he is on the party's side, so too will the shadow. Ahsha decides that this is a good place to end the conversation while Ephaine sees that as a perilous qualifier.

The party goes back to worrying about going back to sleep and watching over the rest of the night. It is still dark, but Ephaine is able to tell that there are only a few more hours of night left. Ahsha suggests moving on immediately, but Ephaine convinces her and the rest of the party to rest until sunrise.

*[Everyone: short rest]*

## Onward to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md)

By morning the party packs up their camp. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) tries her hand at guiding the wagon's horses, guided by [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) who casts Guidance on her. Ahsha struggles to get the horses to obey, their belligerence felt by the pair. After an hour both horses veer off the road, causing the wagon to tip half-way over before it comes to a stop. Ephaine gently suggests taking back over, Ahsha's pride hurt, otherwise understanding.

As Ephaine is trying to get the wagon out of the ditch, two [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) travelling the other way on horseback flag down Ephaine, saying hello warmly. When they ask what the party is up to, Ephaine dismisses them quickly by explaining they're on official [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) business, flashing her military badge. The guards take this well, leaving the party to their business and moving on, glancing into the back of the wagon as they go, but finding nothing of interest to them.

Three hours later [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) emerge from the trees near to the path, glimpsing the lakes surrounding [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) on both sides of the path. They get their first view of the town itself, noticing the surrounding farmland and a large stone building at its centre.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) searches for a place to stable their horses and wagon, guiding Ephaine up the main road, reaching the T-shaped junction in the town centre. The pair notice an inn named [the Courteous Cow](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-courteous-cow.md) to the right not far from the junction, an entrance nearby to the adjoined stable.

## [The Courteous Cow](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-courteous-cow.md)

Ahsha and Ephaine decide that the party should head inside to see what's going on in [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md). The inn is mostly empty, a few local patrons finishing up an early morning ale and their breakfast.

At the bar they are greeted by [Beludar Plowbreaker](../characters/beludar-plowbreaker.md). Ahsha relaxes when she sees a fellow half-orc, greeting them warmly and introducing herself as [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), wasting no time and stating their business as looking for a missing [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad.

Beludar greets them equally warmly, happy to see new faces. They offer drinks before talking business, which Ahsha agrees to while impressing their time pressure on them. Ahsha pays 1 gp for stabling and 12 cp for four ales.

Ahsha tells Beludar about [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md), pointing out that [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) was their last known whereabouts. Noticing the party's [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md), Beludar tells them about the [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md), pointing out that they may have more luck with military business at a place that caters exclusively to military types. Beludar is disparaging about the closed club, but harbours no ill will to anyone.

Ephaine nonetheless provides descriptions of the party, hoping that one of the descriptions will jog Beludar's memory. Nothing comes to mind. They note that they would know people so varied, particularly against his usual quiet and sparse clientele. Beludar wishes them good luck with their mission, offering them lodging if they wish to come back.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) thanks them for the information before placing 1 sp on the bar, declaring it a tip. This flusters Beludar who insists it's not necessary, but Noon disagrees. Beludar is thankful nonetheless.

## The [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md)

The party heads out in search of the [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md). Noon looks down the street, seeing a two storey building adorned with [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) flags (brown and green), both with "[Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md)" written around the respective [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) and [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) symbols. Ephaine recognises the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) military flags and intuits that the other is [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) leads the party over to the entrance, getting a proper look at the structure and its flags. As she leads the party inside a bell attached to the door frame rings, their arrival announced. [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md) whizzes over from behind the bar, moving at speed to greet the party. She does so jovially, introducing herself before checking for their [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md) which are self evident.

As Ahsha begins to explain why they're here, Reed interrupts her, insisting they are fed and watered well. She pushes them over to a table, motioning for them to sit. Ahsha isn't keen for another ale, asking for green tea instead. When she asks what they'd like to eat, Reed offers pumpkin pie, leek soup, or savoury beetroot pie. When Ahsha says she's not had the latter before, she disappears immediately to serve some, depriving Ahsha a chance to ask about [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md).

While she is gone, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) notice [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) and [Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) sat at a table in the corner. [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) is idly casting Druidcraft to manipulate a potted plant in front of him, no expression on his face. It appears to be a potted plant taken from a nearby windowsill. When Ephaine points out the people in the corner, Ahsha looks over, Weldira waves gently at her. It dawns on the party that they're wearing [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md).

Reed returns with a ceramic kettle, cups, a vessel of green tea leaves, and several slices of beetroot pie. She cautions Ahsha about staining her clothes on the beetroot.

Ahsha pushes through Reed's hosting, wary that she may be trying to hide something, but unable to tell. Reed insists that she takes care of them before talking business, but Ahsha perseveres, asking if she has seen any other [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) coming through here. Reed chuckles reflexively.

*[Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md):*
> You've not been here before, have you? We get [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) through here every other day.

Ephaine suggests that the inn probably has a ledger or other records of who has stayed. Reed admits as much, but is hesitant to share that information. She explains she is the inn's current host, querying why they are seeking this knowledge. Ephaine explains the mission they are on to find the lost [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md). While doing so Ephaine notices Reed's [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) badge pinned to her belt.

Reed points out that she is also a [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) based [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), causing Ahsha to question her credentials. She tells Ahsha that she's part of [Juniper Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/juniper-squad.md) who are currently back in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) while she remains here to host for a while. Ahsha asks what that means. Reed realises the squad hasn't been through [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) before, glancing at [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) and Weldira to share the bemusement. Reed gives a brief explanation of how the inn's hosting system works. Ahsha isn't familiar with it, nor is the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) expert Korina.

Ahsha asks Reed to check her records for the names of the [Kiln squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) members. As she lists off their names, [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) says at a normal volume that he knows them. Ahsha asks her over to the table, inviting him to partake in their pumpkin and beetroot pies. [Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) heads over without reservation, pulling up a chair and sitting close to the party before enthusiastically greeting them:

*[Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md):*
> Hi! So who're you lot?

Ahsha formally introduces herself, the squad, and her squad mates. Weldira beckons [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) over who comes over sporting a glum expression, bringing his potted plant with him. He looms large with his noticeable height, instinctively hunching as he goes, pulling a chair noisily behind him.

*[Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md):*
> Hi.

When asked, [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) tells [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) that he has met [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) north of here, where the road branches north and east, heading north. Ahsha questions if he was alone, [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) explaining that they were a party of four, but Scratch was the only person who provided a name.

At the comment that [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) were heading north, there is a forlorn look across [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)'s face as it dawns on her that their journey will likely take them to [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md). [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) looks suspiciously over the party, asking for their names again, pointing at them one by one and repeating their names as they are given (only first names are given). He introduces himself and Weldira by name.

Ahsha asks how long ago he saw [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md). [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) explains that the pair circle this area and muster out as they are needed, not able to recall exactly how long ago it was. He is able to tell [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) that they were seeking to reach the Neum Flats, [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) pointing them through [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) to get there. He also confirms that their direction of travel indicated that they'd came through [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md).

[Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) asks why they're looking for [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md). Ahsha and Ephaine explain that the squad has gone missing and it is their job to find out where they are or what happened to them, fearing the worst. Weldira is sad to hear that, hoping they're well. [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) continues to look around everyone at the table, soaking in their faces.

Ephaine asks Weldira if she knows which [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) legion is currently stationed at Fort Maloja. She tells Ephaine that she believes there isn't currently one there, having already made their way south for the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival at the start of the month.

## A Speedy Escape

Ahsha asks [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) if there is any more information worth trying to gain here or whether to make their way up to Fort Maloja. Ephaine suggests that they now know where to go next, so they should probably rest up tonight before tackling the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md).

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) realises that [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md)'s eyes keep darting around the party, but land and linger on her most often. This completely flusters her, causing her to panic internally. She informs [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) and Weldira that they'll be staying here tonight but need to retrieve their horses and wagon from [the Courteous Cow](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-courteous-cow.md) before returning here. [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md) comes over to question if they're leaving, but Ephaine is quick to reassure her that they'll be returning immediately, and she will happily pay now for two rooms. Reed also points out that they've not yet paid for their food and drink yet either, Ephaine also offering to pay. She pays 4 gp for all of the above.

Ephaine ushers [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) out of the door. [Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) rises to see them off. [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) remains sat staring at his potted plant, muttering almost to himself:

*[Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md):*
> Goodbye Ephaine.

Ephaine wishes him goodbye, trying to hide her nervousness. As soon as she is outside she charges along the road, Ahsha running after her to question what's going on. Ephaine tells the party that they need to leave town immediately and that she'll explain once they're on the road. Ahsha agrees with her vibe check.

She then asks Ephaine if they should gear up for cold weather based on how far north they're going. Ephaine assures the party that first frost should be a while off yet, so they should still leave immediately. A small amount of time is spent buying two weeks of feed for both horses, [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) paying 12 sp for the mountain of grain sacks and getting them into the back of the wagon.

Ephaine takes the reins, guiding the horses and wagon out of the stable and to the north. As they exit the stable and turn the corner in the middle of the town, [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) notices [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) and [Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) standing a bit closer up the road from [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md), watching the party as they skip town.

Ahsha points out the weird vibe in this town again. Ephaine believes it's the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) they just met rather than the town, noting that [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) seemed to be familiar with her name. She suggests using a decoy name for her for the time being, a full explanation of what's going on still promised further up the road.

## Heading North

The party rides north out of [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), seeing a forest to their east as they go. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) notices the coming hills ahead, but before they reach them it becomes night. Without talking to anyone about it, Ephaine casts Darkvision and presses on, wanting to get more distance from the town they departed from. With the sun disappearing behind the mountains to the west, a cold snap sets in and the horses begin to tire.

Ephaine apologises for pushing the horses so hard and begins looking for a spot to camp for the night. She finds a spot between two gentle hills on the east side of the road, overshadowed by the nearby trees. She casts [Pas](../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md)s Without a Trace before pulling the wagon off the road and out of view, settling in a spot where the road is visible from only a short walk away. Ahsha asks Ephaine if they should avoid setting up a campfire. Ephaine agrees that they shouldn't, wanting to remain concealed.

After helping the horses settle, Ephaine returns to the camp to settle down. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md), not struggling with the cold, drifts off to sleep quickly.

*See: [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)*

Ephaine begins to recant her backstory. She notes that she's from [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md), the village they're heading towards. She talks about her early life as a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) and the tumultuous circumstances that forced her out of her home. She points out that she's not been able to return home since leaving, not knowing what happened to her family in the wake of her disappearance.

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> ...so I'm not sure what's going to be waiting for me there.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md), appearing to [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) nearby:*
> What indeed.

Ephaine makes it clear she's happy to answer follow up questions but didn't feel safe with the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md). Ahsha asks if they can expect to bump into the families of the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) she killed years ago, but Ephaine is confident they won't, as all of the soldiers were from elsewhere in the kingdom. She is more concerned about what the other villagers will think about her. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) hopes that the villagers they come across won't be a fan of vigilante justice.

Ephaine asks that the party calls her **Helga** when talking with strangers, wanting to keep her identity secret.

## Ephaine and Noon Stay Up

She offers herself for first watch, Noon offering to join her as quiet moral support. During the night Noon is mostly concerned with keeping an eye on Ephaine and trying to read how she's feeling. Ephaine meanwhile is hyper away of her surroundings, quite jumpy at the occasional Noon movements.

During this watch, [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears to Noon, walking over to Ephaine before sitting next to her.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> She's just a child. Don't let the badge fool you.  
> I think before long that part of her life will be behind her.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> We shall see, dear sister.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) remains throughout Ephaine's watch.

Noon asks Ephaine about her childhood, trying to get her to talk about happy childhood memories. She tells Noon that it was a simple country life with a strong [cepine](../lineages/cepine.md) cultural upbringing away from the trappings of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). Her mother was good with navigating the terrain, her father was great with the animals and showed her the stars and how to navigate with them, before she ruined everything.

Ephaine reckons Noon has a wonderful affluent upbringing that makes hers look dull. Noon strains a warm smile before telling Ephaine that she would be surprised - his upbringing was one of learning from dusty professors or being alone.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Not really.

Ephaine apologises for assuming that Noon had it easy.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Fate has a way of putting trials in front of all of us.  
> All we can do is decide how we deal with them.

Ephaine tells Noon that she appreciates Noon staying up to chat with her and keep her company. Noon tells her that it is no bother.

During her watch, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) hears multiple owls at the forest line hooting. She assumes they are no more than the normal wildlife of the area.

## Ahsha and Noon Stay Up

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) then takes over from Ephaine, Noon staying up to keep her company too. Her watch is uneventful until the darkest part of the night where she hears a wolf howling in the distance to the north. It is followed by several hours of wolves howling in communication across the nearby hills and valleys. The noise comes from different directions and is quiet, echoing greatly, suggesting they are very far away. She estimates 20 to 30 wolves can be heard. Neither Ahsha nor Noon detect any disturbance in the wolves, assuming they are just communicating normally.

Ahsha uses the opportunity to ask Noon about her shadow ([Nills](../characters/nills.md)). As she does so, Noon's posture stiffens, showing his discomfort talking on this topic. There's not a lot he is willing to say, explaining that the shadow has been part of him for as long as he can recall, and would say more if he could. Ahsha gets a sense that his lines are more rehearsed than he wanted to let on.

Ahsha asks Noon if the shadowy figure is always present, looking around for any sign of her. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears next to her, moving her head through Ahsha's. As her smoky semi-corporeal form passes through her, the smoke wraps around her head and reconvenes on her other side, a cold sensation briefly hitting the bottom of her spine. This startles her and makes her wary. Noon assures her that he will point out the shadow's presence when she is around.

Looking in a randomly wrong direction, Ahsha thanks the shadow for keeping the party and Noon safe. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) takes a bow towards her before dissipating. Noon stifles a smirk at [Nills](../characters/nills.md) playing with Ahsha without her knowledge.

The pair spend the rest of their watch talking about [Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md).

During this time [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) casts Scrying on [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md). She rolls 3 on her wisdom saving throw, allowing Allisa to observe [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)'s location.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## Heading for the [Pas](../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md)s

The party awakes to a frosty morning as first light creeps over the hills. Overnight nobody heard any traffic on the road. The party have breakfast and pack up their camp. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) resumes her role as the driver while [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) navigates. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) are in the back of the wagon.

The road north is straight and uninteresting, the forest remaining on their right the entire way. At one point they [pas](../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md)s a long since abandoned homestead made of crumbling cobbled stone.

After a while they reach the junction where the bottom of the actual [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) meets the easterly road towards [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), signposted appropriately:

| North | East |
| --- | --- |
| Fort Maloja<br>[Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) | Picdale<br>[Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) |

Ephaine is happy to find a route that the party can take home that will save them some time, bypassing [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) to reach [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) directly. After discussing with Ahsha, she continues north into the bottom of the valley.

## Archer Bandits Attack

Not long after proceeding past the junction, Noon and Korina spot two riders on horseback approaching from behind, slowly gaining on the wagon. Noon communicates telepathically with Ahsha and Ephaine to inform them of this development. Ahsha tries to look down the side of the wagon at them, spotting one horse with a rider. She advises Ephaine to keep the horses moving while she keeps a close eye on them.

Ephaine looks for a place to pull the wagon over, realising they have no chance of outrunning riding horses and feeling like if their intentions are pure, it is good road etiquette to move out of the way. She finds a good spot, pulling the horses over to the side and pulling on the reins for them to stop. They comply readily but complain in the process. Noon and Korina notice the riders gaining, speeding up in reaction to the wagon pulling off the road.

The party braces for potential combat. Ephaine keeps out of the line of sight just in case, Noon doing the same in the back of the wagon. Korina moves to the back middle of the wagon, taking a defensive position.

As the riders and their horses dip below an undulation in the road, everyone loses sight of them for a moment. As they re-emerge they can be seen stood up on their stirrups, longbows drawn.

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) casts Bless on everyone else as the first rider arrives on the scene. The rider fires two arrows at Korina. Both miss, one puncturing the wagon's fabric, the other hitting the wooden partition between the front and back of the wagon, catching Ephaine's attention. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) unleashes two Eldritch Blasts, both connecting with the rider, knocking several arrows out of their quiver, but otherwise leaving them undeterred. Noon hides behind Korina.

The second archer pushes his horse to get a side angle on the wagon. They loose two arrows, one at [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), one at the wagon's left horse. The first arrow impacts Ahsha's shoulder heavily while the archer fumbles the second arrow (natural 1).

Ephaine uses Starry Form: Archer, shooting at the first archer through the wagon, a bolt of magic shooting past Noon and Korina at close range, followed by a Guiding Bolt. Both shots blast into the archer who is now feeling worse for wear. Ahsha runs out from behind the horse, drawing her hand crossbow and shooting at the second archer but missing, letting the rage flow through her regardless.

Korina casts Toll the Dead on the first archer, pointing at them angrily while hitting her shield. The archer's eyes roll back from the necrotic energy that surges through their head. Korina follows it up by casting Healing Word on Ahsha.

The first archer turns their horse to the right, moving into the trees to come around and flank, hoping to break line of sight through the wagon. Noon casts Eldritch Blast right before they leave his line of sight. Encouraged on by Ahsha he connects with one of the blasts, knocking the archer from the top of the horse, barely clinging on and attempting to pull back onto the horse as they disappear from Noon and Korina's line of sight.

The second archer continues to flank wide, shooting two arrows at Ahsha. The second connects, inflicting another heavy wound, her anger dulling the pain.

Ephaine gets a view of the first archer who has barely pulled themself back onto their horse. She casts Guiding Bolt. It connects with him, knocking him unconscious as they slump backwards in the saddle. The horse continues on its way. Ephaine swings around, seeing the second archer and wasting no time casting Starry Form: Archer on them. She misses (natural 1), causing her spectral archer to loose the shot at just the wrong time, splintering a small area on the corner of the wagon.

Ahsha charges up to the second archer, brandishing her greataxe. She swings up at them, slicing through their leather armour and drawing first blood. She digs deep, pushing herself to swing a second time while the moment is right, connecting a second time. Korina jumps out of the wagon, casting Toll the Dead on the second archer, the sound of her shield being hit ringing right through them, exacerbating their physical injuries.

The first archer's horse, devoid of orders from its unconscious rider, turns tail and begins to run back down the road.

Noon jumps out of the cart and casts Eldritch Blast at the second archer, inflicting another injury. This causes them to turn tail and run, collecting another swing from Ahsha's greataxe as they turn. They order their horse to sprint back down the road. As they go, the archer fires two arrows at the first archer, aiming to finish off the riding horse out of spite, not wanting it to fall into their foe's hands. One arrow punctures the horse and kills it instantly, the second accidentally flies through the head of the first archer, finishing them off. The party looks on in shock as the archer betrays their fellow bandit.

Ephaine leaps from the wagon and moves to its back before letting loose a 3rd level Guiding Bolt. The beam of radiant energy streaks across the road in an instant, impacting the torso of the archer, creating a blast of light and blood mist. As it dissipates the party sees the smouldering torso of the archer drop to the floor while the horse takes off with their waist and legs still in the saddle.

*[Initiative order ends]*

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) unhitches one of the wagon's draft horses, heading back along the road in pursuit of the archer's riding horse, wanting to gain a third horse for [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md). Ahsha orders Noon and Korina to stay with the wagon before running off after Ephaine.

Noon and Korina head over to the first archer. Korina casts Spare the Dying but finds the archer completely dead due to the arrow through their head. Noon searches the body, finding:

- 8 gp 10 sp
- Longbow
- Quiver
- 10 arrows

Otherwise Noon finds no distinguishing marks or possessions that suggest an affiliation. He finds a string necklace with a doughnut shape of aromatic cedar wood tied into it. He is confident that nothing else was missed.

Ephaine reaches the horse which has slowed to a trot, following the road on autopilot. The waist and legs are still there, the back of the horse soaked in the archer's blood. Ephaine pulls alongside and grabs the horse's reins. It's slightly unwilling at first but tired, eventually giving in to Ephaine's pull. She leads the horse alongside her own back towards the wagon.

When she catches up with Ahsha she is disgusted at the gore on the found horse. Ahsha and Ephaine disentangle the archer's remains from the horse. Ahsha opts to walk rather than ride the bloody horse, citing her size and lack of riding experience.

Once back at the wagon, the party moves the bodies away from the road. Korina uses her cold breath weapon to flash freeze the corpses before cutting them up and distributing the pieces into the nearby foliage, helping to conceal the remains from prying eyes.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) hands the aromatic cedar necklace to [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md), asking her if it means anything to her. She examines it, finding it generically rural but not specific to any local culture. The pair postulate on why the archers would attack a full wagon of [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), worrying that they were sent to attack them. Their observations of the bodies (tiefling, half-orc) suggested they weren't particularly well fed. Ephaine is concerned that following their run-in with the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), this could well be orchestrated.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears as Noon is deep in thought:

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Well, there's not always a bigger picture [brother light](../characters/noon-schiller.md).

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Maybe so, but you can never be too careful.

*[Everyone: short rest]*

## Entering the Valley

The party takes to the road again. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) moves to the back to recover from her wounds, [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) taking her place up front as navigator. Noon is too distracted in thought to do his role properly. Ephaine's riding continues to be controlled and disciplined.

[Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) enters the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) proper, a bowl shaped valley stretching out before them, full of grassy plains with a gentle stream running through it. The sun begins to hang low to the west, barely keeping above the hills.

Noon is distracted by [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appearing on the draft horse in front of him, sat facing backwards, starting into his eyes.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> [Brother light](../characters/noon-schiller.md), do you believe in destiny?

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I try my best not to.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> A fair answer. And what about this lot, what do you think?

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I hope they'll be fit for purpose.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> For once I'm not speaking of us.  
> There's something out here in these mountains. I think it's only a matter of time until we find it.  
> Will you play your part?

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Indeed dear sister.  
> Have I ever failed to in the past?

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Not yet brother, not yet.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) dissipates, the motion of the horses and wagon forcing her smoke to [pas](../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md)s directly through Noon. He tries to hold a plain expression as this happens, but Ephaine has noticed that something about Noon seems off. She encourages him to keep an eye on the ridge lines as they go.

As the sun sets over the hill, Ephaine hears the sound of a large wolf howl that reverberates through the valley. Both Ephaine and Noon search the hills for signs of wolves. Both spot a wolf to their right on the top of a hill, its back arched to howl into the air. They can tell that it must be a large wolf for its size based on its distance from the wagon. Noon spots spiny protrusions on its back. The pair piece together that it is a dire wolf.

As they listen to the dire wolf howling, 30 to 50 wolves howl back from deep into the valley. Ephaine recognises the reputation of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) valley as being full of wolves during the autumn, making it a dangerous place to traverse.
