## Pre-session

### [Inspiration Pool](../mechanics/dm-inspiration.md)

2 dice.

## Exploring [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md)

Having just left the [Hyceodd Trade Post](../places/buildings/stables/hyceodd-trade-post.md), [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) find themselves on the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) just inside of the [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) town walls.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) suggests the party go for drinks. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) asks [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) if the third [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) ([Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)) explained where she would meet the party in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), but Saoirse only recalls Allisa saying that she would try to meet them there, with no specifics arranged.

Thanea agrees with [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s suggestion of a drink. She comments that Saoirse hasn't been drinking to access recently, a sentiment she agrees with, though she disagrees that her drinking was ever a problem.

The party makes their way to the right, heading towards the town centre. Horses and carts move along the busy road, the muddy road getting splashed up and rutted after yesterday's heavy rain. Proceeding along for a while, the party surveys the large open space that the road emerges into. Thanea has mud splashed into her eyes from a passing cart, preventing her from seeing much. She stumbles, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) helping her having narrowly dodged the mud herself.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) looks upon the [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) marketplace, recognising an Order of the Diamond temple at its centre ([Temple of the Resistance](../places/buildings/temples/temple-of-the-resistance.md)), its corners pointed down the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) in both directions. She also sees the [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) market on the right (northwest) side of the marketplace. Additionally [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) spots the four doorways on the temple and the [Hyceodd Astornox Stronghold](../places/strongholds/hyceodd-astornox-stronghold.md) to the left. She points out what she sees to the rest of the party.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) flags down a gnome commoner, asking him what the building is. He states that it's the [Temple of the Resistance](../places/buildings/temples/temple-of-the-resistance.md). When [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks him what resistance it refers to, the gnome gives her a dumbfounded look before informing her that it is a tribute to the [Astor-Syntenne War](../history/events/astor-syntenne-war.md) and the Astor resistance efforts when [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) was under the control of the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).

## Investigating the Temple

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) suggests the party go into the temple. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) asks what Torbra expects to find in there, as they are unlikely to find drinks in a temple. When she insists on sating her curiosity, [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) suggests that [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) might be waiting for her and Thanea there. The entire party decides to follow Torbra.

Approaching the doors, Torbra spots the symbols for the four insider [gods](../gods/gods.md) above each door (left to right: [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md), [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md), [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md), [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md)). Each party member steps through the door of the god they pledged to when they joined the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Saoirse is particularly curious about which door [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) intends to step through. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is dismissive at her choice, not putting much faith in [gods](../gods/gods.md). Saoirse expresses her matching sentiment, explaining that the most religion she's been exposed to was devout clients of her mother.

Stepping through the doors, the party observe the temple interior which is typical for an Order of the Diamond temple, with statues to each of the [gods](../gods/gods.md) in their usual places. [Brother Verrick](../characters/brother-verrick.md) can be seen in the centre of the room, pushing rain water from the temple's oculus around, still dealing with yesterday's rain. A second figure can be seen praying at the shrine to [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md).

With the loud footsteps of the party echoing around the chamber, Verrick stops what he is doing and looks over to the party before making their way over.

*[Brother Verrick](../characters/brother-verrick.md):*
> Hello and welcome to our temple. Can I assist you in any way today?

Saoirse is dismissive while [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) points to Torbra, stating to her that it was her idea to enter. Torbra replies that she was simply curious. Verrick senses a lack of urgency or purpose from the party.

*[Brother Verrick](../characters/brother-verrick.md):*
> Well, thank you for stopping by. Our home is your home, so please, stay as long as you'd like.

The head caretaker bows, takes a few steps back, then turns and returns to brushing water from around the [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md) statue. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) criticises the architect who designed this place, her voice carrying around the chamber.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) heads over to the shrine of [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) where the second figure is praying. Torbra notices the person turn their head slightly in recognition of her presence, but nothing more. She looks upon the statue of [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md), a yellow-brown hawk made out of copper with less detail than its jewel-encrusted counterpart in [Diamond Prime](../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md). By contrast the head and beak is shiny and golden due to repeated touch from worshippers wearing it gently.

Torbra, seeing the wear on the beak, touches the statue herself. When nothing happens, she turns and returns to the party before suggesting they go and get drinks as they originally intended. The party leaves in search of a tavern or inn.

## Resting At the Inn

It doesn't take the party long to find [Two Anchors House](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/two-anchors-house.md), on the north west edge of the marketplace, just round the corner from the right of the direction they arrived from. It is a large building with a wrought iron sign out front, clearly denoting its purpose. Everyone heads inside.

Inside they find a large floor plate with views of the upper floor mezzanines, as well as a bar on the far right hand wall. There are about 10 patrons on the ground floor, the tables at about half occupancy.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) heads over to the bar, finding [Curtis Donovan](../characters/curtis-donovan.md) behind the bar. She asks what special drinks are available, but Curtis laments that they're fresh out after a particularly busy night recently. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) pays for everyone's ales (4x 4 cp).

When Curtis notices [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) Squad Hand military badge, he remarks that there are more [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) heading through [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), and inquires what brings the party here. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) explains that they're heading up the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md), causing Curtis to remark that their work must be urgent if they're heading into snowy territory in late autumn. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) laments the length of their journey, but explains that they have no choice in the matter. Curtis compares their mission to his role as innkeeper, pointing out that he gets to see none of the world while stuck behind this bar, and is sick of having to throw people out.

Curtis points the party to tables on the ground, first, and second floor, as well as pointing out that there's currently nothing going on on the third floor. He offers food if party wants it, but nobody takes him up on the offer right now.

The party heads upstairs to the second floor. Here they find the floor mostly empty, noting a green scaled dragonborn conversing with a blonde haired gnome, the pair enjoying their meals and each others' company. They also spot TODO sat alone facing away from them, nursing a drink.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) picks a table by the railing overlooking the ground floor, a view that is only achieved by leaning over the railing. Everyone else sits at the table. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) places her map ([Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md)) on the table and unrolls it, keeping her hands on it to stop it from rolling back up. She poses the question - does the party go directly to the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) or via [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md)?

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) has [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) recant what the benefits of heading through [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) would be, Saoirse stating that Elysia pointed them to [Gate To the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) as a means of acquiring information about the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) wonders if they can't just find out about the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) here in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). Saoirse isn't convinced judging by the hole in the temple's roof, though [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) retorts that she hasn't been to many places with a four storey inn. Thanea is keen to ask as much as possible, pointing out that [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s last mission didn't go well in part because they rushed head-first to the Humar Estuary without doing their research first.

## A Guest at the Table

While conversing, [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) see the hand of TODO place his mug on the table between them while he pulls a chair over to sit on. As he says hi, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks what he thinks about the discussion they're having. TODO has no idea what she's on about, prompting her to voice her assumption that he sat down because he was interested in their conversation.

TODO is confused, stating that he came over to join the party because they looked interesting and he wants to make new friends. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks what he knows about [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md). TODO recalls that it is a town set between two lakes, a mostly farming community. She then inquires about [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md), to which he is only able to say that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) army go up there and returned recently for the winter.

Jonwen extends a hand to [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), offering a friendly greeting and his first name. She accepts his handshake, naming herself "Clarissa" for the purpose of this social interaction, bowing politely while sat. Jonwen turns to Saoirse, asking her name. She follows [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s lead and names herself "Larissa", prompting Jonwen to smile at the oddity of their names.

*[Jonwen Cryss](../characters/jonwen-cryss.md):*
> Clarissa and Larissa! What are the chances?

Jonwen points to Saoirse's [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) military badge, asking if she's with the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), showing that he recognises the badge. Saoirse states that they all are. He congratulates them all on being able to join. Saoirse points out that they didn't have much of a choice in the matter.

*[Jonwen Cryss](../characters/jonwen-cryss.md):*
> Funny how we get caught up in things.

Saoirse asks what Jonwen's deal is. He explains that he works in the [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) marketplace and that his family owns some land north of here, making their money the hard way growing potatoes and parsnips, an honest living. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is appreciative, calling it an job that someone has to do.

Thanea and Saoirse find Jonwen's appearance and story incongruent, treating him with suspicion. They're able to perceive that his happy demeanour is genuine, but that he hesitated when beginning to recant his story, potentially betraying a half-truth in what he said, though they aren't certain.

*[Jonwen Cryss](../characters/jonwen-cryss.md):*
> Oh, where are my manners! Can I get you all some drinks, food maybe?

Jonwen offers the party anything they'd like to drink. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is happy with her first ale, and Thanea silently refuses the offer. Saoirse takes his offer, requesting a honey mead. Jonwen flags down the barkeep (female half-orc) at the back of this floor near the stairs, who then comes over to take his order. As Jonwen asks for honey mead the barkeep rolls her eyes, stating they have "something like that". Jonwen orders two, the barkeep disappearing to fulfil the order.

Jonwen relaxes back in his chair and eyes [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) up before asking where she's from.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> You know the big volcano out in the ocean?

*[Jonwen Cryss](../characters/jonwen-cryss.md):*
> Not intimately.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Pretty much the bottom of that thing. That's where I came from.

*[Jonwen Cryss](../characters/jonwen-cryss.md):*
> Well, quite the journey to end up somewhere like this. But as you say, you're in the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md)!

## Abrupt Session End

*At this point [Sam](../players/sam.md) excused themself from the session due to not feeling well. We decided not to continue the session without them, opting instead to continue next week.*

*While the original intention was to resume the conversation with [Jonwen Cryss](../characters/jonwen-cryss.md) next session, I instead decided to move the party on from [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) to further their [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission. As a result it was described to the players that their conversation with Jonwen peters out and he excuses himself, leaving them alone.*
