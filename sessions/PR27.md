| Character | Dialogue |
| --- | --- |
| [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) | All as one. All as one.<br>Darkness. Creaking. Darkness. Skittering.<br>Squawk. Squawk. Scraping. Scraping.<br>A head turns. An arm flexes. A chain rattles. Rattles. Rattles.<br>A light! Pillar of light fast widening. Filled by shadow. A man. Unsure, a person.<br>Descending. Descending. Flash and flicker. Stern face. Leather and steel.<br>Chains and bricks. Flesh and chains. Red skin. Purple skin. Yellow skin. Green skin.<br>Limp hands. Gravity's burden. Wooden floor. Crimson lake.<br>One, two, three. Incomplete sequence. Where is four? Incomplete. Incomplete. |
| [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) | He's alive. He's chained up somewhere dark. I think they've taken one of his legs. I couldn't make out the person who came to check on him, but there was one thing distinctive - a scraping bird call. |
| [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) | Like a bird of prey? |
| [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) | I don't think so. It sounded angry, but not aggressive. |
| [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) | A magpie protecting its nest? |
| [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) | Perhaps. |
