*This session was moved to Thursday due to a scheduling conflict with [Robin](../players/robin.md).*

## Pre-session

### [Inspiration Pool](../mechanics/dm-inspiration.md)

2 dice.

## Staying At the Inn

The party remains in [Two Anchors House](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/two-anchors-house.md) in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) after [Jonwen Cryss](../characters/jonwen-cryss.md) excuses himself for the evening. They rent two rooms for the night.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

The gentle sound of drizzle wakes the party. They head down for breakfast, partaking of the inn's famous smoked sausages with salad on the side.

## Searching for Allisa

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) questions [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) about [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), wondering if there's any final steps they can take to locate her before leaving [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). Thanea questions what she looks like, Saoirse recanting her armoured appearance from their dream ([Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)) while using Minor Illusion to try and help, though the pair doubt that she would be lurking about town looking so inconspicuous.

The pair rope [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) into the search. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) isn't sure why she should help, pointing out that Saoirse's description that of a group of [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) standing outside of the [Hyceodd Astornox Stronghold](../places/strongholds/hyceodd-astornox-stronghold.md). Collectively the party realises how ridiculous their search is and how little they could say to strangers about Allisa that would make any sense.

The party splits up and spends an hour searching in and around the marketplace, to no avail. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) finds a male half-orc in scale mail and a helmet with a gruff voice who shoos her when she attempts to be friendly with her. He gets irate when he notices her [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) military badge, telling her to "piss off".

When the party reconvenes, Saoirse briefly considers trying to leave a message for Allisa at the inn, but Thanea talks her out of it. Saoirse realises that the entire search following magical messages in her head has impaired her judgement, and decides to simply drop the search and move on.

## Preparing to Head Out

The party once again decides where to head next - [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) directly or [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md). [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) wonders if the pass will be cold and merit buying winter clothing, prompting a discussion about whether to stock up on supplies now or at [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md). The party resolves to head via [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), Thanea reminding everyone that [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) suggested going that way. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is dismissive of Elysia's suggestion, not taking it as concretely as Thanea is.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) suggests going back to the [Hyceodd Trade Post](../places/buildings/stables/hyceodd-trade-post.md) to look for a delivery to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) as their means of transport. Leading the party back there, she strikes up a conversation with [Upton McAran](../characters/upton-mcaran.md) who is in the process of adjusting a horses' bridle inside of the large stable interior.

Upton recalls [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) (as "Bertha") who asks him for work. Upton offers her trade carts bound for [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) or [Yeatscale](../places/cities/yeatscale.md), neither of which are useful for [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s endeavours. Upton shouts to another stable hand (Jonas) to see if there is any cart bound for [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), but there isn't. Upton recommends trying again tomorrow. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks if he knows if work to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) is guaranteed, but Upton doesn't have specific information about timing, only frequency.

In one last desperate effort, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks Upton if he has anything headed through the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). Upton laughs, explaining that nothing goes through the pass this late in the year as first snow is due soon. Anyone who doesn't want to get stuck on the other side of the pass has already came south. When [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks what other options are available, Upton points her to another stable by the southern gate which will sell them horses or provide them travel by cart or coach.

Arriving there, inquiries are made, revealing the following prices:

| Destination | Method | Cost |
| --- | --- | ---:|
| [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) | Hired cart | 1 gp 8 cp |
| [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) | Hired coach | 2 gp 7 sp |

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) makes her preference for a coach known, preferring the higher class option. Everyone else is convinced, the entire party chipping in for the cost.

## A Coach to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md)

Their coach driver Gertrude (female halfling) opens the coach's swinging doors open and helps the party get situated before beginning to head south out of [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), keeping to the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md).

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) daydreams while watching the passing scenery while [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) keeps an eye out for [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md). She finds more guards than she expected, several sets on horseback as the day continues, noting their increased presence on this section of the road. As she sees each she slaps [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) on the leg (effectively playing "yellow car"). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) plays along, seeing three sets of guards before Saoirse does, slapping her leg each time. Saoirse then gets frustrated and gives up the game.

By late afternoon the coach pulls off from the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md), heading west towards [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) along the [Western Reach](../places/roads/western-reach.md). The road is immediately bumpier as the coach transitions from maintained gravel highway to a reasonably worn cart track.

A few hours later the coach driver pulls over at the side of the road, camping for the night. She sleeps on the roof of the coach in her sleeping bag.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

In the morning the party loads back into the coach and hits the road once again. Not long after resuming a trade cart comes the other way, prompting the coach driver to pull off the road to make space. As the cart passes she makes light conversation with the fellow road user, before resuming the party's journey.

By late morning the coach emerges from the trees, revealing [Blittergate Lake](../places/rivers-lakes/blittergate-lake.md) to the south, its glassy surface clearly visible from the coach window. After cresting a small hill a similar view of the much smaller lake to the north is seen, along with first glimpses of [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) set between them. Its small town centre of farm buildings and [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) stronghold tower clearly denote where the coach is heading.

On approach the party observes agricultural fields that are freshly ploughed following the autumn harvest, rough cobble walls delineating the landscape, and flocks of sheep grazing in grassy fields. Seeing the size of the town, Saoirse regrets not having bought winter furs in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md).

Arriving into the middle of [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), it dawns on the party that while [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) and [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) are both towns (and marked on a map equivocally), [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) is significantly smaller. As the coach reaches the T-junction at the town centre, the coach turns right twice, passing through the stable entrance of [The Courteous Cow](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-courteous-cow.md). She hitches up the horses in one of the stalls, helps the party disembark, thanks them for their patronage and then disappears into the tavern area to rest.

## Finding [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md)

The party debates which matter of business to start with or whether to split up. They collectively decide to stick together and try [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) first. Not knowing what to expect, Thanea characterises it first as an [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) building and then corrects herself, calling it an [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) stronghold. She reckons that information will be free, but [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) isn't so sure, speaking from experience.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) leads the search for [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md), accidentally heading north initially. She leads the party to the front of the [Blittergate Astornox Stronghold](../places/strongholds/blittergate-astornox-stronghold.md) where a pair of [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) ask if she is lost when they see her eyeing the front of the building up. She remarks that this isn't an [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) building, asking where she can find them. They explain that if they're anywhere, they'll be in [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md), pointing her round the corner to the western portion of the [Western Reach](../places/roads/western-reach.md). The guard remarks that an [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) is currently hosting, so there'll be at least one to talk to.

Heading back to the junction in the centre of town and then turning right, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) quickly leads the party to [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md), an inn-like building with a double door set diagonally into its corner. [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) flags flank the door, each with "GATE TO" and "THE WEST" painted above and below the associated [gods](../gods/gods.md)' logos.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) insists that [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) goes in first. Torbra protests, explaining that [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) forced the role on her. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) cautions [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), suggesting that they may all start praising her leadership, leading to her being made [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) dismisses the idea, telling Saoirse that the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) has already tried to do that but she turned them down.

## [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md)

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Eh, they've tried to do that before and it didn't work. I denied that stuff instantly. I'm not having responsibility over people.

Torbra complies, opening the door and leading the party inside. The interior is tavern-like and immediately warm. Tavern tables can be seen to the right, a staircase to the left, and a bar on the opposite side of the room.

[Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md), cleaning a mug behind the bar, turns to face the party as she hears the front door open. She hurriedly puts the mug down, lets herself out from behind the bar, and rushes over to the party to greet them.

*[Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md)*
> Oh well hello there! Come on, come inside, come on! It's lovely and warm in here!

Reed forcibly ushers the party into the interior, placing a hand on [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s back to move her out of the way of the doors so she can close them and keep the heat in. She remarks at the cold weather before formally welcoming the party and offering the party anything they need - food, drink, accommodation, conversation.

The moment Torbra mentions that they're here for a drink, she cuts her off, enthusiastically responding that she can get them ale, heading back to the bar to pour four ales without confirmation. She urges the party to take a seat.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> Well she's eager.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), nudging Torbra:*
> [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md), am I right?

Thanea is keeping an eye on Reed like a hawk, on high alert from the sudden forced socialisation. She notices an [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) badge clipped to her robe's belt. Everyone else notices [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) and [Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) sat on the large table furthest to the right hand corner of the room. Additionally [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) notices that [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) has a potted herb cutting in front of him. He has a bored look on his face as he wafts his hand back and forth over the plant, causing it to follow his movements.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) alerts Thanea to the presence of a blue firbolg, wondering out loud if he is from the same firbolg clan as [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). She notes that they've not seen many firbolg on their travels. Thanea has no idea, admitting she doesn't understand how their clan system works. Saoirse recalls [Rowan Great Sile](../characters/rowan-great-sile.md) who was a different colour, as well as that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s clan was from a forest.

*[Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md):*
> It's a small room, you know. We can hear everything you're saying.

Saoirse asks if they've said anything bad. Weldira replies that they've not, yet. Saoirse urges her to tell them if they do. Weldira can be seen whispering to [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md), noting that the party are [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) after having seen their badges.

The party take seats at the next table over, the other large table in the room. It seats two people at each side, two with the wall behind them, two backing onto the thoroughfare. Immediately Reed arrives with four tankards of ale. She asks if they'd like to start a tab, Torbra agreeing.

When Reed then offers to get them food, Saoirse asks what's on the menu. This causes Reed's face to light up with a huge grin. She offers a variety of sweet and savoury pies and cake. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) inquires about anything made with lemons, but Reed apologetically informs her that lemons are out of season. She then offers the party "a bit of everything to try", which Saoirse agrees to. Reed enthusiastically acknowledges her before dashing back to the bar, disappearing into a door to the kitchen area. After a moment the sound of pots and pans being moved loudly can be heard as she frantically begins preparing food. Saoirse states that she likes her, the experience reminding her of home.

Reed soon arrives with a wooden board topped with a bit of everything, warmed through to order. She slides it onto the table, motioning for everyone to move their drinks so she can slide the board into place. The board includes a cast iron skillet containing:

- Cottage pie, minus a slice, steam emerging from the slice hole. The top is golden brown.
- Beetroot pie, pastry on top. Two slices, oozing beetroot juice onto the wood, spidering into the gaps as it stains the surface.
- Pumpkin pie, square slab. Small crust at the bottom with an inch of pumpkin puree on top.

Reed sighs, feeling her job has been well done. She makes sure to point out that the beetroot juice will stain and won't easily wash out of their clothes, her nervousness giving away her prior experiences.

## Inquiring About the Pass

Saoirse interjects to ask Reed her name. She introduces herself as [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md). Saoirse thanks her for her hospitality, Reed accepting the compliment graciously, happy to serve "fellow [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md)".

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks Reed if she runs the place alone. Reed begins to explain how [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) is ran, explaining that no one person runs it. She notes that she is the current host until she decides to move on, the role then passing to another military person willing to stay in her stead or one of the [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) from the [Blittergate Astornox Stronghold](../places/strongholds/blittergate-astornox-stronghold.md). She describes it as a "fun little rest stop" that she passed through with her [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad ([Juniper Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/juniper-squad.md)), opting to stay when they returned to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), spending her two weeks of scheduled downtime here instead of in the city.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) then asks Reed if she knows much about the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md), but she doesn't. She notes that her [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad spends most of their time on the other side of [Blittergate Lake](../places/rivers-lakes/blittergate-lake.md), in the mountains near Mossband, or in the [Great Sile Woods](../places/forests/great-sile-woods.md), so south rather than north of here.

Saoirse asks if Reed has heard anything about the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) from other groups passing through. She mentions another [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad ([Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)) who passed through here 3 or 4 days ago, headed up that way. She notes that one of them ([Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)) seemed to be familiar with the area, which is fortunate as first snow is due soon, and it's not somewhere you want to get stranded.

Saoirse inquires about getting winter clothing while in [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md). Reed tells her that they should have no problem buying wolf pelt furs from the marketplace, and she can help them locate a seller if need be. Saoirse is appreciative of the offer.

Reed asks what [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) work is sending them through the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) at this time of year. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Saoirse are vague, describing it as exclusive research, which Reed accepts as a fine answer. She asks which [Astorrel Major](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-major.md) they work under, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) simply replying "Phenomena". Reed is impressed by this, humbly informing the party that she works under the Major of Forests "unsurprisingly", painting it almost as a default role.

*[Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md):*
> So is there some funky stuff going on up there maybe?

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Well, we'll see.

## Conversations With Reed

Reed realises that she is prying into sensitive business and relents, vocalising that she understands that they can't say any more on the matter. She is happy to have learned as much as she has. She asks them their squad name, prompting Torbra to identify them as "Skyfall Squad". Reed points out that she is part of [Juniper Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/juniper-squad.md).

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) remarks that she likes junipers, prompting Reed to share with a smile that one of her squad fell into a juniper bush on their first mission, leading to their squad name.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> It must be fun for them to know that they will forever be remembered for being a klutz.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> I mean, it's a good thing we didn't do that with all the stuff I've fallen into.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> We could have called it... what was it you fell into that one time, was it a ravine with nettles in it or something?

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> We'd have probably just been called "Prickly Bush Squad" or something. It would have been terrible.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) picks up on [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md) nervously laughing at her squad's name, choosing to deflect the conversation away from her. Reed then inquires about how the party came up with "Skyfall Squad". [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) makes up a story about [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) falling from the sky, "and that's all there was to it". Reed buys the story completely, finding it fascinating. Thanea buries her head in her hands from sheer embarrassment. Reed is astounded, lightly pressing for more details.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) gives up the ruse, pointing out to Torbra that she'd said that the squad wasn't named after some person falling. Reed is oblivious and cuts through the awkwardness, urging the party to tell her more if they choose to stay the night.

When [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) points out that she doesn't know the story because she was recently added to the squad, Reed asks which squad she was with prior. Saoirse and Thanea jump on the question, eager to learn something about [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s past. Saoirse puts extra pressure on why she's not with them any more.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) explains plainly that she was previously with [Aura Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/aura-squad.md), also under the Major of Phenomena, Spectral division. Reed hasn't heard of them, and Saoirse prods for more information. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) blurts out that they are about ghosts. Reed asks if ghosts are real. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) expresses that the higher-ups believe so at least. [Aura Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/aura-squad.md) were sent to investigate, but her vague wording hints that they didn't find any evidence.

Saoirse asks [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) what happened to the rest of her squad - did they "ghost" her? [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md) responds, thinking that Saoirse was talking to her, explaining that she enjoys both working closely with others and the independence that the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) affords her, giving her the opportunity to stay at [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) and meet even more new people. She relieved the last host who was heading back down to [Yeatscale](../places/cities/yeatscale.md).

Saoirse turns to [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), not wanting to miss the opportunity to grill her, asking her the same question.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Oh, you know how it is. Bandits show up, the rest of the group gets captured, they get killed, I go home, I get yelled at, and then I get thrown into a new group with you lot!

Saoirse presses [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) on the implication that this wasn't the first time her entire [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) Squad were wiped out and she was the lone survivor. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) thinks for a moment, suggesting it might have been as many as three times, the rest of the party not sure how serious she is being. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) doesn't find it reassuring. Saoirse asks if she's haunted, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) only replying that she was put in [Aura Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/aura-squad.md).

[Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md) asks if she can get the party any more drinks, but they have everything they need. She explains that she'll be in the kitchen cleaning up, but they can just shout if they need anything. She absent mindedly repeats herself before stopping and awkwardly excusing herself, heading into the kitchen.

Saoirse asks [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) how long she's been part of the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md), to which she responds about 7 years. Saoirse doesn't find 3 squads in 7 years to be too worrisome in retrospect. Saoirse is sceptical but sees no reason to not believe her.

## The Local [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) Hunters

After a while of enjoying their food and drink, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) notices [Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) keeping an eye on the group. As she meets her gaze, Weldira waves to her to catch her attention.

*[Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md):*
> Erm... mind if we join you?

Weldira gets down from her chair, pulling it over to the party's table without grace. As she goes she ushers [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) to join her. After sitting down she says hi, then quizzically states that she thinks that she knows the group, asking if they were in the tournament ([Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md)). [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) confirms it. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) rolls her eyes.

Weldira introduces herself before pointing to where she expects [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) to be before glancing back over at where the blue firbolg is still sat, now angrily ushering him over. He slowly gets to his feet with a resigned "fine", grabbing the potted plant to bring with. He places the mint plant on the table before effortlessly sliding a chair across the floor, sitting next to her with a disinterested look on his face, not even introducing himself.

[Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) slowly glances around the table with intent, settling his gaze on [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) for a second before returning to everyone else. One by one he recants the full names of those he sees: [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md), [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md).

The table grows silent before [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) attempts to diffuse the tension with a joke, calling him a fan of theirs. Weldira apologies for [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md), calling his behaviour strange in the process. [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md), not knowing who [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is, stares at her intently. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) simply stares back. After a few seconds he returns his focus to the plant in front of him, casting Druidcraft again to manipulate it, including causing a white flower to bloom from a closed bulb. When he scrunches his fist up, it returns to its previous state. Weldira stares at [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) and the plant some before apologising again, struggling to find the words as she excuses him as "not usually the best company".

The party notices that the pair are wearing [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md) with golden strips on them, at least signifying that they belong to an officer rank, though which they aren't sure ([Astornox Magicborn Hunter](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md)).

Saoirse asks what brings two [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) here. Weldira responds that they're just patrolling, looking for trouble and troublemakers. Saoirse inquires about any recent events of interest, Weldira noting the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad that passed through and the recent storms, but aside from that, not much. She adds that a few weeks back Legion V returned through the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) for the winter.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks what they know about the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). Weldira explains that they typically patrol in a circuit between [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) and [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) so they're not usually up that way, but she is able to describe a valley with a stream running through it that is typically populated by wolves at this time of year. Saoirse asks if she has any tips for keeping the wolves away from them, to which Weldira draws her daggers to show them off before sheathing them again. She states that they don't normally venture as far south as their patrol route.

Weldira elbows [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) to get his attention, asking him to tell the party about the other [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad. [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) frowns and stares off into the distance for a moment while everyone watches him expectantly.

*[Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md):*
> Humans. Half-orc. Dragonborn. Didn't stay long.

The party feel that the description is familiar, perhaps an [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad they know, but the presence of a dragonborn prevents most of the group from realising that this is [Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md). [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) has no such issue, having heard after the tournament that there had been a shuffle in which [Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) received a dragonborn [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md). Torbra states their squad name.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) declares that they sound like a load of bird watchers. Saoirse can't recall having met them, so the origins of their name remains a mystery.

Weldira asks the party if they know any of their names. Torbra is able to recall three of them: [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md), and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md), stating their full names. Weldira turns to [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) as the pair have a conversation that the party doesn't have the context for, the pair realising who they met several days prior and her relation to [Tamman Seren](../characters/tamman-seren.md):

*[Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md):*
> Ephaine..?

*[Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md):*
> Younger sister.

## What Became of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)

[Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) looks directly at [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) before asking tersely where [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> I'm not entirely sure where she is at the minute, but she was last inside a crocodile's mouth.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) urges Torbra to just tell [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) that she has passed, so she does. [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md)'s face remains unchanged but Weldira's fills with sorrow as she politely gives their condolences to the party. Weldira asks and realises that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s replacement within the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad.

Without warning [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) rises from his chair, grabbing the potted plant from the table. Without social graces he bumps his way past several chairs, seeking the high window near where he was originally sat. Here he sets the plant pot back where he found it. He grabs his backpack from their original table, putting it on.

[Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) is completely flustered as her fellow [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) Hunter is suddenly leaving. Stumbling over her words, she states that it looks like they're now going, and it was lovely to meet them all. She shouts for [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md), saying that they need to pay, the panic clear in her voice. Weldira begins dismounting her chair and gathering her things while [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) ducks under a roof beam and calmly walks over to the door. Without hesitating or looking back he opens it, steps into the street, then closes it behind him.

Weldira goes over to the bar in anticipation of Reed reappearing, looking back awkwardly at the party. Reed then emerges, a concerned look on her face. She asks Weldira if they're going, to which Weldira states that they are and that she will pay for the room that they'd already agreed to rent for the night, giving a clear indication that their leaving was not planned.

Weldira pulls 2 platinum coins from her coin pouch, overpaying her tab substantially as a form of apology for their hasty and rude leaving.

*[Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md):*
> Sorry. There... bye.

Reed can be seen looking down at the coins with a confused look across her face. She glances over at the party. Saoirse points at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and shrugs, Reed responding with crazy eyes that indicate she has no idea what's going on.

Weldira throws her bag over her shoulder, her hand crossbow digging into her back, causing her to readjust it. She passes the table on her way out, apologising again and wishing the party all the best while up in the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). Saoirse apologies if the party has upset [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md), but Weldira is dismissive, confident that it is simply [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md)'s social ineptitude getting them into a situation. Weldira heads for the door, shouts goodbye with fake joviality into the room, then exits quickly.

## What Just Happened?

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks what sort of [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) they were, noting that [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) typically have something to guard. She wonders if he was guarding the mint plant. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) remarks that [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) usually aren't that friendly in her experience.

[Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md) hurries over to the party's table immediately to figure out what just happened. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) recants [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md)'s quick exit. Reed states that they paid four times their bill, clutching the two platinum coins between her fingers.

*[Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md):*
> Further drinks on them, I guess!

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Saoirse are quick to voice their lack of objection. Reed offers them a stronger drink. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks how strong, prompting Reed to offer spirits. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) voices her anticipation at a fun night ahead.

Reed puts the coins into a button up purse attached to her belt, muttering to herself as she returns to the kitchen. After entering she briefly pops her head back out.

*[Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md):*
> Oh, and to answer your question - they're [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunters.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), to the party:*
> Imagine running away, as a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), and you get chased by a blue cow. I'd just give up at that point.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) doesn't immediately make the connection from blue cow to firbolg, and Saoirse voices her objection, finding the remark derogatory. She compares it to calling [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) a "fucking devil". [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is unfazed at the notion, not caring what Saoirse thinks. It is clear from Saoirse's comments that she has developed a fondness of firbolgs through [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).

## Staying in [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md)

The party opts to remain at [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) overnight, taking up [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md)'s offer of free drinks for the rest of the night. Everyone except [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) drinks to excess, visibly drunk by the time they turn in for the night. Reed still makes them pay for their own rooms (5 sp each).

*[Everyone: long rest]*

By morning the party head to the small marketplace that lines the eastern portion of the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) in the middle of [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md). They aren't successful in finding someone to sell them winter furs, so they return to Reed for the help she offered. She inquires at a fish vendor, finding that the fur vendor hasn't set his stall today. She is able to take the party to his house where his stock is stored, and buy from him directly.

| Character | Item | Price |
| --- | --- | ---:|
| *Everyone* | [Clothing, cold weather](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/clothing-cold-weather) | - 2 gp |
| [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) | Climber's Kit | - 25 gp |
| [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | Waterskin | - 2 sp |

Saoirse takes her new waterskin back to Reed who fills it with grain alcohol for free. This gives her a waterskin with 6 sips of strong alcohol, each enough to make her tipsy.

The party inquires at [the Courteous Cow](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-courteous-cow.md) stables for transport north. They observe that there are four horses for sale, but no cart driver in [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) is willing to take them to or through the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) at this time of year. With few available options, the party opts to tackle the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) on foot.

Saoirse takes a moment while at the market looking for [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), but she doesn't find anyone matching her description. She once again briefly considers asking someone for help or leaving a message, but thinks better of it, still feeling it is too risky.

## Heading North

[Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) departs [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) to the north, beginning their trek along the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) road. The small lake to the east gives way as a treeline replaces it. They continue as the terrain either side of the road becomes slightly hillier.

By late evening they arrive at a junction in the road, a trail heading off to the right, eastwards. A signpost labels the nearest settlements in each of the three directions:

| North | East | South |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md)<br>[Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) | [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md)<br>[Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) | [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md)<br>[Yeatscale](../places/cities/yeatscale.md)<br>Mossband |

It's clear to the party that they now stand on the edge of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md), on its southern entrance.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) casts Scrying on [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), seeing her by the signpost, knowing her exact location and learning where she is heading based on the body language of her party.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) casts Tiny Hut along the roadside, giving the party a safe spot for their overnight camping. As the last of the sunlight fades from view and darkness overtakes their surroundings, nobody is able to hear the sound of large packs of wolves howling in the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md).
