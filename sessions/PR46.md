## Pre-session

### [Inspiration Pool](../mechanics/dm-inspiration.md)

1 dice.

## Licking Wounds

[Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) continues to converse with [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) after fighting alongside each other against three [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md). A large crashing sound was recently heard from [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md), a cliffside collapsing as the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) consumes more organic matter to grow in strength.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) asks the party if they can move somewhere safer, still nervous at the prospect of more of [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) present nearby. Allisa asks where they should go instead, Saoirse simply asking to go anywhere else. Allisa isn't sure where the best place to go is, not familiar with the area except for a small village to the north ([Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md)).

Saoirse asks if anyone has the ability to heal her wounds. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) indicates that she has little more magic to use, while [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) points out she has no such ability. Saoirse advises Torbra that the party should invest in healing potions once back in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md).

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) offers her magic, casting Prayer of Healing. She closes her eyes and places a hand to the [Citrine Eye Necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md) around her neck, a burst of radiant light emitting from it before it pulses outwards, washing over everyone present, a pulse of healing magic. She takes a pleasant deep breath as the spell ends.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I hope that helps some.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> I feel better already!

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> Do you reckon you can teach one of our party that? It's very handy.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> It's an advanced piece of magic, it took me quite a while to master it. It's called Prayer of Healing.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Hm. I'm not to usually pray, but it comes in this handy, I'll give it a try.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> You'd be surprised...

As Allisa puts her hand to the necklace again to honour [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) for helping her, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) sees her touch the necklace, glimpsing a yellow coloured pendant at its end.

Saoirse asks Allisa if she's okay, who responds that she took some hits but is feeling better now, having it in her to "go another round", her magic not yet fully used up.

## How To Approach the [Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md)

When Saoirse suggests the party investigate the crashing sound they just heard, Allisa asks her to wait a moment. She proceeds over to the closest pile of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) left behind by the dead [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md). She empties her coin pouch into another side bag, leans down and pushes some of the dust into it clumsily before pocketing it.

Thanea suggests the party do the same, noting that returning with evidence is a goal of their [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission ([Search for a Meteorite in Tresenda Pass](../storylines/search-for-a-meteorite-in-tresenda-pass.md)), Saoirse agreeing. Thanea continues, stating that they need to continue their search for the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md), but should probably rest first due to the state of her magic. Saoirse expresses her same issue. Allisa offers to help in any way she can, but she can't restore their magic.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) collects a pouch of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md).

Allisa can be seen pacing back and forth next to one of the piles of dust, her staff and shield lowered by her side. She is deep in thought about the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md), trying to think harder on what they could be, worried for the safety of Saoirse and Thanea.

Thanea offers to use Radiant Soul to fly up and look for a crater, but needs to sleep before she can do so again, an idea that Saoirse supports. Saoirse wonders about the crashing sound, Torbra point out that it likely came from the northeast, despite the sound echoing around the valley. Thanea asks if it's possible to move around it rather than directly towards it. Torbra isn't convinced due to the topography of the surrounding hills.

Torbra suggests that the sound may have been another [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) falling. Thanea isn't convinced, recalling her dream of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) impacting ([Thanea Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-thanea-1.md)).

Allisa questions Thanea's assertion that there are more of these creatures, stating that she might be able to find them (Locate Creature). Thanea explains that last time they fought creatures like this their numbers differed, and so she is concerned that until they find the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), she isn't sure how many there will end up being.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> So do you think this is spreading, like some sort of disease?

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> I'm not sure. Once the creatures turn to dust it doesn't seem to do anything, but it seems like it infects at least the host. We've seen a guy get practically eaten by it and turn into a creature.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Let's not forget that I got corrupted by it as well.

Allisa turns her head to Saoirse quickly, her surprise penetrating her full face helmet.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> If we ever run into any of the [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), don't touch them.

Thanea recants Saoirse falling on the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) and alludes to the insidious effects that corrupted her thereafter. Saoirse is quick to correct her, pointing out that she leapt on it to try and affect the outcome of that encounter.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) mimes pulling out some paper and writing on it, finding Saoirse's suggestion not to touch unknown and dangerous things obvious.

Allisa notices [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), so she puts her on the spot, asking what her stake in the mission is. She makes it clear that she's new to [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and hasn't seen these creatures before prior to day, but characterises them as dangerous. Saoirse complements [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s fighting prowess in the face of such danger, though [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is dismissive, stating that she didn't feel like she did much. Torbra asks if she could have upped her game, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) retorting that they appear to be unaffected by most of her magic. Saoirse imitates [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), pretending to write down that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) doesn't put up much of a fight, unimpressed by her effort.

## Scouting Ahead

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) suggests the party investigates the crashing sound, offering to scout ahead. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) worries for her safety, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) asks if she has a way of doing so safely. Allisa looks across the party, deciding who would be best suited to take with her. She suggests that if the party want to scout now, she can take them, pointing to the top of the closest hill which overlooks both the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) and [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md), located south east of the incline into the bowl valley.

Saoirse questions what she means, asking if she can take everyone. Allisa states that she can only take one, using the method by which she arrived here in the first place:

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> You saw how I arrived, right?

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Not really, I was busy not dying.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), sighing:*
> Ugh, do they not teach you guys anything any more in the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md)? It's a Dimension Door, people.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> To be fair, we were only there for three weeks.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Wait... you guys were only there for three weeks?

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> Yeah, we were special enough to get fast-tracked.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), to herself:*
> The hell did I get put up with?

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> I mean, we were there for three weeks and then almost won a tournament, so I'd say you're pretty lucky to be with us!

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) brings the conversation back on track, asking if anyone volunteers. Allisa cautions that she can't return back down the same way without resting. Torbra asks if it would be better to rest before continuing in that case. Allisa says that there both risks to staying and going, implying that they must choose carefully. She washes her hands of the responsibility of choice, calling herself a stranger intruding in their mission.

Torbra suggests the person with the best vision should go. Both Thanea and Saoirse state how bad their vision is. Allisa looks to Saoirse, having already made up her mind.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> That's a shame. It helps in places like this to have eyes like a hawk.

Allisa tucks her staff under her shield before extending a hand towards her. She excitedly accepts, taking her hand. Allisa pulls on her hand, directing her to stand at her side, positioning her carefully. She grabs her staff again before putting her shield on the metal hook protruding from the back of her armour, fixing it in place.

Allisa tells Torbra that scouting won't take long but it'll be a while before they return. Torbra tells them to stay safe. Saoirse looks towards Allisa, closer than she's ever been to her before. Looking through the eye slits of her visor she can make out the shape of eyes, but is unable to make out any further details.

Allisa grabs Saoirse's hand firmly again, asking if she's ready. Saoirse is, nervously saying goodbye to the party. Allisa uses her staff to trace the the three sides of a door frame open, a white trail of light left hanging in the air as she goes. She pushes at the space in between, a magical door pushing open, its face bending light like a mirror as it moves, hinged on the space around it. Saoirse sees clouds and rocks below in the space being opened up. She feels the pull of Allisa's arm as she begins to get pulled towards the door forcefully. Allisa pulls Saoirse who begins to laugh as the pair pass through the door quickly, the door closing immediately behind them, the white outline vanishing. The pair are gone.

As they arrive on the hilltop, the pair fall a foot down, the door not having been perfectly aligned with the ground up here. Allisa stumbles but quickly finds her footing, throwing her arm around Saoirse to stop her from tumbling. Saoirse goes over quickly, causing Allisa to commit to grabbing her, the pair tumbling to the ground. Allisa rolls over the top of Saoirse before the pair come to a stop amongst the rocks.

## Left Below

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) look up at the hilltop that [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) pointed at, not seeing the pair. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) immediately decides to rest, casting Tiny Hut for the three, creating a comfortable dome away from the cold morning. Mist still hangs in the valley but is quickly burning off. Nearby the sight of six carbonised trees from the earlier battle are striking.

Torbra, unhappy with how difficult the fight against the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) was, passes her time by shadow boxing, wanting to improve.

## The View From Above

As [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) get up, the reality of where they are sets in - it is freezing cold, frosty, and a mountain wind passes right through them, chilling the pair quickly. The ground is covered in jagged rocks with only moss growing in covered gaps, underlying the stark difference in conditions between here and the valley floor.

Saoirse thanks Allisa for trying to stop her from falling, Allisa hard on herself for not being able to stop her from tumbling. Saoirse is forgiving, explaining that she is clumsy, recanting falling into a prickly bush in the [Hawkswood](../places/forests/hawkswood.md). Allisa advises she watches where she is going.

The pair look around to orient themselves and to look for signs of a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater. Saoirse understands where this hill is, seeing the valley floor down to the south, first spotting the burned trees followed by [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s Tiny Hut, far below. To the north she spots [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md), a bowl shaped valley with mist hanging low in it, obscuring most of its features. She is able to perceive a change in the colour of the grass at the lip of the slope that ascends into the valley, seeing it brown before it descends into the mist. Pointing it out to Allisa, Allisa suggests it could be burned grass, Saoirse wondering if that means a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) landed here and burned the surrounding area.

Feeling cold, Saoirse pulls out her winter clothing from her bag. As Allisa spots the fur lined coat she remarks that the party is well prepared. Saoirse explains that one of their party members died recently, so this time they are better prepared. Allisa offers her condolences, asking for their name. Saoirse tells her that she was called [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Since coming here I've lost two: Castien and Xavier.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> I'm so sorry for your loss. Were they fellow spies? Is it okay to say that?

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> It's the truth, isn't it? They were.

Saoirse calls being a spy a job like any other, carrying its own risks.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Well, as you know it's hard when you're there and you try your hardest, but you still can't save them.

Saoirse empathises with Allisa, watching her clench her fist around her staff, her leather gloves creaking.

Allisa points to [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md)'s mist again, asking Saoirse if she has any ideas about how to learn more from here, or whether they should try to head back. Saoirse states that the others will be safe inside of the Tiny Hut, so as she is exhausted, they should both rest up here before heading back down.

Allisa offers to let the others know, asking Saoirse what she should tell them. Saoirse asks her to explain what they've seen, characterising it as a burned spot that may be caused by a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). Allisa rolls down her right sleeve slightly, pulling at the end of the copper wire wrapped around her wrist like a bracelet. She creates a 1ft long horizontal line of wire in front of her, speaking over it gently while thinking of [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), Sending:*
> It's me. We're up the hill. We've spotted a burn mark in the valley beyond. Will be a while.

Thanea hears Allisa's voice in her head, thinking of a response. She simply asks if the party should wait for the pair or make their way to them.

Allisa lets go of the end of the wire as she deflates, frustrated. She tells Saoirse what Thanea's message was, stating that she doesn't have enough magic in her to respond to her question. Allisa begins wrapping the copper wire back around her wrist, doing so forcefully out of frustration.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) heads over to the edge of the hill and shouts down into the valley.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> We'll be down in a bit!

Her voice carries well, but the party are consumed by her own thoughts. Thanea and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) hear a feminine voice carrying on the wind from the east, but they can't make out words.

Thanea relays Allisa's message to [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Torbra, wondering if they should wait or head to them. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) states that they'll be fine, while Torbra continues shadow boxing inside the dome.

Saoirse, out of ideas, tells Allisa that the three will be fine without them. Allisa advises against making any more loud noises in case there are any more creatures in the valley that could hear and find them. Saoirse is disparaging, saying she often makes bad decisions. Allisa tries to cheer her up by telling Saoirse that she often made many mistakes, and only years of experience changed her.

Saoirse asks how old Allisa is, explaining that she has no idea just how old she is. Allisa uses her staff to sit on a relatively flat boulder. She tells Saoirse that she is 129 years old. When Saoirse reacts with surprised, Allisa dismissively explains that she is barely an adult. Saoirse tells her that she is similar, only 17 years old. Allisa briefly points out that elves' minds develop quickly, but it takes many years to learn everything needed to excel in their society.

Allisa suggests they rest for a while to recover their strength. Saoirse offers her masculine clothing to Allisa who initially declines, pointing out that she couldn't wear them over her armour. When Saoirse suggests simply draping them around her neck, she does so, keeping the wind out.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) plays a song on her lute while she rests, providing [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) with the benefit of Song of Rest.

*[Allisa, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), Thanea, Saoirse: short rest]*

## Scrambling Back Down

After an hour, [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) notices the mist has cleared more from [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md), some still lingering at its very bottom. She points it out to [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) who notices the same "brown grass" (lack of any vegetation) extends throughout the entire bowl shaped valley, not just at the top of the slope leading up to it. Allisa comes to the same conclusion. Saoirse ponders the valley's shape, not feeling it is a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater, but still worth investigating.

Saoirse suggests the pair head back down now. Allisa asks if Saoirse has done much hiking before, Saoirse replying that the party does a lot of travel by foot as part of their roles in the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md).

Allisa leads Saoirse down the hill, leaping between large rocks with extreme skill and grace, at times dropping 15ft at a time to the next rock. Saoirse proceeds well but Allisa quickly vanishes in front of her, causing her to yell for her to slow down. As Allisa lands on her next rock, she pivots around on one foot like a ballerina, before apologising, suggesting that Saoirse leads instead.

The pair spend the next 45 minutes descending, the rocks giving way to grassy slopes that get increasingly gentle. It then takes another 15 minutes to hike back to [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s Tiny Hut and the rest of the party.

*[Torbra: short rest]*

Allisa and Saoirse arrive back at the hut, surprising the three who didn't notice them coming. Saoirse knocks on the magical dome, unable to enter or see within. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) tells her that she's not here, annoying Saoirse for a moment before ending the spell, dropping them dome.

Saoirse tells the party that she had shouted down to them but evidently nobody heard her. She adds that Allisa couldn't respond to [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s question, prompting Allisa to apologise for running out of magic. Saoirse is happy to have learned how Sending was cast, questioning the coil of copper wire again. Allisa explains it is a spell component.

When Saoirse asks if it is a spell that others can learn, Allisa goes quiet in thought for a moment, remembering her feelings that [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) helped her perform it for the first time.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Erm... some people can.

Saoirse expresses her wish to get in touch with her mother some time, having forgotten to write to her while in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) last. The party begins to chat amongst themselves before Allisa interrupts, wanting to talk business.

## Heading Up the Hill

She states what the pair saw from the top of the hill, their view into [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md). Like Saoirse she relates the appearance of brown ground, possibly burned, and the lack of a visible crater. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) suggests it could have been fire magic such as Fireball, pointing to the nearby burned trees. Perhaps the other [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad ([Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)) were fighting up there on their way through. Thanea urges the party to check the area out.

Saoirse asks if the party had a chance to rest. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) feels like she is, but Thanea cautions that her magical reserves are still practically empty. The party resolves to move out and investigate [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md).

Allisa once again sheepishly asks if the party are okay with her presence, not wanting to interfere in their work, pointing at Torbra's [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) military badge. Torbra states that she is already involved and should stay with them if she wishes. Allisa seeks Thanea and Saoirse's approval. Thanea would be thankful for backup after she saved them once already, Saoirse using the opportunity to call [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) ugly.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Besides, it will be a nice change from beast-face over there.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> You should look in a mirror once in a while.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Oh shush, I know I'm fabulous!

As the party sets off, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) takes the lead while [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) chooses to hang back and watch the rear. [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) chooses to stay near [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) also wanting to keep near Allisa.

Midday upon them, Torbra attempts to navigate the slope before them, the path a distant memory. She winds through the patches of tall grass, changing direction to avoid patches of mud and slicker grass, wet from the morning frost. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) pays more attention to Allisa who is clearly trying to keep her close.

## Making It Worth [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s While

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), realising [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) knows she is keeping close by, stops, allowing [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to catch up. As the pair meet she walks with her, starting a conversation without making eye contact. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) keeps her distance but tries to eavesdrop.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> So what can I do to make it worth your while to keep these two safe?

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> You know, gold gets boring after a while, and you seem to know about magic. You're not from around here either. Do you think you can hook me up with some magical items?

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> ... What would you like?

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Well you see this rapier I've got here? It's quite nice, but uh, I've heard about a nicer one, if you know what I'm saying.

Allisa makes it clear that she does, stating that it wouldn't be hard to find what she asks for. She makes it clear that if [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) helps keep the pair of [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) safe and doesn't cause them any trouble, she'll honour their arrangement. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) agrees.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) adds an advisory for Allisa - if the other [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) Squad are indeed in the valley beyond, she shouldn't open by telling them that she is a spy, warning that it won't typically go over well. Allisa makes it clear that "she isn't a child", annoyed at the implication that she'd reveal this to anyone. She makes it clear again that she is putting a lot on the line to meet and help Thanea and Saoirse, only wanting the best for them and to see this through, something she is confident they feel too.

Allisa confirms that it is indeed a magical rapier [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) wants. When [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) confirms, Allisa walks off without response, catching up with the others.

## Speaking With Saoirse

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) catches bits of their conversation, catching "gold", "worth your while", and "rapier". As Allisa arrives back at Saoirse in the matching order, she asks Allisa if she learned why all of [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s previous [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad mates died. Allisa says that it didn't come up. When Saoirse says that it's worrying, Allisa reassures her that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is fine.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Well, having you here helps.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I won't be here for long.

Saoirse asks her about her armour, suggesting that it must weigh a lot, and Allisa must therefore be very strong. Allisa states that it is lighter than it looks, causing Saoirse to put her foot in her mouth, making a sweeping statement about elves being good at making light armour and weapons. Allisa points out her racism, causing her to apologise, flustered and digging a deeper hole.

Allisa passes her shield to Saoirse, allowing her to try for herself. Saoirse finds it heavy, clearly made of metal, but has a density more akin to wood. She is impressed by how easy it is to carry. Allisa places her hand upon the top of the shield, implying she wants it back. Saoirse encourages her to go ahead. Allisa holsters her shield on her back again.

Saoirse apologies for what she said, explaining that she knows next to nothing about elves or the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Well there's a reason for that, so I don't blame you for it.

Allisa asks what Torbra's deal is, showing that she doesn't know her name. Saoirse provides it, explaining that Torbra is trying to figure her powers out, only recently learning what genasi even are. Allisa suggests she seems trustworthy enough, Saoirse calling her a good leader.

## Making It Worth Torbra's While

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) makes her way to the front of the marching order, keen to speak with [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md). She finds her right as she places her foot into a puddle of mud, warning her of it too late, to Torbra's frustration.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Look, I said I'd help you learn more about genasi. How would you like to meet some?

Torbra tells Allisa that she's already met two genasi already. Allisa points out that she knows other earth genasi who make it their business to know each other. Torbra asks what their intent is, Allisa characterising it as a sort of second family, suggesting that they'd surely be happy to meet Torbra. Allisa isn't sure how arranging that meeting would work, but makes clear her intention to try. Torbra likes the sound of this, happy to explore options with Allisa after [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) returns to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md).

Allisa points to Torbra's [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) military badge, wanting to confirm that she is their leader. Torbra confirms.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> At some point I'd like to take Saoirse and Thanea to [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md). I don't think it'll be soon, but... I still need to figure out how that'll work.

Torbra is open to the idea, but makes it clear that it is conditional on her agreeing and it being at a time when the squad isn't busy with a mission. Allisa finds her conditions to be fair.

Allisa thinks for a moment, wondering if she should offer Torbra any other incentive, but decides that the offer of meeting genasi should be enough, and Torbra doesn't seem to need much encouragement. Allisa returns to the middle of the marching order.

## Cresting the Hill

After an hour of ascending the grassy sloping hill towards [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md), several false horizons along the way, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) reaches its summit, the bowl shaped valley before her. She clocks the geography of the valley, appreciating it is miles end-to-end.

Torbra takes in her surroundings, noticing that the grass she is stood on looks dead at a glance, and that the valley before her is devoid of green. She crouches down to take a closer look, noticing that the grass on the hill's crest appears to have been cut. It is only an inch tall where she stands, each blade cut perpendicular, the part of the grass closest to the cut yellow-brown and dying. This is very odd for natural grassland.

Everyone else joins her at the crest of the hill except for [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) who hangs back. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) look out across the valley. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is distracted by what everyone else is doing. Saoirse notices the collapsed cliff face on the far end of the valley where it becomes the base of the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md), a shattered cliffside and subsequent rock slide looking untouched by erosion. She intuits that this must have been the source of the noise. Looking at the valley itself she finds that it is devoid of foliage, the grass stopping not far past the crest of the hill, only dirt and gravel to walk on. She spots the remains of a consumed tree, only its petrified trunk and the beginning of its branches remain.

Saoirse points out the cliffside, tree, and lack of grass to Torbra. She expresses that the valley gives her the creeps, Thanea agreeing. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) finds vague similarities to the slopes of [Karmox](../places/mountains/karmox.md), only in that it resembles the land after a lava flow, devoid of life before nature reasserts itself.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Well if anyone did set a Fireball off over here, I don't want to meet that person...

Torbra takes a few steps further forward, finding the edge of the grass, seeing for herself the void of life. After having waited a while for others to see with their own eyes, Allisa steps up, surveying the valley for herself.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> This looks wrong...

Saoirse relates to Allisa's feeling. Allisa points out that she has one more trick up her sleeve (Clairvoyance) that would allow her to view the valley without entering it, though she points out that it may well be the last of her magic for now. With nobody offering her advice, she decides to cast it.

## Allisa Sees the Crater

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) places a hand on [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md)'s shoulder before pointing her staff down into the valley, a radiant glow emerging from her eyes and through her face mask's eye slits. She stands motionless while Clairvoyance takes hold, allowing her to see down into the valley from close up.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), mouthed to Thanea:*
> She's so fucking cool.

Allisa starts to murmur to Saoirse and anyone else within range, giving a running commentary on what she sees through the censor.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> It's all gone, there's nothing here. There's dead trees, there's rocks, no grass, and dirt.

Allisa gasps for a moment, seeing the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) crater at the bottom of the valley.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I think your crater's here.

## Running to the Crater

As soon as [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) mentions the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) takes off running down [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md)'s bowl valley. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) shouts after her:

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Careful! We don't want another [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) accident!

As Torbra descends the hillside, she notices her surroundings become increasingly devoid of colour, getting a gut feeling about how dead this place feels. She notices the lack of animal sounds, used to hearing small birds or insects amongst the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) valley floor. The only discernible sound is of her feet against the gravel and dirt as she runs.

Torbra looks closely in the direction she is running. About a mile ahead at the bottom of the valley she sees a depression in the ground ([meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater), around 40ft by 60ft, surrounded in places by small cliff edges. In its bottom she sees pulverised gravel in a crater-like shape, a central depression with a mound on the farthest side suggestion a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) that came down at an angle, that trajectory captured in the impact crater.

Right in the middle of that depression at the crater's epicentre she spots a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), unmistakably spherical and dark grey. She continues running, shouting back to the group:

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> Found it!

Saoirse shouts back, warning Torbra of the dangers of handling the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) directly:

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Use protection!

Allisa squeezes Saoirse's shoulder.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I can see Torbra. She is running towards me... stop her, there's something here!

Saoirse shouts for Torbra to stop. She skids to a stop in the gravel, coming to a halt. Allisa tells Saoirse that one of those creatures is here and it's just turned to face Torbra. Saoirse continues yelling that she's not alone, then tentatively yelling that they're coming into the valley.

Allisa takes her hand from Saoirse's shoulder, ending the Clairvoyance spell before shouting as loud as she can into the valley.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Torbra! Get back here!

Saoirse sighs, telling [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) that Torbra is fucked if she doesn't come back now, and that they need to help her, before breaking into a sprint down the hill. Thanea sighs, running after her. Allisa swears in [elvish](../languages/elvish.md) before following suit.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Merde!

Torbra notices the party running towards her. She turns to face the crater again, spotting a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) walking across it, passing in front of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). As it does, purple glowing eyes form on its head, staring right at her.
