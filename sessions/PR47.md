## Retreating From the Crater

With [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) staring down a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) in front of what appears to be the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) at the bottom of the bowl shaped valley of [Upper Tresenda](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/upper-tresenda.md), the rest of [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) give chase, racing down the lifeless hillside towards her.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) casts Armour of Agathys on herself, preparing for imminent combat while running, leading the party down the hill.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) stands strong, equipping her halberd in preparation for the watcher's advance. She momentarily glances back at the party before turning to look down into the crater again, losing sight of the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) as it teleports out of sight. Torbra shouts back at the party, warning them that one of the creatures is here. Saoirse shouts back that they know.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) raises her staff and shouts, urgently demanding that she returns to the party. Torbra takes her seriously, running back up the hill. The party races towards each other, eventually reconvening in an area of barren hillside. They form a circle and begin figuring out their next steps.

Torbra explains what she saw - a [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) in the crater, seemingly protecting the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). Saoirse asks if it looked like the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) that the party recently fought, but Torbra describes it as smaller, without spines, and with purple glowing eyes. Saoirse recognises them as the creatures the party fought in the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md). Saoirse wonders if the two types of creatures are gendered. Torbra contrasts them with wolves, pointing out that wolves hunt in packs and wouldn't attack their prey by themselves. If these creatures are animals, this could mean there are more. Saoirse suggests placing the weaker members of the party in the middle of their marching order in case any meteorics attack.

Allisa glances around the landscape, expressing her distress at how alien it looks, wary of staying any longer than they need to.

The party looks down to the bottom of the valley, trying to make out a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). From over two miles away Saoirse spots the epicentre but no [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) is able to perceive it, its smooth spherical surface reflecting some sunlight and highlighting its presence to her.

Saoirse asks if the party should try and capture the watcher. Allisa won't have any of it, pointing out how dangerous they are and their ability to teleport. Saoirse suggests she still has some magic that could help, but Thanea is keen for everyone to retreat as they can always come back later now that they know where it is. Torbra agrees, convincing Saoirse that they should return once rested and with a plan formulated.

As Thanea begins heading back up the hill to the bowl shaped valley's entrance, Allisa ushers the party to retreat, stating she will watch their rear. Saoirse initially won't leave her, but both Allisa and [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) are stern with her, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) explaining that she'll keep an eye on Allisa. Thanea returns to Saoirse, grabbing her arm and dragging her as Saoirse looks back at Allisa.

Allisa lingers for a moment, pointing her staff towards the crater. As she casts Detect Magic, the amethyst gem at the end of her staff faintly glows purple for a moment, which [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Saoirse catch, watching as she moves the staff to her chest before turning and running after the party. Allisa didn't detect any magic nearby. Allisa keeps an eye on the party's rear as they retreat, periodically turning around, her staff and shield always at the ready.

As the party retreats, Saoirse and Thanea discuss the possibility that they may be ambushed or found by [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) while sleeping. Thanea suggests that they will hopefully have the breathing space to formulate a plan once they return to the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) beyond the crest of the hill.

## A Wolf Crests the Hill

As [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) gets close to the crest of the hill, she hears the sound of movement coming from beyond it, the sound of multiple heavy footfalls. Thanea stops and cautions the party, everyone stopping to figure out what's going on.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) spots a nearby large rock and rushes over to it, urging someone else who isn't too big to follow her. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) follows. The pair tuck in and hide behind the rock. When Saoirse notices that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is sticking out from its side, she grabs hold of her, pulling her further along.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> This doesn't mean I like you by the way.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) moves to the front with Thanea, preparing for combat from in front. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) scans the area for her own place to hide, finding only a petrified tree some distance along the hillside.

The front line hears the sound of a single four legged creature running quickly towards the crest of the hill, about to arrive any moment. Torbra takes off running towards the tree she sees, hopping up a rocky ledge as she goes, intent on climbing the tree when she gets there. Thanea turns around and begins running towards the rock that Saoirse and [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) are hidden behind. Allisa casts Shield of Faith on Thanea as she moves, Allisa not even looking as she points the staff at Thanea.

In this moment a large white wolf ([Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md), Wild Shaped into a dire wolf) crests the hill at a full dash. It skids to a stop and growls at the party before it.

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) steps forward and casts Burning Hands from her staff, setting much of the wolf's fur on fire. She retreats back to [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md), placing herself in front of her. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) emerges from behind the large rock, rushing up to the wolf and stabbing it with her rapier. As the wolf recoils from the blast of fire, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) misses with both her rapier and dagger, nipping her dagger arm as it sails right past its mouth.

The wolf bites at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s shoulder, pushing her to the ground with ease. Almost immediately it lets go and backs up, placing a bit of distance between it and [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) as [Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md) realises who he is again after seeing [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) military badge.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) charges to the wolf from her position at the back of the party, swinging her halberd as she arrives. She slices it cleanly from its left side to the top of its left shoulder, blood immediately cascading down through its white fur. The wolf yelps and whimpers, snarling at Torbra for a moment before stopping, its mouth closing as it licks its chops. Torbra pushes her advantage, swinging twice more using Action Surge, but is able to connect with either as the wolf's demeanour takes the commitment out of Torbra, allowing the wolf to dodge her strikes.

Thanea tries to throw a Fire Bolt at the wolf's head but misses by the tiniest of margins. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) emerges from behind the large rock, switching which side of the party's rear she is at. She casts Hex on the wolf, placing a curse on it that hinders its strength.

Allisa casts Sacred Flame on the wolf, a radiant sunbeam shining down upon the wolf directly, dealing plenty of damage to it.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is confused by how docile the wolf has become, noting that the wolf relented once it had pushed her to the ground. She moves up to the wolf and offers it a ration from her bag, unwrapping it and holding it at arm's length, wary that it will take the change to bite her hand.

The wolf whimpers slightly, drops prone and shuffles backwards slightly, its submissiveness now fully on show, Elrick trying to convince the party not to kill him. Torbra activates her Stone Rune, the wolf seizing up, unable to move.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## The Placid Wolf

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) begins wrapping her length of rope around the wolf to subdue it. As she begins, the wolf resists her stone rune and begins snarling, trying to get its teeth to the rope that runs across its chest. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) approaches it again with the ration she is holding, the wolf sniffing it momentarily. Torbra sees [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) doing this and stops tying the rope but holds it taut. The wolf bites off two thirds of the ration bar in one go, mashing it clumsily between its teeth, watching [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) intently the entire time.

Now fed, the wolf turns its head to Torbra and lets out a low growl, prompting her to relent with the ropes, dropping them completely. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) make their way closer, trying to understand the apparent friendliness of this large wolf.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> I always wanted a pet. Maybe it's a sign?

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> It's a big pet.

Saoirse checks the wolf for wounds, only able to find those just inflicted by the party, though she does find small missing areas of fur on its right side. She writes it off as battle scars worn with age, unable to see the scarred blade marks under the fur that were caused by [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md).

Torbra pulls a ration of her own out of her bag, offering it to the wolf. It sniffs it momentarily before clasping it with its teeth gently. When Torbra realises what it's doing she lets go of the ration slowly. The wolf now has hold of the ration in its mouth, beginning to stand back up immediately.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) tentatively makes her way back over to the party, having been watching the wolf intently from a distance the entire time. She suggests that the wolf isn't completely wild, Allisa acknowledging her as she gives the wolf space to stand up. The wolf places its head directly over Saoirse, letting out a harmless low growl before walking back to the crest of the hill.

Torbra and Saoirse follow it readily, caught off guard by how quickly a wolf of its size can move, even when it's not running. Saoirse voices that the current situation is weird.

## Following the Wolf

As the party crests the hill, they return to a view down into the northern extent of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) valley. The wolf is a short distance away to their right, making its way northeast. Behind it is a section of trees and denser foliage that isn't typical of the valley floor, but exists here where the [Foss Peaks](../places/topography/mountains/foss-peaks.md) intersect the north of the valley, forming a buffer zone.

The wolf was walking in this direction but as the party crests the hill it turns around and sits, waiting expectantly for them to follow. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) begin walking over to it. As [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) arrives to its side, the wolf continues walking in the direction of the trees further down the hill.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> It could either be a trap, or something really cool.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Yes, a creature that we almost murdered is leading us into a trap now.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> You never know!

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> I'm following the damned thing.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) leads on, Saoirse following closely behind, while the rest of the valley follow thereafter. The blood from Torbra's deep cutting halberd swing can be seen across its entire left shoulder now, droplets hitting the grass below as it goes. The wolf isn't perturbed by its wound, [Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md) intent on leading the party.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) keeps an eye on the party's rear. She warns everyone to keep on their guard, suggesting that despite them having left [Upper Tresenda](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/upper-tresenda.md), [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) could attack at any moment. She also cautions against the wolf, suggesting that this could be just as dangerous.

Saoirse wonders aloud about the wolf, thinking about [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s ability to Wild Shape into other creatures, suggesting that the wolf could be a person. Both her and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) recall fighting [Tarpher Forestcaller](../characters/tarpher-forestcaller.md) in [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md), a druid who turned into a dire wolf in the arena. Saoirse gets excited at the prospect of the wolf being one of the members of the other [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad in the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). Torbra wonders how it could remain a wolf for so long if that were the case.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> I don't know. I barely know how to use my magic, let alone how other magic works. I don't know, but it clearly wants us to follow it, so let's see.

## The Wounded Tabaxi

The party continues following the wolf as it moves at the party's pace, periodically turning to keep an eye on everyone. For the next hour they follow it down the edge of the valley, eventually reaching a low lying area that is overshadowed by steep cliffs belonging to the [Foss Peaks](../places/topography/mountains/foss-peaks.md), and twenty or so trees that create a miniature forested area. A smaller cliff tier no higher than 10 ft becomes apparent ahead, with dense foliage on top of it that forms the base of the steeper cliffs.

The wolf heads over to the shorter cliff, finding a spot where the rock indents, forming a slight inset area that is less exposed to the elements. The wolf places its head into the recess for a moment, the party losing sight of it as it checks on [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md). When the wolf pulls its head out and steps to one side, [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) rounds the corner to see what is inside.

She spots [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md), slumped against the rocks at the back of the recess, head down and unmoving. Before him lies the contents of his backpack, ripped open and strewn everywhere by the wolf, [Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md)'s desperate attempts to keep his [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) alive. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) spots that the entire left side of his face is covered in blood.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), what are you seeing?

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Well, you may have been right about this dog after all. It doesn't seem to be wild, because we may have just found its owner.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) asks if they are alive, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) judging that it doesn't look like it, but suggests taking a look for themself, assuming the wolf allows it. Saoirse asks if Thanea has a medicine kit, but Thanea doesn't have the necessary supplies to make something useful. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) suggests pulling the body out so that they can get a better look.

Torbra and Thanea poke their heads into the recess to see the tabaxi for themselves while the wolf paces back and forth and [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) keeps her eyes glued to the treeline, still wary of other threats. The pair spot the contents of [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md)'s backpack, in particular: wet & soiled papers with wolf prints on them, a length of rope, and empty ration wrappers, all strewn about the place. They spot that Scratch is missing his left eye and ear, the upper left side of his face stripped down to the muscle. Where his left arm was is in a similar state.

Allisa, still keeping watch, asks if the tabaxi is dead or alive. Torbra states confidently that they categorically aren't alive. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Torbra both lift Scratch in order to pull him out of the recess. Torbra takes the legs, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) taking the shoulders. Her hands quickly get slick with blood, causing her to momentarily drop Scratch, causing the wolf to bark loudly and bare its teeth as it lowers its head, clearly unhappy with the mistreatment of its friend. The pair lay Scratch down in the grass, allowing everyone a clear view of the destruction of his body's top left, including hanging tendon & nerve fibres where his left arm used to be.

Allisa comes over, kneeling next to Scratch. She takes her [Citrine Eye Necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md) off from around her neck and presses the gemstone to Scratch's chest, placing both of her hands over it, one on top of the other. She closes her eyes and lets her magical energy reach out to Scratch, allowing her to detect signs of life within him.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> He's not dead...

In response she casts Prayer of Healing, causing the citrine gemstone to glow with radiant light, providing healing. His chest undulates for a moment before a small amount of sick emerges from his mouth. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) takes pity on Scratch, voicing her uneasiness with his state:

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Isn't this some sort of torture at this point?

The wolf circles round to the recess, picking up Torbra's ration from the floor before returning to [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md), placing it at the top of his chest after gently pushing Allisa to one side. It rests its head on Scratch's belly, wanting to remain close to him.

## Tending to Wounds

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) grabs her waterskin and props [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md)'s head up, trying to slowly get him to drink. The water remains in his mouth, so she massages his throat to allow him to swallow. The process is slow.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) searches the recess for signs of who this tabaxi might be. She finds a shortsword and an [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) badge amongst the detritus, recognising it as matching Torbra's military badge. She states her belief that they've discovered the remains of the other [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad that came through here, handing the badge to Torbra. Saoirse turns to the wolf, speaking to it:

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Are you an actual wolf, or... a party member?

Looking at the wolf leaning on Scratch's belly as she talks, she sees it looking down at the ground, but it seems to ignore her (it is deaf and does not hear her).

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) tries to tends to the wolf's wounds but is unsure what to do with Torbra's halberd slice. As she places her hands on the wolf she fails to notice it jumping slightly, not hearing her coming. She finds the scars left by [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) blade arms, noting that they are blade shaped, but unsure of their origin or how long it has been since the wounds healed.

Saoirse grabs a waterskin that she saw amongst Scratch's backpack contents, checking what's inside. She finds it corked and full of water, passing it to Torbra to help her tend to him. She then pulls out her own waterskin which is full of grain alcohol from [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) in [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md), getting ready to try and disinfect some of the more severe wounds.

Checking the wounds more closely, Saoirse spots maggots where Scratch's arm ends just below the shoulder. As she gets ready to pour on the areas most likely to be infected, [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) explains that maggots only eat dead flesh, so she would be better off targeting other areas, but is ultimately dismissive of Scratch, advising Saoirse to do whatever she feels is best for this outsider.

While Torbra is supporting Scratch's head, Saoirse places a found piece of wood in his mouth before pouring the alcohol from her waterskin across the top of his head, the liquid cascading down the side of his face and pooling in his eye socket. Scratch's neck muscles tense as she continues, directing the liquid higher on his head, the alcohol pouring into the hole where his left ear used to be.

Scratch begins to grunt in severe pain from the sting of the alcohol, his entire body tensing up as he lies still with his eyes closed, letting out several groans as he bites down hard on the wood in his mouth. While this is happening [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) attempts to pet the wolf reassuringly, but as Scratch grunts, it leaps up, circles round to his head to get a better view, before returning to Scratch's belly and laying back down.

Saoirse asks if anyone has dressing, Torbra offering old robes from her backpack. Allisa offers her help, cautioning that this will be the last time she can do this. She returns to her knees and drops her equipment before removing the glove on her right hand. The party observe as her hand faintly glows with radiant energy, considerably less severe than when she took her helmet off. She hovers her hand over Scratch's head wounds while clasping at her necklace with her other hand. She casts Prayer of Healing through her necklace, causing it to glow. She touches all five fingertips to the wounds on Scratch's head, causing his flesh to scab over and begin to heal in a pattern that expands from the points she is touching, months of healing happening in mere seconds. By the time the spell's effect ends, the exposed flesh of his head is sealed with leathery healing scab.

## Seeking Medical Attention

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> If we don't get this one more help soon, he won't make it. You poor boy.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) agrees, suggesting that [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) put their [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission ([Search for a Meteorite in Tresenda Pass](../storylines/search-for-a-meteorite-in-tresenda-pass.md)) on hold until they can get [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) to safety, calling this an emergency. They know where the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) is and can come back for it. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) reckons that they already have good evidence for [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md). [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) goes one step further, suggesting that bringing a wounded [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) back home will go a long way to proving that their time was well spent. She also ponders their exact mission brief, suggesting that retrieving the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) isn't a hard requirement - information may be enough.

The party consider what evidence they have, noting the pouch of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) in [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s possession and the exact location of the crater and [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md).

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) cautions that if the party return to civilisation, this will be goodbye. Saoirse hopes it isn't forever, Allisa quick to assure them that it will be temporary. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) points out that Allisa can use Sending to keep in touch.

Saoirse suggests that with a rest, both her and Thanea can use their healing magic to stabilise Scratch before the party mount an effort to retrieve the [Tresenda meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md). She wonders if Allisa would have time to do both, Allisa happy to assist in the morning after resting.

Saoirse and Thanea agree that a rest is needed regardless. After getting the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) they can head south to [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md) or [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md) they can get medical help for Scratch while sending a letter or horse messenger to [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) to inform her of what's occurred.

Thanea cautions that with snows on the way due to it being late autumn, they might not get a chance to return to [Upper Tresenda](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/upper-tresenda.md) until the spring, so they should try to get the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) while they're here, then go south to the nearest settlement. Allisa informs Thanea that they'd be going in the wrong direction for the nearest settlement, alluding to [Filisur](../places/settlements/villages/filisur.md) to the north. Thanea consults her map, realising that [Filisur](../places/settlements/villages/filisur.md) is at most two days away from here.

Saoirse cautions against going to [Filisur](../places/settlements/villages/filisur.md), not sure if anyone there will be able to provide medical attention. Thanea would be surprised if a settlement wouldn't have someone with medical experience. Allisa suggests that the three [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) should be able to close Scratch's wounds, so what he needs most is a warm bed and someone to take care of him. The pair agree with the sentiment.

Saoirse hints that she may have a strategy for retrieving the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), but will elaborate once they are comfortable.

The party decides to camp out here before making their next move. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) offers to cast Tiny Hut, but warns that the large wolf will need to back off for 10 minutes (ritual cast) in order for her to project it, and then they won't be able to enter, which may cause it distress.

Thanea approaches the wolf with the intent of stroking it and trying to persuade it to move out of the way. As she places her hand on it, still resting on Scratch's chest, she feels it tense up as it realises she is there, before it turns its head towards her, its giant form foreboding. While she talks to it, it places its head back down on Scratch's belly.
