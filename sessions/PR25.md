## Saoirse Deva Dream 2

Saoirse relives events from the arena that transpired while she was unconscious. Occasionally the arena and opponents are replaced with the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) and [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md). During these moments the lighting is dark and much blood can be seen.

### [Mortar Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md)

- Wakes up on arena edge.
- What she sees:
  - [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) slices at Aisling with bestial claws, knocking her unconscious.
  - Giant Torbra and Reozin attacking each other. Torbra touches rune on her armour. Reozin stops moving.
  - Arrow appears from behind the wall, hitting Torbra hard.
  - Thanea runs behind wall. Flashes of fire illuminate the arena.
- [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) appears from behind Saoirse, offering his hand.
  - If she accepts, fade to white.

### [Gloom Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md)

- Wakes up between arena edge and wall.
- What she sees:
  - Ophelia unconscious near her.
  - Torbra unconscious, [Brian](../characters/brian.md) wandering nearby.
  - [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) as a black bear mauling Moss who falls unconscious on a moving bed of vermin.
  - Norma and her bestial spirit charging toward [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).
- Thanea with Radiant Soul active swoops down from the sky, landing effortlessly next to Saoirse. She offers Saoirse her hand.
  - If she accepts, both immediately wake up at 3am.
