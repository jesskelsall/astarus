## After the Match

Following [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) against [Gloom squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md), the party exits the arena. They take some time to tend to their wounds.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) finds an opportunity to slip away to a more secluded area behind [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md). Only [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) notices her do this, but doesn't act on it. Thanea looks for an exit from the arena's compound but reaches a dead end. She slumps against the wall, beginning to cry as the gravity of her Radiant Soul ability sinks in.

*[Short rest]*

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks the party if she could get some money for better armour ahead of the tournament final. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) gives her 40 gp, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) gives her 10 gp. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) heads off on her own, spending her newly acquired 50 gp on a set of scale mail. She tries to blag a discount but is unable to, the blacksmith remarking that she is the second person in two days to claim to be participating in the tournament - Saoirse being the other.

## At [Geor's Door](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/geors-door.md)

Saoirse wants to go grab a beer after a hard fought battle. Torbra happily tags along. They both find their way back to [Geor's Door](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/geors-door.md). Once inside they notice a table where people are playing [Iron Stomach](../mechanics/roleplay/games/iron-stomach.md), as well as a table further back hosting games of [Twenties](../mechanics/roleplay/games/twenties.md).

Torbra approaches the [Iron Stomach](../mechanics/roleplay/games/iron-stomach.md) table as the dwarven organiser is seeking two more competitors to play. Saoirse follows her over, holding her halberd for her. She sits down and awaits her challenger. The announcer calls her the "Grey Giant", thrilled by the presence of a tournament competitor. [Cila Green](../characters/cila-green.md) emerges from the crowd, sitting across from Torbra and cracking her knuckles. Once the rules are explained, Torbra places 1 gp on the table as a wager. Cila wordlessly expresses her excitement, raising the bet to 5 gp. Torbra matches.

The game begins with Torbra going first. She starts strong, drinking the strongest drink available at any given time. Cila does the same, keen to rise to her challenge. Cila starts to make light of the game, burping proudly after one of her drinks. After one drink too many she puts her glass down before slumping to the floor unconscious. Torbra, now drunk, wins! She pockets 5 gp of profit. Saoirse begins chanting her name while Torbra roars in victory.

Saoirse is then keen to play herself. The announcer, once again thrilled at the sight of another competitor, introduces her as "Finger Blaster". Saoirse immediately places 5 gp on the table. A male goliath emerges from the crowd, sitting opposite from her. He slams his small coin pouch on the table before counting out 5 gp, made primarily of silver and copper coins, slowly counting the exact amount out. As the game starts, Saoirse also goes big first, the goliath following her pattern.

As the game develops, Saoirse switches it up, taking the softest drink on the table as a strategic move, drawing jeers from the crowd. The goliath continues knocking back drinks, emotionless throughout. Saoirse is soon drunk, fighting an uphill battle. She stifles some sick, taking a point of exhaustion in the process. The goliath almost immediately starts to show similar issues, letting a small amount of vomit after one drink, then spraying vomit across the table and into his cup on the next drink. Both press on, Saoirse feeling empowered to win while booing on the goliath. He takes his final drink, looking back at Saoirse booing. The motion causes him to empty his stomach onto the floor next to him, after which he gets up and walks off, blending back into the crowd. Saoirse wins, pocketing 5 gp of profit.

Saoirse is amazed at her victory, sharing her victory with Torbra. The pair endeavour to head back to the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md), drunk early in the evening.

## Thanea on the Streets

Meanwhile Thanea is still hiding behind [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md). She attempts to reach out to [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) for comfort or answers, but there is no response.

She heads out into the streets of [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md), amongst the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festivities. Hungry, she heads over to a food vendor, spending 2 sp.

While waiting in line her shoulder is tapped by an older male child. When she turns around she sees the boy, wide-eyed, who remarks in disbelief:

*Commoner:*

> It's the angel. It's the angel!

Thanea gets uncomfortable with the situation, choosing to leave the crowded area in case more people realise who she is. As she leaves she catches various people staring - some grinning, others staring in disbelief at the mere sight of her. Out of sight of others, she finds a quiet spot to sit and eat, wondering if she will be cast out due to her wings, much like she was from Bootle.

## Sleeping Arrangements

Eventually the party make their way back to the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md), preparing to sleep for the night. With both Saoirse and Torbra smelling of alcohol, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) insists that they share a room together.

| Room 1 | Room 2 |
| --- | --- |
| [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) |

Saoirse is annoyed by [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s remark, the alcohol bolstering her confidence. She chastises her for not drinking herself, and declares that the forest smells of poo. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) shuts her in her room, causing her to get more irate. She brags about winning a drinking game against a goliath.

Before Saoirse collapses to sleep, she turns to Torbra and remarks:

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*

> I'll never forget this.

## Saoirse Deva Dream 2

During the night Saoirse begins dreaming.

She feels uncomfortably warm, like her skin is on fire. She opens her eyes, finding herself lying on her side on the arena floor in [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md). She watches as in slight slow motion the events of [Mortar Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) vs [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) play out. The events transpiring are those that took place while she was unconscious mid-fight.

Saoirse is unable to move, frozen in place but able to look with her eyes. As her skin continues to burn from [Diarmuid Kavanagh](../characters/diarmuid-kavanagh.md)'s fire that knocked her out, the burning subsides, replaced by a pleasant cooling sensation. The gravel around her begins to be illuminated with white-yellow light as the glowing hand of [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) reaches down into her view, offering it to her. She looks up at him but struggles to fight against his radiant light.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*

> Who the fuck are you?

As she asks this, she grabs his offered hand. The moment she does, the light grows more intense, blinding her.

Once again she finds herself lying on the arena floor, this time with her head throbbing from blunt force trauma from [Norma Collarbone](../characters/norma-collarbone.md)'s Skipping Stone impact. The events of [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) vs [Gloom Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md) are now playing out in a similar level of slow-motion.

At one point in this sequence, the scenery is replaced with that of [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), and each member of [Gloom Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md) is replaced with a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), while the events of the arena continue to play in this guise. The cave itself is bathed in purple light. After a brief moment of this, the scene snaps back to the arena.

The gravel once again is illuminated by white-yellow light. As Saoirse looks up she sees [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) gliding down towards her with her Radiant Soul wings. When she lands, the wings envelop Saoirse on the ground. Thanea's glowing eyes stare back at Saoirse, a knowing smile breaking out on her face as she offers her hand.

As Saoirse reaches for and touches her hand, both [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) wake up in the middle of the night.

## Midnight Revelations

Saoirse gets out of bed, unsure of what happened. She storms out of her room and makes her way along the corridor to a wash room at its end. Thanea, now awake, hears someone get up. Opening the door she sees Saoirse taking off with purpose. She follows her, but Saoirse doesn't react.

Saoirse arrives at the wash room, jumping into a shower stall and running the water before slumping to the ground against the wall, the water washing over her. When Thanea arrives she asks if she's okay.

While sobbing, Saoirse explains that she has been having dreams since the party fought the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md). Thanea is startled by this, asking for more details about the dreams, mentally wondering if there are similarities with her own dreams. Saoirse recants her original dream, describing the presence of [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md), a glowing figure with wings, as well as [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) (mentioned by first name to Thanea). She also recants the dream she just woke up from, describing [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) again.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*

> Are you serious?

Thanea is taken aback by what Saoirse is telling her. She tells Saoirse that she has had similar dreams, of a bright being with wings ([Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) in her case). She casually mentions the moment that her Radiant Soul wings appeared in the arena. This causes Saoirse to do a double-take, not knowing this due to her being unconscious the entire time Thanea's wings were out. Thanea tells her that it felt like a near death experience to her and that the wings materialised subconsciously, saving her.

When Thanea questions Saoirse on who Effie is, Saoirse brushes it off, describing her as "just a friend" who she's not spoken to in a while, and who she is not currently on good terms with. She doesn't think the party would like her, putting herself down in the process and explaining that Effie abandoned her. Thanea reassures Saoirse that she likes her.

Saoirse still can't believe that Thanea has wings. She is grateful for her help saving her in the arena, especially as she was then able to "kick ass" afterwards. Thanea is confused as Saoirse believes the events of her dream to be truthful, even though they're only metaphorical.

Thanea in turn explains that she had a dream where [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) and her flew together and helped save a city ([Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md)). She asks Saoirse if she has wings.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*

> Do you think I could have wings? I'm literally a nobody. I mean I'm an alcoholic, I'm sure alcoholics dream weird shit.

Saoirse remarks about how cool it would be to have wings. She asks Thanea if she knew she had wings. Thanea explains that when she had the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) dream she felt that something was different about her. She feels that typically when she feels that something is different about herself it is accompanied by painful moments or memories. Saoirse is sorry to hear that.

Thanea is surprised that nobody has really reacted negatively to her wings yet, though she does remark on the amount of people who have been staring at her, wondering why exactly. Saoirse doesn't find it hard to understand, telling Thanea that anyone would stare at an angel, someone who is impressive. Thanea just doesn't want to be hated. Saoirse reassures her by saying that they'd have to fight through Saoirse to get to her. Thanea is clearly bothered by her new found fame.

Saoirse is very supportive, telling Thanea that her wings are incredible, and that if she is able to manifest them in the final tomorrow, that would be useful.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*

> And who knows, maybe one day I'll actually sprout wings, and then you won't be alone any more.

Thanea tells Saoirse that their dreams are eerily similar and that she woke up at the same time Saoirse did. Saoirse didn't realise. The pair find it strange and beyond coincidence. Thanea doesn't feel like she's been in control of anything for a long time now. Saoirse believes that feeling won't last much longer due to her abilities. Thanea hopes so as she's tired of running away.

Saoirse wants to towel off and go back to bed, so Thanea leaves so she can sleep herself. Before she goes, Thanea suggests that the pair tell each other about their dreams so they can help each other figure out who they are.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*

> Yeah, let's be fucked up together!

Thanea leaves Saoirse in the wash room.

## Effie's Gift

While Saoirse is towelling herself off, the oil lantern lighting the room goes out. A familiar voice fills the room. [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) tells Saoirse that she hasn't abandoned her. Saoirse retorts that Effie wasn't there when she needed her, but Effie is dismissive, only caring that she's here now.

When Saoirse makes a joke about Effie drying her back for her, Effie cackles. The room goes completely black. Saoirse feels something tugging at her back before the lantern comes back on. There is a weight to her back that is unfamiliar. She turns, catching a glimpse of her Necrotic Shroud wings for the first time. They are black, spectral, and appear to float delicately above her back. She is curious, touching one of her wings. This sends shivers down her spine as she feels the souls of the dead crying out in terror. The feeling ends as soon as she takes her hands from her wings.

*[Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md):*

> A gift. You wanted wings, right?

Saoirse tries flapping her wings and jumping a bit. It becomes clear that while she can move them, they can't carry her weight, making flight with them impossible. Saoirse is pissed at Effie because of this, but Effie believes that these will be more useful. Saoirse doesn't pass up a free gift.

Saoirse then asks Effie where she's been. Effie is dismissive, explaining that she has other friends. Saoirse reminds her that Effie was her only friend when she was still living at home. Effie points out that Saoirse seems to have all the friends she needs now, but Saoirse dismisses this, not feeling the party sans Thanea are friend material. With this, Effie excuses herself, remarking that she'll "be in touch".

Saoirse then tries going back to bed. Her wings get caught on the door. As she imagines getting rid of them, they melt away into nothingness.

*[[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) unlocks her Fallen [Aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) abilities]*

*[Long rest]*

## [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md)'s Final Day

At the beginning of the day [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) buys drawing supplies so she can practice her Frost Rune. She buys a pot of ink, ink pen, and 10 sheets of paper, totalling 12 gp 2 cp. She spends some time back at her room practising, succeeding in learning how to use the rune on her 6th sheet of paper.

*[[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) unlocks the ability to create the Frost Rune at will]*

The party agrees to head out onto the streets of [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) and enjoy the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival before the [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) final at sundown. Saoirse wishes to keep to herself but [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) coerces into some team bonding with the offer of buying her a drink. They peruse the streets, seeing all of the activities on offer.

The party find that they are recognised by many, a consequence of their high profile participation in the tournament.

| Character | Nickname | Commoner Reactions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | Finger Blaster | Giving her one or more middle fingers in glee. |
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | The Angel / Angel of [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) | Disbelief and reverence. Some considering her a blessing or good omen for the festival. |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | Grey Giant | One tired joke about appearing shorter in person compared to her large arena appearance. |
| [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) | The Blue Firbolg | Mostly reactions from town crier news about the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) trial for [the firbolg controversy](../storylines/ended/the-firbolg-controversy.md). |

## [Test of Strength](../mechanics/roleplay/games/test-of-strength.md)

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) wants to give the [Test of Strength](../mechanics/roleplay/games/test-of-strength.md) a try. The pale coloured tiefling running the game explains the rules and that the game costs 1 pp to play, though that allows two people to play. He also explains that lifting 500 lb wins 1 pp and beating the record wins whatever is in his coin purse.

Thanea gives [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) 10 gp to play with. The tiefling explains that an actual platinum coin is needed. Eventually [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) finds someone in the crowd who can exchange the money. With that, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Torbra play.

| Character | Sandbags | Result |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) | 16 | 1 pp. |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | 11 | No prize. |

The tiefling offers another round. On the second try both [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Torbra manage to lift the exact same amount of sandbags. Once again [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is given 1 pp back. The tiefling calls it a draw, keen to have someone else try. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) gives the 1 pp coin back to Thanea.

## [Three Legged Race](../mechanics/roleplay/games/three-legged-race.md)

Saoirse asks the orc running the event how much it costs to enter. He explains that the game is just for fun - no wager. Saoirse convinces Thanea to get roped to her. When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks if her and Torbra can race Saoirse and Thanea, the orc is accommodating, particularly as an entire [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad competing in the tournament is playing his festival game.

| Pair 1 | Pair 2 |
| --- | --- |
| [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) |
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) |

Both pairs get off to shaky starts, falling over several times before finding their rhythm. Torbra and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) pull a slight lead before Saoirse and Thanea also start making good headway, but by then it's too late as [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Torbra cross the finish line first, winning the game.

Saoirse demands a rematch, but as she looks back she sees the orc already setting up the next four competitors.

## Late Afternoon

With the day winding down and the tournament final closing in, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) suggests the group go back to [Geor's Door](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/geors-door.md) and enjoy a few relaxed drinks to catch a breather before the match. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) buys Saoirse the promised drink for 2 sp. Saoirse expresses to the party a hope that she'll be more useful this time, having gone down quickly in the last two matches.

Not long later Saoirse finds a quiet moment to herself. Here she mixes her remaining portion of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) with some water, ingesting it. Soon the effects of the powder have hit her, causing her perception of the world around her to become vividly coloured and profoundly confusing.

*[[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is now under the effect of the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md).]*

Upon her return to the party she tries to hide how she feels, keeping a low profile. Nobody suspects anything is awry.

Eventually the party make their way to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), eagerly awaiting the [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) final against [Komodo Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md).
