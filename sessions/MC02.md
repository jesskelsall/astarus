## Arriving in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md)

After two days on the road from [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md), [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) arrive in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) at the end of the second day, right as night begins to fall. Their journey has been quiet and uneventful, with little conversation between the pair as Vētrall contemplates the letter they received from [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md).

The pair soon find the [Big Magpie Pub](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/big-magpie-pub.md) and take separate rooms for the night. In the morning they eat breakfast before tackling the day head.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## Retrieving Geen's Treasure

Once outside, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) tells [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) that it is time for him to learn how to be a good member of [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md). They order him to go off into the city and look for adventuring work for the pair.

Valan is furious, shouting back at Vētrall. He points out the hypocrisy of claiming to be training someone before sending them to complete a task alone. Vētrall counters that this is their teaching style and he should just do as he is told. Valan is annoyed but ultimately complies. Vētrall suggests looking for a noticeboard or similar that is soliciting adventurers.

This heated conversation out in the street catches the ears of [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) who are waiting in [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md) for armed adventurer types entering the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md). They see the pair down the next street, following Vētrall with their eyes.

Vētrall turns the street corner, finding the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) that they were looking for. They enter the front of the building, seen by Kera and Marik.

On entering they are greeted with the entryway and the iron bars separating it from the square interior beyond. Two [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md) guards are stationed at the partition and its door, one on each side. As Vētrall approaches they wish them good morning. Vētrall begins to explain that they are here to open a lockbox. The guard asks for their key.

Vētrall presents the ornate key ([MC01F-I-3](../cards/MC01F-I-3.md)). The guard looks at the ornate head for a moment before passing the key back, informing Vētrall that they should head to the third floor, before removing a ring of keys from their belt and opening the iron bar door.

Vētrall enters the building proper. Spotting the staircase in its centre they head over and begin ascending. As they go they notice the [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md) stationed on each floor, looking over the railings around the edge of the central space.

On the third floor Vētrall is able to find the row of metal lockers that contains the locker they are looking for: `FV-1286`.

*[Everyone but [Rin](../../players/rin.md) leaves the table]*

Vētrall opens the locker, finding that it only contains a small chest ([MC02-I-1](../cards/MC02-I-1.md)). They place the chest into their backpack before poking their head into the locker, looking for anything hidden inside. When they find nothing, they lock the locker.

*[Everyone returns to the table]*

Vētrall makes their way back downstairs to the entrance. They find the door in the metal bar partition locked, but as they approach the guard on the inside unlocks the door for them without prompt, wishing them a good day as they [pas](../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md)s through to leave.

Meanwhile [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) wanders the nearby streets looking for work. He notices that most of the people on the streets are either traders or middle class families going out for the day. He finds a noticeboard but finds it devoid of work, only containing trade prices, marriage declarations, and a torn poster regarding a missing dog - the key information missing. He doubles back to check down another street.

## A Commotion Outside

While [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) was inside the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md), [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) put their pre-agreed plan into motion. The pair set up in the street directly outside of the building.

As Vētrall emerges, Kera runs up to Marik at full speed, skilfully swiping her conspicuously placed coin purse from her belt, continuing to run along the street in the direction of [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md) and [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) they earmarked for their ambush. Marik shouts "stop, thief!" into the street, aiming to catch Vētrall's attention.

At this point Vētrall notices what is happening. They cast Blindness/Deafness on Kera, blinding him.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Vētrall runs over to Kera and swipes Marik's coin purse (full of copper coins only) without any resistance. Marik runs over to Vētrall and thanks them for the help, gaining their coin purse back. Around this time [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) rounds the corner, catching the tail end of the scene. He draws his longbow and trains it on Kera, resolving to loose an arrow if he tries to attack Vētrall.

## Guards Arrive

At this point the [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md) in [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md)'s bag, contained inside of the lead lined box, malfunctions. Vētrall fails to notice the whirring sound or arcane aura in this moment. It begins to project the memories that it contains into the street while it begins to form a pocket dimension by itself.

Three Chausain Guards appear - two from down the street, one from behind Valan, shouting as they go:

*Chausain Guard:*
> They're here, get them!

The guard closest to Valan accuses him of being a traitor, a serious accusation that surprises the entire party:

*Chausain Guard:*
> Traitor!

The guards rush into the fray, moving into combat positions. Vētrall tries to appeal to them, seeking a peaceful resolution, but the guards do not respond. When Valan shoots an arrow at the guard closest to him at point blank range, Vētrall realises that violence is necessary. Simultaneously the other guards begin attacking [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md), making it unclear who exactly is being targeted. Everyone begins defending themselves as the guards enter into melee combat with their spears.

## Chausain Revealed

The [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md) completes its pocket dimension, transporting the party into it seamlessly. Inside a full recreation of the Battle of Chausain begins. The entire party notice that the street immediately turns dark as if it were night.

Everyone but Vētrall sees more. They notice an unfamiliar starry sky with not one but two moons - a large white one three times the size of [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md)' moon ([Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md)) and a smaller yellow one that is partially transiting it. They are no longer standing on a street in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) but find themselves on the second wall of Chausain. Where the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) was is now an unobstructed view across the rooftops of the lower ring and the outer wall, while the other side of the street gives way to views of the inner circle. They see buildings rising above them, including the Tower of Chausain.

On the outer walls Chausain Guards can be seen taking positions, holding torches. Beyond the wall, thousands of soldiers can be seen standing in formation, periodic torches illuminating them just enough to get a sense of scale. Only Marik and Valan get a true sense of the amount of people present beyond the walls and their possible intentions as a siege army ready to strike.

From within the city a large curved horn plays a long low pitched note, signalling the start of battle. Outside of the walls the torches begin to bob in unison as the army marches on the outer wall. The beating of war drums can be heard between the shouting of the city guards who spring into action.

Further down the street turned city wall, more guards appear in both directions. Ahead of the party a Chausain Guard and Chausain Guard Defender appear, while behind them a Chausain Guard Defender and Chausain Guard Attacker appear from the next guard tower on the wall. While the party is confused by where they are and what is happening, the guards move in to strike.

Valan moves toward the party and attacks one of the defenders moving in from the front, landing good hits with his arrows. Vētrall casts Levitate, taking flight above the top of the wall, anticipating melee-heavy combat. Marik casts Entangle on the wall, catching two of the guards with the tendrils that manifest from the stonework, trapping them in place for a time. Kera begins to put her warhammer to good use, beating the guards rhythmically, whittling them down.

## The First Wall Falls

There is a large wood breaking sound as the outer gate of Chausain is breached by the attacking army. Soldiers flood into the lower ring as sword fighting can be heard en masse below.

At this moment a catapulted projectile that burns with a blue flame impacts the building next to where the party is fighting, sending debris hurtling down onto the wall. A large chunk hits Marik in the back, doing her a great injury.

As the blue flames illuminate the wall, another contingent of guards appear from behind the party: two more Chausain Guards, two more Chausain Guard Defenders, and a Chausain Guard Zealot.

*Chausain Guard Zealot:*
> Clear the wall!

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) decides to Wild Shape into a draft horse. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) hops on and begins swinging at the guards that have now surrounded the pair. As Marik gallops away to put some distance between the guards, several of them take jabs at her, knocking her out of her animal form. This throws Kera to the ground prone.

The guards waste no time exploiting the situation, piling on Kera who soon succumbs to her injuries and falls unconscious. The moment she does she simply disappears, much to the surprise and horror of the remaining party members. Marik defends herself with Produce Flame but soon succumbs to the same fate, blinking out of existence.

As the new wave of guards surge forward, the zealot advances. He cups his hand as if holding a large sphere in it, creating a ball of radiant energy in that space. He points it along the wall, causing it to stretch rapidly into a beam of radiant energy that hits [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) just below the neck. They tumble backwards, turning upside down and rapidly losing altitude while passing out. Before they hit the floor they vanish.

## One Final Glimpse

*[Everyone but [Viktorija](../../players/viktorija.md) leaves the table]*

[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) is the last party member standing. It is not long before he is surrounded and skewered by the guards who have no intention of taking prisoners.

In his final moments he notices strange phenomena up towards the Tower of Chausain. A large horizontal plane of purple arcane symbols can be seen intersecting the top floor of the tower. These symbols are geometric and purposeful and are extending slowly, the overall design of the magical pattern gaining in complexity as it does. The room that this pattern originates from begins to emit a dazzling purple light that floods out of every window.

Valan is knocked unconscious by the guards. As blackness greets him, he hears a middle aged authoritative voice that reverberates through him:

*[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md):*
> I'll be waiting for you.

*[Everyone returns to the table]*

## Waking in the Desert

The party begin to wake in the middle of the Kas'ran Desert. All four of them are unconscious face-down in the sand within a 20ft area, baking in the heat and sunlight of the middle of the day. Everyone but [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) stirs to life.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) looks around, assessing his surroundings. He is astounded to see a desert that stretches in all directions, with no other discernible features in sight. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) rouse and make similar deductions. Everyone is incredibly exhausted (level 4 exhaustion) and is struggling to focus.

Vētrall is wary of Kera, considering his role in stealing from Marik, but they realise that right now it is not important. Valan bemoans being in such a hostile environment for a drow raised in the snowy mountains. Vētrall puts their robe over their head, getting sand in their eyes and mouth in the process.

Kera notices Marik still lying motionless in the sand. He rushes to her and checks her for signs of life but fails to notice that she is alive but unconscious. He begins sobbing, lamenting her death.

Vētrall asks Kera who they are, encouraging brief introductions between the three. Kera introduces himself as *Calm* and Marik as *Tempest*. When Vētrall presses for information on what they were doing, Kera begins blubbering a half-remembered account of their mission and plan, ranting about a "metal man" ([The Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)), a "legend" ([Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md)) they were tasked with finding, and their plan to steal it from Vētrall. Kera fishes the letter ([MC01M-L-1](../letters/MC01M-L-1.md)) out of Marik's belongings and hands it to Vētrall, but they don't glean anything useful for it, leaving them more confused.

Vētrall asks who [Creek](../characters/creek.md) is and what they have on Kera and Marik. Kera describes them as a cat and then a tabaxi, but can't recall the specifics of their debt.

Valan begins to go a bit crazy, feeling trapped by the desert and hopelessly out of his element. He encourages the party to find a way out of the desert as soon as possible. Kera puts Marik over his back, moving his own shield over her head as a sun shade. Kera picks a random direction (north) and starts marching.

As they go, Vētrall checks Marik for signs of life. They find that Marik is breathing softly. Turning back to Kera, Vētrall offers a deal: don't ever steal from them again and I'll "bring your friend back to life". Kera goes wide eyed and accepts immediately, shocked that such a feat can be performed. He puts Marik down before Vētrall casts Healing Word on her.

Marik splutters back to consciousness. The party watch as she drinks in her perplexing surroundings and the unforgiving conditions of the desert. She asks the party in bewilderment what happened but an answer is not forthcoming.

Vētrall confronts Marik on her and Kera's nature, asking if they are thieves. Marik puts on her best act and claims otherwise, but Valan sees through it. Kera admits to Marik that he "told them everything", to which Marik tells him off for being so stupid, exasperated that they would have been wiser to keep that a secret. Marik remains tight lipped on their identities as [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) and the events of the day.

The party continues north for the rest of the day, stopping to rest as the sun sets. Everyone is incredibly tired, their water skins bone dry except for Kera who has been rationing his. They sleep for the night, during which the temperature plummets, suiting only Valan. By morning there is frost on everyone's eyelashes.

*[Everyone: no rest]*

On their second day the party trudges on but fails to find any signs of life amongst the dunes. After only an hour of travel their legs begin to give out and it is clear that they will get no further. Valan thinks a final prayer to [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) but receives no answer. Before long the heat and exhaustion gets to everyone and they slip into unconsciousness.

## Cared for by Dune

*[3 days later]*

The party begins to wake up in [Dune's House](../places/buildings/houses/dunes-house.md), lying on cots staring up at the ceiling. The sensation of shade is palpable. As everyone but [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) begins to stir, the voice of [Dune Under Sunset](../characters/dune-under-sunset.md) calmly advises them to rest and not exert themselves.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) ask where they are. Dune explains that they are in his house, but he provides a slightly more useful answer too: [Kuv'narash](../places/villages/kuvnarash.md). Nobody recognises the name nor where its name suggests the place is. Dune checks on Valan and tends to a bandage on his arm.

When Kera tries to get up, Dune advises otherwise. He gets up anyway and starts checking his belongings. Dune informs him that he has not touched any of their possessions, so they need not worry. Everyone begins to get up, Valan included.

Dune introduces himself. He tells the party that they were found off the usual trading route by a trade caravan, and are incredibly lucky to be alive. They were brought to him three days ago. He has been taking care of them since.

Vētrall realises that he has began to sunburn, his face turning purple from the desert sun. Dune grabs an aloe vera plant from his windowsill, cutting off a piece, cutting it open, and passing it to Vētrall, instructing them to smear the jelly on their face. Vētrall does, noticing an immediate pain relief.

*[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md):*
> I feel like a baked potato.

The party and Dune struggle to reconcile their places of origin. None of the party know where they are. When Dune says that [Kuv'narash](../places/villages/kuvnarash.md) is on the River Ume and surrounded by the Kas'ran Desert, several of the party recognise that deserts are south of the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md). Kera tries to talk about [Revenossa](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/revenossa.md) but Dune's ears prick up when Vētrall mentions the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md).

*[Dune Under Sunset](../characters/dune-under-sunset.md):*
> Ah, you're from the north.

Valan is keen to leave as soon as possible, asking about how they can return to the alliance. Dune tells them of a town on the coast to the west. The party is horrified to learn that the journey will take "less than a week" across the desert. Dune knows of someone ([Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md)) who may be able to help them with the journey, telling them as much. The party is thankful for the offer of help.

Valan asks Dune what they owe him for helping them. Dune informs them that his help comes with no cost. Valan cynically replies that there is always a cost, but Dune denies it sincerely. Valan manages to offend Dune by calling him a cat, prompting him to correct Valan.

## What's in the Box?

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) asks [Dune Under Sunset](../characters/dune-under-sunset.md) where a toilet might be. Dune directs them out of his house and down the street to an outhouse. They step out of [Dune's House](../places/buildings/houses/dunes-house.md) and into the streets of [Kuv'narash](../places/villages/kuvnarash.md), observing a narrow street between the adobe buildings, a tabaxi mother hanging her washing on a first floor balcony, and several children playing. Vētrall follows the instructions to a small wooden outhouse, heading inside and closing the door.

Once inside they open up the lead lined box ([MC02-I-1](../cards/MC02-I-1.md)). Inside they find the [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md) ([MC02-I-3](../cards/MC02-I-3.md)) and a sealed letter bearing the typical [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) golden seal ([MC02-L-1](../letters/MC02-L-1.md)).

They open the letter, reading both sides. They find it perplexing, with references to places vaguely familiar and people completely unknown. Vētrall takes a second before endeavouring to bin the box in the septic pit before realising that it is lined with metal, probably for a reason, and choosing to keep the sphere stored inside of it as intended.

They make their way back to [Dune's House](../places/buildings/houses/dunes-house.md).

## An Escort West

[Dune Under Sunset](../characters/dune-under-sunset.md) excuses himself from his house for a moment, returning after 15 minutes. He announces that he has found someone to help them west. [Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md) enters the room, her face wrapped so that only her eyes can be seen, and her tail tucked away in her brown robes.

She confirms with the party that they wish to head west to the next town, taking a moment to quiz what the party are doing all the way out here if they are in such a hurry to leave. The party give Zolné the best answer they can - they don't know how they got here, but they'd like to get home to the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md).

Zolné chooses to take up the cause. When the party ask what her price is, she tells them that there is no price. When pressed for an explanation she tells them that while she has seen many strange things on her travels, the party and their situation is intriguing enough that she feels inclined to help them out and see what is going first hand. The party find this a satisfactory enough answer.

Dune reveals that he was also able to find a map for them, revealing a rolled up parchment. He tells them that unlike his medicine, this won't be free. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) attempts to offer gold but Dune breaks the news that money isn't used in [Kuv'narash](../places/villages/kuvnarash.md). [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) offers to play a song for the village but Dune declines, wishing for something more tangible. When the party asks him to name his price, he suggests one of the Potions of Healing that the party possesses, implying that he has at least looked through their belongings. [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) offers his potion. Dune accepts and provides them a copy of the [Independent States of the Nil'Savnic Alliance](../maps/independent-states-of-the-nilsavnic-alliance.md) map.

The party study the map briefly. Zolné points to the River Ume on the bottom of the map, indicating their current location. Contrasting that with [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md), it dawns on the party just how far away from the city they have ended up, adding to their confusion and concern.

*[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md):*
> When are we setting off?

*[Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md):*
> When would you like to leave?

*[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md):*
> Now?

*[Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md):*
> Let us go.

Zolné grabs his glaive, wielding it as an extension of his arm, before heading straight out of the door, wasting no time. The party shuffles out of [Dune's House](../places/buildings/houses/dunes-house.md) without saying goodbye.

## Lions Over the Next Dune

As they exit the village to the west and emerge back onto the sand dunes, [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) finds himself curious and impressed by the tabaxi wielding an interesting and intimidating weapon. He asks about it. Zolné tells him that it was his fathers before him and his grandfather's before that, and that it can be used for sweeping slices at range.

When Kera asks Zolné what she uses her glaive to fight, Zolné points it forward to the next dune ahead, stopping as she does. The party notice three lions walking along it.

Zolné wastes no time. She pulls her headscarf off, revealing a yellow-gold mane down the back of her head as she sprints towards the lions now spoiling for a fight.

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md) charges towards the three lions, beginning to rage as she goes. The party are astounded by how fast she runs, particularly across the loose sand. She arrives at two of the lions and lets out a lion's roar of her own, frightening two of them. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) soon joins her, bringing her warhammer into position.

As [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) loose arrows toward the lions, missing all of their shots, one of the lions breaks rank and targets Valan behind the battle line. It bites him, wounding him easily. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) backs up their student, firing arrows and scoring some hits. This causes the lion to focus on them instead, buying Valan some time to reposition and open up on it with more arrows of his own.

Zolné gets to work carving up the lions with her glaive. She slices, spins the glaive's pole around her neck, then slices again, all in one seamless motion. This puts some serious cuts onto the two lions that Kera and her are battling. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) attempts to give backup by casting Thorn Whip and Produce Flame but misses multiple times.

Zolné rages a second time and calls upon her ancestors. Two blue translucent leonins appear alongside her wielding similar glaives, surrounding one of the lions and posturing to fight. This move funnels the lion toward Zolné, allowing Kera to swoop around it, attacking the other lion instead. He shatters its hind legs with his warhammer, leaving it crippled. The pair turn their attention to the last lion in front of them. Marik takes it out with a Thorn Whip that wraps around its neck, pulling the thorns tight into its neck and puncturing it in multiple places, killing it.

Vētrall is pounced on by the third lion which bites into her neck. They are able to get to their feet, casting Dissonant Whispers on the lion, wracking its mind with noises unfamiliar to it. As it runs away they react by casting Vicious Mockery, shattering its mind as its resolve fades:

*[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md):*
> Your face looks stupid!

Zolné calmly walks over to the last lion, skewering its head with the end of her glaive.

*[Initiative order ends]*

By now it is apparent to the party that [Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md) shares more in common physiologically with the lions than to tabaxis like [Dune Under Sunset](../characters/dune-under-sunset.md); they are a leonin. Vētrall asks how she feels about killing "her own kind", receiving a scoffing growl in disgust at the notion.

Zolné looks at the group, smirking.

*[Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md):*
> Well, you're not all as useless as I thought you'd be. That's good.

Zolné introduces herself with her full name, explaining that it feels right to do so now that she has seen their combat prowess. The rest of the party introduce themselves in kind.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) endeavours to pull a front leg from one of the lion corpses. He struggles in the endeavour, getting so frustrated that he starts shattering its shoulder with his warhammer. Zolné looks on, both horrified and morbidly entertained as Kera makes a fool of himself. Eventually he dismembers the lion leg, placing it on the back of his shield to cook in the desert sun.

Zolné dismissively tells Kera to just leave the corpses for the vultures. She ushers the party further west, wasting no time to continue their march across the dunes.
