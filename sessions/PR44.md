## Camping Overnight

With [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) confident that the view of the [Foss Peaks](../places/topography/mountains/foss-peaks.md) to the northeast matches what she saw in her dream ([Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)), [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) are confident that they're heading in the right direction. But with night falling, they decide to make camp and rest.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) casts Tiny Hut to create a magical dome to protect them from creatures and the late autumn cold. The party unpacks their sleeping gear and prepares to go to sleep, agreeing who will take watch:

| Character(s) | Shift |
| --- |:---:|
| [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)<br>[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | 4h |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | 4h |

At the beginning of [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Saoirse's watch, the night is uneventful except for a few bats and a squirrel going about their business. Tonight is a full moon, casting a faint amount of light across the valley plains. After a few hours, the pair hear packs of wolves howling, unable to pinpoint their direction and numbers.

With the pair awake alone, Saoirse uses the opportunity to talk with [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> I'm sorry if Thanea and I were quite harsh before. I'm sure you only meant well, but it really did scare us. We've just lost [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), so getting in situations like that is really scary, and I guess that made us lash out.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) shrugs Saoirse's apology off, no answer forthcoming. Saoirse expresses a lack of exposure to tieflings with the exception of [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md). She asks if tieflings are considered to be [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) telling her that they're not, but there is a stigma against tieflings, some considering her a bad omen. Saoirse praises [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s horns and general appearance, calling it cool. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) isn't bothered whether people think she's a demon.

Saoirse lists off the tieflings she's met: [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), Elysia, and [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md), explaining that her experiences of tieflings haven't been great, but she feels [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) will buck that trend. The pair bond for a moment over their difficult childhoods as outcasts with no friends.

As the pair are talking, the howling wolves slowly dissipate back into silence. Then very abruptly around 15-20 wolves nearby all begin howling loudly, catching the pair's attention. Saoirse says that it can't be a good sign, while [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) does her best howl impression.

Saoirse asks [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) if they're actually safe in the dome, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) responding with confidence, saying that nobody can see or get in. Saoirse is wary of a repeat of yesterday morning's pack of wolves.

The wolves eventually calm down, leading to a quiet night for the remainder of [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Saoirse's watch.

## Torbra's Watch

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) wakes [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) with a kick, passing the watch to her. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Saoirse fall asleep.

Several hours pass quietly, the comfortable temperature inside the Tiny Hut making Torbra sleepy, dulling her senses.

*[Torbra: long rest]*  
*[[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), Saoirse, Thanea: short rest]*

## A Hunter Approaches

Suddenly Torbra hears a thud sound within 5ft of her.

She turns to see a [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) on the edge of the magical dome, three sets of legs clearly visible with her darkvision. Her stomach drops as she slowly readies her halberd, just in case. She recognises the creature as being meteoric, but distinct from a [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md). As it scrapes one of its blade arms down the side of the dome, finding no purchase, the sound wakes [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md). The pair both see the hunter, getting a good look at its more angular and spiny shape.

Saoirse stifles a shriek, causing the hunter to look directly at where she is within the dome. It paces around slightly, its head locked on her position. Saoirse grabs hold of Thanea, who calls the moment awful, relating it back to the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md).

Torbra moves closer to the edge of the dome, being careful to remain within it. She places herself between the hunter and the rest of the party. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) casts Mage Armour on herself, while [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) casts Armour of Agathys on herself. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) considers using Giant's Might but recalls [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) telling her that it may collapse the dome.

Torbra observes the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) looking in the wrong direction, clearly not able to see her inside the dome. As she bends her elbow, her armour makes a sound, causing its head to swivel rapidly to look towards the source of the sound. Suddenly the hunter slashes both of its blade arms across the dome with force, its magical energy rippling with a wobble sound briefly, but it remains present and impervious.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) wakes up. Thanea questions how sturdy the dome is, answering that she isn't sure exactly, but expectant that it will hold. Her answer doesn't inspire confidence in Thanea. Thanea informs [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) that they have seen creatures like this before and aren't surprised to see one on this mission. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) confidently approaches the edge of the dome, getting a closer look at its physique, noting its alien and dangerous looking appearance.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)*
> Well this thing sure is ugly.

Saoirse ponders its appearance, wondering if this is a more "evolved" version of the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) they encountered previously. She takes a moment to commit what she sees to memory, wanting to be able to recall it with Minor Illusion upon their return to [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md).

As Saoirse is observing it, the [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) turns its head to look at something else, before it vanishes instantly and silently, teleporting out of sight. Its sudden disappearance shocks [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), but Saoirse isn't surprised.

## A Pair of Eyes

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) encourages everyone to look outside of the dome for the hunter, hoping to catch where it disappeared to. Nobody spots it.

Instead, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) spots the glowing purple eyes of a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), right at the edge of her monochrome darkvision, its eyes appearing white. She informs the party, everyone able to spot it too with her direction. The eyes remain still and constant, two orbs 
piercing the darkness with no deviation.

Saoirse wonders where the light is coming from, noting that usually the glow in an animal's eyes is reflected from elsewhere. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) points out the full moon, but Saoirse figures that it isn't providing enough light for the intensity of its glow. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) playfully encourages Saoirse to venture out of the dome, suggesting that she can simply run back in if attacked. She doesn't like the sound of the idea.

Saoirse picks up a small rock, casts Light on it, and throws it in the direction of the eyes by only putting her throwing arm outside of the dome. The awkward nature of the throw means the rock only travels 15ft, not nearly far enough to illuminate the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md).

Saoirse wonders how much longer the Tiny Hut will remain, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) stating there will be enough time for everyone to sleep. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) suggests everyone else goes back to bed while she finishes her watch. Everyone else gets back to sleep.

## Moving Eyes

Torbra's watch continues. There is no perceptible movement or happenings outside of the dome except for the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md)'s eyes which remain constant for the next two hours, until they suddenly vanish, taking her by surprise. She panics, searching her surroundings for the eyes but cannot find them, so she sits and keeps watch nervously.

15 minutes later the eyes reappear in the opposite direction, once again 60ft away. Torbra wakes up the rest of the party, telling them what has happened. She expresses her concern that whatever it is isn't leaving the party alone, its persistence troubling her.

Saoirse encourages her to leave it be as the dome is protecting them for now. Torbra realises that there are several hours until sunrise, worrying her further. When Torbra says that she is worried about being eaten, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) tells her simply to stay in the dome. Torbra states she plans to, but worries that it can see her through the dome's magical translucency.

Saoirse and [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) endeavour to return to sleep and get a full night's rest. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) is freaked out by the eyes and opts to stay up with Torbra, not having been able to sleep much anyway.

## A Hundred Eyes

Shortly after [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Saoirse fall asleep, the eyes once again disappear, the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) closing them to see how the party reacts. It takes Torbra a few minutes to react, her tiredness showing, but when she does, she mutters an expletive to herself, stands up, and searches for them again.

She finds the eyes of the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) in their original spot in the opposite direction. After a moment a second set of eyes begin to glow, followed by a third, a fifth, a tenth and so on, exponentially growing until there are 60 sets of eyes staring back at her, a huge crowd of eyes seemingly gathered in a group in one particular area 60ft away. It gives the impression of an army standing, waiting. The distance and height of each set of eyes varies, but each pair stares directly at the dome, no illumination of their source. The night is deathly silent.

The party is unaware that what they are seeing is one [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) and a large amount of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), strategically moved and shaped by the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) to give the impression of numbers, an intentional scare tactic.

Torbra immediately shouts for everyone to get up, horror in her voice at what she's seeing. Thanea curses while Torbra's nerves begin to fray, the situation utterly terrifying to her. As soon as [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) wakes up she re-casts Armour of Agathys, fearing that combat is incoming. Torbra nervously tightens her grip on her halberd.

Saoirse asks if she should magically create an intimidating animal sound again in an effort to ward the creatures off, but the party doesn't believe it will help. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) suggests throwing another glowing rock, Thanea taking her up on her suggestion. The rock only gets 15ft, providing no benefit. Thanea isn't surprised at her lack of strength.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) suggests Torbra has a go. Thanea casts Light on another rock, giving it to Torbra to throw. She throws it firmly, it landing right next to Thanea's rock. Torbra is disappointed in herself.

## Waiting for Sunlight

With only a few hours until sunrise, [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) try once again to go back to sleep. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) remain awake.

The eyes remain fixed in place, unchanging, for the next hour, before they all vanish in the same instant.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)*
> I don't think this is the last time we see these eyes, and I have a bad feeling that this is why we're here.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> I think you're right there. I'm just hoping that they don't do anything any time soon.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)*
> Yeah. They disappeared for now, but who knows if they come back.

Before long the first signs of sunrise begin to appear, the black sky beginning to turn dark shades of blue before turning peachy-red. An hour after the eyes disappeared, the sun crests the [Foss Peaks](../places/topography/mountains/foss-peaks.md) to the east, signalling the start of a new day.

Thanea suggests that the creatures only wanted to come out at night, Torbra hoping that they now leave them alone during the day. Torbra wonders if [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) will try shouting at them if they do. Thanea takes her comment literally, suggesting that these creatures aren't wolves, and she would know, having been raised in the forest. Nothing she saw overnight felt like normal predator behaviour.

As the shadows recede from the valley and sunlight hits the dome directly, the pair take stock of their surroundings, failing to notice the three [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) hiding in the long grass nearby. They realise that they have camped next to a hill that is split into tiers by shallow cliff edges, and that there is a similar cliff edge on the opposite side.

*[[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), Saoirse: short rest]*

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Saoirse wake. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) notices the position of the sun, realising that her Tiny Hut won't last much longer. She warns the party, suggesting that if anything is going to attack them when the dome collapses, they'd best be ready. Thanea tells the pair about the eyes disappearing before sunrise, which provides [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) relief, but Thanea cautions that they will have to deal with the eyes and/or the [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) soon enough.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) suggests that a pack of wolves from the valley may have came across the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) and became corrupted by [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), explaining the sheer quantity of eyes they witnesses. Thanea is worried by the notion, realising how bad that would be for them if the theory is true. She is hesitant to agree, failing to remember that the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) had glowing eyes, but Saoirse corrects her.

Saoirse realises that the "white" eyes everyone saw were a product of the monochromatic nature of their darkvision, so they can't be sure what they were looking at.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is keen to head out, asking where the party are headed. A discussion breaks out about where they are trying to go, confusion over where the party is exactly and the agreed plan from last night.

## [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) Strike

As the debate breaks out, [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s Tiny Hut ends, the magical dome collapsing. A second later, three [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) teleport into melee range of the party, blade arms already raised.

*[Initiative order begins]*

The [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) get the drop on the party, teleporting right into the middle of them. Each hunter hits a different person with a force blast, missing [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) but pushing [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) 10ft away and knocking them prone. One of the hunters darts for Saoirse, giving Thanea an opening to hit it with Shocking Grasp as it goes. It stutters as it moves, the lightning disrupting its movement.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) casts Bane on all three hunters, all of them succumbing to its effect. She inspires Thanea, shouting for her to "burn these fuckers".

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) casts Dispel Magic on the [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) in front of her, recalling [Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) casting the spell on the remaining [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) in [the Dog's Groke](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md). The bonds holding the hunter's dust together are too strong and willing for her magic to dispel it.

Torbra grows larger using Giant's Might, moving to flank the hunter in front of Thanea, flanking with [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md). She swings her halberd down at it, carving across its back, but not finding much purchase, the slashing damage resisted. She follows it up with a second hit but finds even less purchase. Digging deeper with Action Surge she swings desperately, hoping to inflict more damage. In total she lands all four hits, but her halberd proves ineffective, the hunter not even reacting to her hits, remaining focused on Thanea.

The two hunters amongst the party both turn to face [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), flanking her and attacking twice each with their blade arms. One manages to land both of its hits while the other misses both, before the pair teleport away in opposite directions, one appearing on a nearby small clifftop. The hits are enough to break [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s concentration on Bane. The other hunter slices down at Saoirse who is prone, slashing her twice.

Saoirse casts Armour of Agathys on herself before standing up and rotating around the hunter so that she's not pinned against the cliff edge.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Oh, fuck us.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) moves between Thanea and Torbra before casting Dissonant Whispers at one of the hunters that teleported away. She watches as it doesn't react to her spell, the realisation that her psychic spell has no effect on these creatures. She inspires Torbra. Thanea tries Dispel Magic again, this time on the hunter on the clifftop, but it again isn't able to break the dust's bonds.

Torbra charges at the hunter that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) just cast a spell at. As her halberd swings down at it, the [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) intentionally loosens the bonds of its [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), turning into a cloud of dust while her halberd sails through it harmlessly. As soon as she pulls back, the hunter reforms itself, the attack expertly nullified.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> Well that's cheating!

Frustrated by her foes' tricks, she lands a critical hit but lands a poor hit, made poorer by the hunter's resistance to slashing damage. She watches as the halberd slides over its stony exterior, fine shavings of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) kicked up by the blade, chipping away at its form slightly.

The [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) on the clifftop and the one in front of Saoirse both teleport to Torbra, two of them in flanking positions. Two of the hunters land both of their hits while the third blasts her with a force attack, not able to push and topple her. The sudden flurry of blows is a shock to her system as her wounds begin to bleed.

Saoirse casts Shatter, precisely placing it behind Torbra so that two of the hunters hear the piercing ringing sound. One takes the full force of the spell, Torbra observing it tense up neck muscles, an odd display of flesh and tendons that she recalls from her previous encounter with [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md).

## [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) Shifts

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) gets fed up with how ineffective her attacks have been on the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) so far, prompting her to shift into her Swiftstride form.

As the rage within her builds and she screams, her form begins to twist and change. Fur sprouts from her arms and face, her face turning into a fox-like snout. She hunches forward, adopting an animalistic stance. In this form she grows slightly more resilient and quicker on her feet.

She rushes to the hunter closest to her, adopting a flanking position with Torbra. She strikes it with her rapier, the blade feeling like it struck stone, getting little purchase. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is briefly puzzled as she has seen the hunters moving like flesh and blood creatures, but their physiology disagrees.

## On the Ropes

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) uses Radiant Soul to manifest her wings, flying 30ft straight upwards. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) takes a breath, using Second Wind to regain some health, before disengaging and running across the clearing back to [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md). 

As Torbra repositions, two of the hunters teleport to the nearby clifftop before shooting force blasts towards Thanea, attempting to knock her out of the sky. One misses but the other hits, causing her wings to buckle as she fails to stay airborne, beginning a 30ft plummet to the ground. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) sees this and reacts swiftly, casting Feather Fall to slow her descent, Thanea landing prone softly.

The third hunter slashes [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) twice, both attacks cutting her chest deep, bringing her to the edge of consciousness as her vision starts to narrow. Wounds inflicted, it then teleports behind Saoirse.

Saoirse circles round it before using Necrotic Shroud, her own necrotic winds fading into existence. The hunter isn't phased in the moment by her horrific appearance. She sticks her tongue out at her foe.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) rushes over to Saoirse's hunter, stabbing it with her rapier, the sharpened end pinging off its surface. She follows it up with her dagger, barely grazing it.

Thanea stands up, concentrates inwards on her magical font of power, and casts Fireball at the two hunters on the clifftop. Both are able to dodge the worst of the rapidly expanding fireball but still get scorched, one of them burning with extra radiance from her Radiant Soul.

## Allisa's Timely Arrival

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) notice a strange movement of light between them, as if their view of each other turns, like a mirror being rotated. A glowing three-sided rectangular seam appears, hovering in the air between them, as [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) steps through her Dimension Door, appearing between them. As soon as she does, the door shuts behind her quickly, the spatial disturbance vanishing.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Oh, hell no!

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), out of breath:*
> I'm sorry I'm late!

Allisa takes two steps into the open space between the party and the cliff that the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) are stood atop. She turns to [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), noticing her heavy wounds and erratic breathing. She touches her [Citrine Eye necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md) while tracing magical symbols in the air with her staff, then pointing it at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), casting Shield of Faith. A shimmering field of yellow light briefly envelops her as the magic takes effect.

*[Initiative order paused]*
