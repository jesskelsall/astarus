## Heading Down River

Having left [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) on a boat that they've bought, the party continues their way down the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md).

### [Beckermet](../places/towns/beckermet.md)

Travelling for about half a day, the sight of a town on the river's edge comes into view, with its guard towers near to the water's edge. This is [Beckermet](../places/towns/beckermet.md).

Realising that they should keep a low profile to avoid being detected by the [Beckermet](../places/towns/beckermet.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), they try to hide themselves. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md), [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md), and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) all pull their hoods over their heads while [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) navigates.

They are watched by one of the watchtower guards while they pass, but they either don't recognise them, or decide not to sound the alarm.

### [Howbridge](../places/towns/howbridge.md)

Just before nightfall the party arrives at the tight river bend down the hill from [Howbridge](../places/towns/howbridge.md). Initially the party decides to make camp underneath the giant wooden bridge that heads east out of town, choosing to light a fire despite the potential to be discovered.

Torbra goes to sleep, having been awake the longest.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) decide to investigate [Howbridge](../places/towns/howbridge.md). They make their way into the village via the bridge which takes them over the river and uphill. Immediately after arriving at the marketplace, the pair notice 2 pairs of [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) standing around, and a third larger one walking up the street towards them, some distance away.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) heads back to the rest of the party to inform them of the danger they're in, while [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) stays here and investigates. She heads into the inn, seeing another [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) inside enjoying a drink with the jovial locals who have packed into the inn.

She is eventually kicked out for wandering into the kitchen while looking for the bathroom. Once outside she converses with someone who is standing around outside. He reveals that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are hunting for [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), something that doesn't happen often. Like [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) he is passing through.

Back at camp, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) warn the group that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) here are aware of them. The group decides to head downstream another 15 minutes before camping on the eastern bank of the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md).

The party settles in for the night, taking shifts.

### [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) Deva Dream 3

While sleeping, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) has a dream.

She is in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md), on a city centre street. The road is narrow and packed with people. The buildings are tall and foreboding, hastily built wherever they fit.

The weather is cold, and is getting towards sunset.

Looking up, she spots a white light in the sky. Looking closer, she notices the streaking tail of a meteor. It gives the impression that the meteor is heading roughly in this direction, but off to one side.

From the corner of her vision she sees a flash of light as a figure darts into the sky in the direction of the meteor. They are bathed in white-yellow light, with similarly glowing wings.

Another figure streaks into the sky from her left, to meet a second meteor which [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) hadn't initially noticed. It is clear now that two figures are approaching two meteors.

Both figures impact the meteors, a flash of white light erupting from the impact. After a moment a booming rumble reaches ground level. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) sees them both struggling against the meteor, flapping their wings, attempting to resist their descent.

The people around her have started to look up, point at what they see, and become panicked and begin running. The street scene erupts into chaos.

Looking up again, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) sees a third meteor, larger than the other two, heading directly towards her. She panics, turning to run away. She looks back several times, seeing the meteor again each time. The second time she does this, a stranger shoulder barges her, forcing her to the ground. Now lying on her back, she looks up at the meteor, watching it as it grows in size from its approach. Another stranger steps over her, forcing their foot into [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)'s stomach as they attempt to step over her.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) gets up and observes the meteor again. As it gets closer, its white trail and glow turns purple, enveloping it in purple flames as it continues its descent.

She tries to wake up, recognising that she may be dreaming, but is unable to. Unsure of what to do, she cowers, covering her face and bracing for the worst.

Suddenly [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) feels a tap on her shoulder. As this happens, the sound of her surroundings fades away to a dull murmur. Looking for who tapped her, she looks up and sees Seraphina (her deva), her facial features unknowable and with her wings folded away. He offers [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) her hand, palm face up. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) offers her hand in return.

*[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md):*

> Who are you?

Seraphina doesn't reply, but [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) is able to comprehend a smile on her formless face. She looks up at the large meteor, unfurling her deva wings. Suddenly the pair are hurtling into the air in an instant, the ground below them shrinking rapidly as they ascend at a scarcely believable pace. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) screams her heart out.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) looks down and observes the city and its surroundings. She sees a river, with a tightly packed walled city next to it, near to a river delta, where the river meets the sea.

Looking up, the meteor gets increasingly close. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) looks down and notices a second set of flapping wings, identical to those of Seraphina. They are her own. Looking over to Seraphina, her palm is still outstretched in the same way as it was offered, with [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)'s hand on top. Seraphina retracts her hand, separating the pair. She drifts away, both [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) of them continuing their ascent.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) looks up once more and starts to panic, thinking too hard about her first flight, and starting to lose control. As she does, the dream ends.

## Torbra Standing Stones 1

During the second watch by [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md), [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) wakes up suddenly, once again hearing the guttural chanting voices in her head. She gets up out of the tent and looks around. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) sees her wake and asks if everything is okay, but Torbra ignores her, clearly on a mission.

It is pitch black, but Torbra sees a faint glow coming from over the next hill. She begins walking towards it, speeding up as she goes. The closer she gets, the louder they get. She perseveres, with [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) following her out of both curiosity and frustration.

Heading over the hill, Torbra finds a collection of large stones in a grassy clearing, illuminated by a faint aura of light. She heads to the closest stone and begins inspecting them, one by one.

| Stone | Rune | Torbra's Actions | Appearance | Voices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sunk into ground. | None | Touches it, tries to dig it up but it is deep set. | Large buried stone. | *Learn the ways of our people. Learn the ways of your people.* (repeated)
| Sunk into ground. | None | Touches it. | Large buried stone. | No change.
| Collapsed onto ground. | Stone Rune | Touches it. | Grey brown glow emanates as a crack shifts into a runic shape. Light surrounds her. | *Practice. Apply. Grow.* (repeating)
| Collapsed onto ground. | Frost Rune | Touches it. | Same as above, but sky blue glow. | *Embrace who you have always been. Go forth and seek.* (once, voices stop)

*[[Torbra Tauff](../../../astarus/people/torbra-tauff.md) unlocks her Rune Knight abilities]*

While this is happening, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) is looking on in bemusement. She cannot see any of the glowing light, the runes, or hear the voices. She touches a stone but finds it to be inert and unremarkable.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md), under her breath:*

> What. The fuck.

After the last rune reveals itself and the voices stop, the glow of the runes and standing stones fades away, leaving Torbra stood in a grassy field in the pitch black darkness.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) shouts at Torbra for wandering off and being weird, wondering what happened. Torbra isn't sure, explaining that something indescribable happened to her. Torbra compares the situation to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) touching the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) and passing out. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) thinks that perhaps Torbra appears taller, but Torbra doesn't agree.

They both make their way back to camp, finishing off the night's rest. Torbra feels invigorated by the experience, spending the night scratching the runes she saw into the dirt, attempting to match what she saw.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) casts the Light spell on the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) as a light source, placing it back in its cloth bag to provide a dull glow. The [Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) does nothing extraordinary.

*[Long rest]*

## Sarleen Finds the Party

As the sun begins to rise, the party sees an unfamiliar person on the horizon, on their side of the river (east), making their way towards them. This is [Sarleen Truestriker](../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md).

She advises the party that they're not too far from a village and don't need to camp here. As the rest of the party wake up and emerge from their tends, she recognises the tall blue person ([Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)) and the human with grey skin ([Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md)). Her search is successful.

Sarleen informs the party that she is an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) in [Goshawk Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md). Her [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md), [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md), tasked her and the other hands of the squad with finding the party after receiving word from [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) that he had been captured.

The party is startled to find someone with specific knowledge of them, and of Wrenn's situation. Initially the party believes that Sarleen is talking about Wrenn getting into trouble in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), but she clarifies that he sent the message after being captured by bandits.

Sarleen tells the group that her mission is to bring the party to Hidaar in the village of [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md), where he is waiting for her return. The squad was sent up towards [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md), each hand taking a different route so they could increase their chance of finding them. Hidaar intends to help get them into [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) so that they can seek [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

The party is reluctant to trust Sarleen. Her knowing who they are immediately puts them on edge due to the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) that they know are hunting them, but Sarleen manages to convince them that she is here to help. Willing to take the risk on a stranger instead of passing up an offer of help, they reluctantly agree to be escorted by her.

With their boat only able to seat 4 comfortably, they decide to walk along the east bank of the river. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) decides to drag the boat along with her, not willing to part with the 50 gp investment they made in it.

## Gnolls On the Cliffs

At nightfall the party sets up camp along the east bank of the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md). They find a spot under 20ft tall cliffs, in a reasonably sized area. They set up a campfire. When Sarleen offers to take first watch, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) insists on staying up with her.

As their watch progresses, they hear growling sounds, seemingly from the cliffs above. Suddenly crossbow bolts are loosed at them, signalling the start of combat, an unknown threat on the cliffs above.

As the rest of the party are woken from their sleep, the party gets their first look at the gnolls on the cliffs above. Sarleen climbs a 10ft half-way cliff where she finds a gnoll, and engages with it.

The Gnoll Flesh Gnawer, their leader, attempts to climb down the cliff to attack them, getting half-way down before tumbling the rest of the way - a clumsy start to their ambush.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Faerie Fire on the other gnolls shooting down from the cliffs above, giving the rest of the party a chance to hit them in the dark.

While Torbra charges forward to fight their leader head on, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) retreat, heading away from the cliffs and campfire to hide in the darkness beyond it. From here they are able to attack with ranged spells.

Sarleen continues fighting the first gnoll on the cliffs, disengaging it to try and draw it away from the party. The gnoll instead jumps down from the cliff to meet the party. Sarleen improvises, jumping from the cliff to land a strike on the gnoll as she falls.

When the gnoll leader disengages from Torbra and goes for [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), she casts Summon Beast to summon a land Bestial Spirit to attack it with. While it keeps it busy, Torbra comes back round and finishes the leader gnoll off.

The battle now clearly in the party's favour, the last few gnolls desperately move in for the kill, but fall through the combined efforts of the party.

With that, the gnolls are dead. Some money and crossbow bolts are taken from their corpses. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) opts to loot a crossbow to give her some ranged versatility.

The party settles back down for what is left of the evening's rest, confident that the threat has been dealt with.

*[Long rest]*
