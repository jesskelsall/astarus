## Before the Match

While [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) wait to enter the arena, [Gloom Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md) appear from behind. [Ophelia Phantom](../characters/ophelia-phantom.md) gossips about their previous competitors, [Horizon Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/horizon-squad.md). [Norma Collarbone](../characters/norma-collarbone.md) complains that Ophelia put herself forward as the squad's acting [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) for the tournament.

Norma offers both squads a smoke. Ophelia takes one, as does [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), who is keen to impress despite her young age. Norma asks where the party is from. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) gives a half-explanation of how they're from all over and have been getting into all kinds of trouble.

Ophelia waxes lyrical about [Gloom Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md)'s anti-capitalist ideals. Norma asks the party why they are competing in the tournament. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) explains that the party stumbled into it, much to Ophelia's annoyance. Norma applauds their carefree nature, which [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) shoots down, explaining that she no longer lives in the forest as she wanted. [Moss Gloomhollow](../characters/moss-gloomhollow.md) offers [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) a rat, which she accepts.

When Norma suggests both squads blow off the fight and go do something else, Saoirse warns [Gloom Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md) that they're in trouble once they're in the arena. Various people rise to the smack talk. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) explains how [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s match against [Mortar Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) went, only mentioning [Reozin Ironhide](../characters/reozin-ironhide.md) as a credible threat.

As an [Astorrel Member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) tells both squads that the match is about to start, Norma wishes the party good luck. Both squads enter the arena and prepare to battle.
