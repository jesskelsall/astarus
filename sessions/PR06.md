## Dreaming

*See: [Thanea Deva Dream 2](../dreams/deva-thanea-2.md)*

During the night [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) has a dream. She wakes up suddenly in a cold sweat.

## The Middle of the Night

Thanea wakes up from her dream in a cold sweat, screaming. This wakes up everyone but [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md).

Thanea reveals that she had a dream about the meteor. When asked where it landed, she explained that the crater was massive and everything was burning, so she doesn't understand how it's not been found yet. She doesn't reveal all of the dream's details, but does say that it ended with the rest of the party ending up dead here in this barn.

She also revealed that she often has weird dreams, with their contents often coming true. She tries to pay them no mind but doesn't always succeed. She doesn't like that she gets these dreams.

Torbra is eventually woken by the sound of everyone else talking, though she doesn't wake fully, and by morning she can't remember having woken at all.

*[Long rest]*

## Continuing North West

### 07:00

The party wakes up. Saoirse knocks on the [Hurley Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hurley-farm.md) door and asks Janus if they are able to provide breakfast. He is, though there's not much in and it won't be special. The entire party enters the farm into its main room which is basic and full of farming tool clutter. Janus prepares simple meat and bread sandwiches with leftovers. The party sits quietly while they eat, Saoirse occasionally petting Patch as he comes and goes.

### 08:00

The party departs heading north west. Patch follows them for close to a mile before leaving the party to their travels. The marching order is Thanea, Torbra, Saoirse/[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).

## Entering the Forest

### 09:15

The party reaches the forest's edge. North west is a less dense part of the forest which is somewhat set back from the rest. Thanea, going off what she saw in her dream, assumes a less dense forest is correct as she was able to run through it in her dream.

Torbra and Saoirse find a tall tree which they both climb to get a better view. Torbra sees that there is a natural path through the forest where the foliage is thinner. From up the tree it is clear that there is a worn path that can be followed.

Saoirse takes a swig of alcohol while up the tree before descending. She slips and falls on her tail bone.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) sees a disturbed path through the forest - a trail of broken branches and pushed foliage/leaves, all leading out of the forest. They decide to follow it. These disturbances become more apparent as they proceed.

Torbra suggests that this path was made by running animals, likely from the meteor itself. They begin tracking the trail to its source. They begin to find spots of blood, confirming that they're going the right way.

### 11:00

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) spots a dead wolf in a small clearing ahead. She approaches it carefully and sees no movement. It is covered in blood and full of slicing lacerations on both its underside and sides, spilling its guts outwards. They look like sword slices. Judging by the blood trails it looks like it wasn't wounded here, but got this far before dying. It looks like it has been dead for about one day.

The trails that the party has been following turn left near where the dead wolf lies. The foliage becomes denser in this direction. The trail begins to dry up as the blood starts to disappear and the disturbed foliage becomes less noticeable.

Torbra and Thanea succeed on dexterity saving throws.
Saoirse fails a dexterity saving throw - natural 1.

While the party is wading through the bushes, Saoirse's foot gets caught on something and she falls flat on her face, falling into a thorny bush and taking 2 points of piercing damage. She yelps as she falls, disappearing into the bushes.

The party helps her up out of the thorny bush, carefully moving it out of the way. Her foot is still stuck however. Torbra notices that her foot is stuck in a fine crevasse which is about as wide as her foot. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) uses Mold Earth to open up the gap enough to squeeze Saoirse's foot free.

Saoirse takes a swig from her flask. Torbra attempts to take the flask from her. A contested strength check has Saoirse keep hold of her flask. Torbra angrily complains about how much she's drinking and how getting drunk is a liability when they're tracking something dangerous.

## Finding the Cave

### 11:30

Torbra follows the crack through the bushes - west initially, but then when it peters out she follows it east instead. After almost giving up, Torbra rounds another bush and comes across a larger opening which is 6ft wide and with a sudden drop. There is a visible hole which does not appear recent.

The bottom of the hole is dark but appears sloped, taking turns as it descends. Thanea casts Light on a stick and throws it into the hole. It bounces a few times before coming to rest in the bottom, obscured by one of the turns of the opening, revealing an immediate drop of 5ft.

Most of the party sees blood splattered on the opening's walls as the glowing stick passes them, including bloody wolf footprints on the floor. Saoirse throws another stick in the hole so that Thanea can see the blood.

Torbra dangles Saoirse into the hole by holding her ankles but loses her grip, dropping Saoirse on her head into the hole. She can see a gap leading further down into a cave, 6ft tall and 4ft wide - big enough to squeeze through it. Thanea, Torbra and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) also descend into the passage. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) turns into a badger as she goes.

### 12:30

The party follows the crevasse-like cave passageway to a medium sized room. It is filled with 6 dead wolves and a lot of blood splashed on the walls and floor. These wolves also have the same slashing wounds that were seen on the wolf outside.

There is a crack in the far left corner where water is trickling in through the rock before creating a very shallow stream that descends further into the cave, lapping over the rocks haphazardly.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) in badger form smells an unrecognisable smell deeper down the tunnel and screeches to alert the group to her findings.

## The Main Chamber

The path leads deeper before opening out into a huge chamber. There is a pool of water to the left which the streaming water trickles into. The room is 40ft wide and much deeper, too far to see. There is light coming from the other side of the room - on the far right hand side there is a small opening in the roof with sunlight pouring in through it. There is also an obscured source of light beyond a mound in the middle of the room, illuminating mostly the ceiling with brilliant white light.

Saoirse fills her now empty flask with water from the cave pool and takes a drink.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Saoirse begin exploring the cave over to the right hand side. Thanea begins approaching the sources of light across the cave.

Torbra proceeds back to the previous chamber and has a look for herself at what happened here. She finds the slash wounds and at least one wolf with guts splayed across the floor. There are also small bones and animal excrement here that suggests this was the wolves' den.

Saoirse and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) join Thanea who begins ascending the mound of loose stones and gravel in the middle of the room, with the source of brilliant white light beyond it. It is 10ft tall and just as wide, creating a slope that takes more effort to ascend. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is picked up by Saoirse who carries her to the top before putting her down.

Torbra catches back up and is at the bottom of the mound when the rest of the party crests its top.

## First Contact

Saoirse, Thanea and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) crest the mound and see what is on its other side. The mound is actually a crater of stones centered around a 1ft diameter orb ([Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md)) that is brilliant white and the source of the glow. It is perched on a small rise of rocks in the crater's center. The crater is smaller than the one in her dreams, about 30ft in diameter.

Thanea remarks under her breath that this is just like from in her dream.

There are larger rocks on the right hand side of the crater around where the sunlight is streaming through - rocks that were once part of the cave roof and have collapsed when the meteor punched a hole through.

Left of the orb are 2 piles:

- 2 wolves (similar wounds to the ones seen so far).
- 6 people (Saoirse recognises one - an adventurer they crossed paths with yesterday).

Saoirse sees a grey dog-like creature ([Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md)) near the pile of bodies. It looks like a quadrupedal creature that is slightly larger than a wolf. It is mostly featureless and dark grey, with 2 hind legs, 2 front legs that come to blades on its front, with 2 humanoid arms with hands & elbows attached behind its front blade arms.

The orb changes colour from white to deep purple very suddenly. The moment it does this, the creature spins around and faces the party, revealing its mostly featureless face. It has ears and two purple glowing eyes that stare intently at the party.
