## Pre-session

### [Inspiration Pool](../mechanics/dm-inspiration.md)

2 dice.

## What Remains of the Hunter

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) begin to calm down having defeated the two [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) that attacked them while hiking through the night. One lies dead nearby, a pile of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) all that remains of its body, while the second fled into the darkness to the south.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) comes down from her rage, checking her surroundings while asking the party what they just fought, but everyone is too stunned or injured to respond. She begins searching for the hunter's remains, [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) supporting her search by casting Dancing Lights. Ahsha is unable to find anything amongst the long grass.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) ponders what these creatures are, wondering if they are arcane in nature. Ahsha asks if they're native to this region but Ephaine is certain they aren't. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) states that she originally thought they were wolves, but clearly not. Ahsha explains the feeling that her [Schiller Steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe seemed to do a fair bit of damage to them. Ahsha thanks Noon for his Dancing Lights, also going out of her way to thank his shadow who she looks around for, not seeing it.

Noon takes a moment to search for the remains himself, stumbling across a pile of dark grey dust that is finer than sand and dry, scattered across the long grass nearby. He points the party over to it. Noon tentatively grabs a handful, observing that it flows between his fingers like sand would, before methodically brushing every grain of it from his hands.

Ahsha suggests the party gets some rest before proceeding. She hears wolves howling to the south, echoing from far away. It is less chatty than usual, sounding more perfunctory. Ahsha wonders if they should search for tracks from here, suggesting [Kiln squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) may have been involved with these creatures. Korina points out that she is unable to see far in the dark, which convinces Ahsha that the best course of action is to sleep now and search when it is light.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## Searching for Tracks

After sleeping through the early morning, the party rises, ready to search for the tracks. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) uses the moment to investigate the pile of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) for herself, in particular searching for a smell. She finds it odourless, finding its lack of a scent abnormal.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) leads the party in tracking the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md), picking up the trail by retracing the wolf pack's tracks. She observes footprints that are crescent moon shaped, the inside of the moon pointing away from the direction of travel. The gaps between the footprints are large, underlying these creatures' speed.

As she begins following the trail, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) wonders if this is a good spend of their time, noting the timer looming over their [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission ([Rescue Kiln Squad](../storylines/rescue-kiln-squad.md)). Ahsha argues that these creatures may account for [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md)'s disappearance, especially as there is little else going on out in these rural parts. She asks for the party's opinion, seeking a majority vote. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) is supportive. Ephaine is still wary of how much time they'll spend on this, Noon agreeing, suggesting limiting the time they spend on the search. Ahsha compromises, deciding that they'll spend the rest of the day searching.

Ephaine leads the horse while Ahsha leads on, following the tracks as they run vaguely parallel to the valley's trail. Ephaine keeps watch while Ahsha's head is focused down on the tracks. Korina keeps an eye on the party's rear, seeing little. Ephaine notices the first signs of the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) appearing to the northeast, snowcapped mountains visible on the distant hazy horizon. Beyond that, deer can be seen drinking from the stream further ahead and birds can be heard going about their day.

By the afternoon the trail starts to veer west, closer to the trail, the first deviation in the trail so far. As she goes she notices one of the two sets of tracks disappear periodically, assuming that this is where one of the pair teleported. The wolf tracks stay close to the hunters' tracks. As the hunters' tracks begin moving even closer to the trail, the trail ends abruptly, Ahsha convinced that she's not missed anything - the tracks simply end (where the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) first created these [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md)).

The party fans out into the nearby grassy surroundings, but nobody does a good job of searching around, missing traces of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) amongst the grass leading northeast to [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md). As far as they can tell there is nothing untoward about where they are. The grass is undisturbed beyond here, while typically the hunters' tracks were accompanied by disturbed grass as their bodies pushed through the taller foliage.

Stumped, Ahsha asks the party what they should do next. Ephaine is out of ideas.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Well, the trail has gone cold, so the only thing we can do is carry on.

Ahsha agrees, noting that this is something they can ask the [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) locals about upon their arrival. The party picks up the trail again, Ahsha continuing to look for tracks as she goes, not finding any.

## Entering the [Albulain Valley](../places/plains-valleys/albulain-valley.md)

The party reaches the northern extent of [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md), a 500ft wide corridor that forms its narrowest extent where the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) intrude on the valley floor, the trail ahead seen rising into the gap. As they reach this point night begins to fall.

The party camps for the night, wolf howling once again heard to the distant south, signalling the party having survived the land under their influence.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

Proceeding into the narrowest part of the valley, a strong frost from overnight lingers low in the valley, the shadows from close tall hills lingering much longer than in the valley proper, keeping the frost alive that much longer.

By midday the party crests one of many hills along this section, glimpsing the [Albulain Valley](../places/plains-valleys/albulain-valley.md) for the first time, stretching far ahead of them. The clear and crisp day gives sight to the greenery at the bottom of the valley, the land sloping gently down to the west to the lake at its bottom. To the west are jagged arid peaks, contrasted to the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) to the east which retain what little snow has fallen on them already.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) spots familiar stone and thatch farmsteads as well as tiny white spots in groups that she recognises as flocks of sheep grazing.

*[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> Is this where you grew up? Did you grow up around this kind of house and setting?

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> This is exactly where I grew up, actually. This is home.  
> I haven't been back since I had to flee, so I don't really know what's going to greet us here. I don't know what sort of welcome we're going to get.

*[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> How long ago did you have to flee?

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> Well, it was almost three years ago now. When, you know, I had to seek asylum with the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), and, uh... here we are now.

Ahsha hopes Ephaine's welcome home is a warm one and offers help if she needs anything. Ephaine is appreciative of the sentiment.

Ahsha asks Ephaine where they should go, asking if there is a nearby village. Ephaine explains that there is a central village area but otherwise it is mostly spread out farmsteads. She mentions the [Seren Farmstead](../places/buildings/houses/seren-farmstead.md) as an option, wondering if they would all be welcome at home. Otherwise they could head into the middle of the village and stay at the inn there. Ahsha likes the idea of staying with a more known quantity if Ephaine isn't uncomfortable visiting home. Ephaine is fine with going, leading the party down into the valley.

For the next 2 hours Ephaine leads the party down the trail and into the valley proper. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears in [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md)'s vision, walking alongside Ephaine, not interacting with Noon. In a moment that Ephaine turns to get her bearings, Noon disappears.

After passing the first few farmsteads, Ephaine recognises exactly where she is, making her way uphill to the east in the direction of the [Seren Farmstead](../places/buildings/houses/seren-farmstead.md). The grass underfoot is verdant but clearly autumnal, many of the flowers dying back for the winter already. Nevertheless she runs her hand through the taller grass as she goes, reminiscing on simpler times. She looks around, recognising where she is, not seeing any notable changes since she was last here. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) puts her foot in muddy ground where water is streaming down the hillside as it may.

## Coming Home

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) finds the [Seren Farmstead](../places/buildings/houses/seren-farmstead.md), a cobbled stone building with a thatched roof with a lean-to attached to the side. She spots two nearby sheep grazing, and a larger pack further up the hill on the other side of the farmstead.

Nebula, the Schaef family's new brown and white border collie, comes rushing out from behind the building, barking as it goes. Once it arrives it circles the party, barking throughout. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) asks who the dog is, Ephaine assuming it is a new work dog. Ephaine leans over to encourage it over, Nebula eventually rushing over, leaning into Ephaine momentarily while she pets her, before she excitedly circles the group again. She is full of enthusiasm, alerting the farmstead of something interesting outside.

[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md) appears in front of the farmstead, shouting after Nebula, wondering what she is barking at. He looks upon the party, spotting a familiar figure.

*[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md):*
> Ephaine? Ephaine! Is that you?

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> Hi daddy.

Schaef breaks into a run, desperately trying to reach his daughter. He gets half way before stumbling slightly, Nebula running over to him and investigating before going back to circling and barking. Schaef continues but quickly gets out of breath, falling to his knees. Ephaine rushes over to him as he goes. She reaches him, embracing him with a big hug while he is still on his knees. Schaef looks up at her, holding back tears.

*[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md):*
> I knew you'd be back!

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> Of course! As soon as I could. Y'all got the letters from me, right? I didn't hear from y'all.

Schaef is in disbelief, shaking his head at the sight of his daughter. He confirms that they received the letters, laughing about the fruitcake being a nice touch. Ahsha tries to pet Nebula but she will not stay put.

The front door of the farmstead opens, [Adalie Seren](../characters/adalie-seren.md) standing in it. Comet, the family's other (black) border collie comes rushing out from the interior, joining Nebula in encircling the party and "herding" them excitedly. Without much fanfare, Ephaine's mother shouts to her:

*[Adalie Seren](../characters/adalie-seren.md):*
> You took yer time.

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> Hi momma. I'm sorry.

Ephaine excuses her manners, introducing the rest of [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) one by one. Schaef goes person to person as she does, shaking their hand with both of his, introducing himself by name. He wears a youthful excited look on his face which only gets more excited as he greets Ahsha, but [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) in particular, revelling in meeting such fantastical people.

*[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md), to Korina:*
> Well by gosh darn, you're a tall one, ain't ya?

Noon bows politely, formally introducing himself by name. Schaef responds with a firm pat on the shoulder, his informal rural greeting catching him out. Schaef whistles, causing the dogs to fall in line. He introduces them both by name, Ephaine telling him that they're both well named.

Ephaine asks about [Tamman Seren](../characters/tamman-seren.md) and her younger siblings, wondering if they're in good health. Schaef's excitement leaves his face instantly, a sombre tone overtaking the conversation.

*[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md):*
> Well, Besar and Irla are inside, but...

Schaef trails off, shaking his head, not able to vocalise his thoughts. Ephaine fears the worst for a moment, stuttering the beginnings of a response, too shocked to speak.

*[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md):*
> Oh, he's not dead. But he's not here.

Ephaine is relieved, asking if Tamman is safe. Schaef reluctantly tells her that he doesn't know. When Ephaine asks if the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) took him, Schaef explains that he took his own leave. Ephaine suggests that at his age, wanting to strike out on one's own isn't too unusual.

Schaef shouts back to Adalie, stating that they have guests, and ordering her to begin making some food in preparation. Adalie heads inside without response, leaving the front door open.

Ahsha is keen to accept their hospitality but hesitates for a second, checking with Ephaine that they're okay to be here. Ephaine assures them that they are, extending her father's hospitality in her own way. She heads back to the front door and strides inside, as if she'd never left.

## The Schaef Household

One by one the party makes their way into the [Seren Farmstead](../places/buildings/houses/seren-farmstead.md), stepping into what is effectively the kitchen, a smell of recently baked bread overtaking them. They observe the well used space, supplies in every corner, no space left untouched. Ephaine recognises the doors to each bedroom.

[Besar Seren](../characters/besar-seren.md) and [Irla Seren](../characters/irla-seren.md) are playing at the table when the party enter, going quiet at the sight of strangers. They don't initially recognise Ephaine, but as soon as she comments on how tall they've grown they realise who she is, shouting her name and jumping up to hug her fondly.

The pair of children glance at [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md). Besar is awestruck at the sight of a dragonborn, Irla retreats around Ephaine's leg to break her view of Ahsha. Besar gasps, asking Korina if she's a dragonborn. Korina says she is before the child punches her shin guard and eyes up her mace, then looking back at Ephaine in amazement. Ephaine gives the pair a stern talk, reminding them that these people are guests, to be treated with respect, and not to be asked intrusive questions.

[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md) comes inside and closes the door, smiling at the interaction between the children and Ephaine's friends. [Adalie Seren](../characters/adalie-seren.md) can be seen chopping vegetables at the counter on the other side of the room, keeping to herself, wary of military types in her home. Ephaine goes over to help, grabbing vegetables and a knife and cutting along with her. It takes a moment before Adalie even acknowledges her.

*[Adalie Seren](../characters/adalie-seren.md):*
> Nice to see you again Ephaine.

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> Nice to see you too momma.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) is looking around the room, choosing to stay in a corner, allowing the interactions to play out around him. He spots two small carved wolf statues on an upper shelf, showing a basic level of craftsmanship. Noon gives the appearance of someone uncomfortable in such a rural setting.

Schaef sits the children down at the table briefly and converses idly with them, calming them both down. After a while he looks up at Noon, checking him over, chuckling before speaking:

*[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md):*
> Well, you're not as strange around here as these two, but you look equally out of place.

Noon is polite in his response, suggesting he isn't as used to being in such an active household. Schaef smiles back, saying that's how his family likes it and that he finds it quaint, a traditional way of life passed down through the generations. Noon suggests it's up to him to get used to it, earning Schaef's respect.

## Why We're Here

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) gets down to business, regretfully telling the Schaefs that they're here on [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) business. She is careful with what she says around the children, only asking if anyone has seen [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) around these parts recently, describing what she knows of each [Kiln squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) member.

When [Adalie Seren](../characters/adalie-seren.md) says that they don't like military types here, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) is quick to offer an explanation of her own membership in the military, calling it necessary after what happened. Adalie turns to Ephaine, looking her over, her eyes not drifting far from her [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) badge. After a few moments she leans in and prods the badge with her index finger.

*[Adalie Seren](../characters/adalie-seren.md):*
> Well it might be a different shape, but it's still a badge.

Adalie looks across the rest of the party with an intense gaze, Ephaine and Noon clocking the mix of fury (that Schaef invited them in) and jumpiness (members of the military in her house) at the current situation. Ahsha apologies at any discomfort, but states that they need to find the missing [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) that they're looking for. The sooner they find the information they need, the sooner they'll be gone.

[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md) recalls what he knows to Ephaine, telling her of the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) heading south recently, but before that there was a "bunch of square badges" that came through [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md). Ephaine asks if it was about a month and a half ago, Schaef suggesting that seems about right, but that he didn't meet them. When Ahsha asks if he knows anyone that did, Schaef points them to "the street", referring to the village centre.

Ephaine changes subject, telling Schaef that they came across strange creatures a few days back, asking if everything is fine with the flock. He tells her that everything has been fine, though it has taken two seasons to get the flock back to strong numbers. Ephaine explains that these creatures were killing the wolf packs, suggesting their strength as wolves are to be feared. She worries what might happen if they come across a flock of sheep, or even a person. Schaef knows nothing, suggesting that he would if anything like that had shown itself, stating that there's nothing in the hills that hunt the wolves.

Ephaine asks Adalie, suggesting she might know more as she knows the hills more. The only oddity that she points out is that the wolves have been "chattier" than usual. Ahsha is conscious of whether the Schaefs are hiding anything, but suggests no lies or ill intent.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) asks if there are any rumours of [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) not affiliated with the military present in the area, wondering to himself if someone may have summoned the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) that they fought. Schaef goes very quiet, giving Ephaine a knowing look, the pair aware of the astral magic present in [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md). Ephaine shoots a strong look at Noon in response. Schaef plainly tells Noon that there's nothing like that around here except for Ephaine, obviously.

Noon doesn't believe him, trying to check his face for signs of a lie. Ephaine uses Woe to twist fate slightly against Noon, making it harder for him to tell. Regardless he can tell that Schaef is blatantly lying, trapped by the question, beginning to perspire. Ephaine asks if everything is otherwise okay, Schaef confirming it is.

Ephaine suggests to the party that they could stay here a few days and help with errands, Adalie's shoulders tensing up at the notion of strangers in her house any longer. Ahsha agrees, suggesting they may need to stick around a while. Ephaine asks Schaef if that's okay, his confirmation coming readily. She then asks Adalie who plainly says that if Schaef says it's okay, then it is, washing her hands of the decision.

## Dinner is Served

An hour or so passes as dinner is being prepared, the party making themselves as comfortable as they can in the cramped conditions, not enough chairs to sit everyone plus the children. Ephaine observes the children going to their rooms, Ephaine realising that her and [Tamman Seren](../characters/tamman-seren.md)'s rooms are no longer theirs due to their absences.

[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md) brings his cutting log in from outside for Noon to sit on. Dinner is served, a root vegetable hotpot with mutton in it, a simple meal that required only some vegetable preparation and an hour of cooking in the hearth.

While eating, Schaef asks [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) what makes her so special, keen to learn more about the dragonborn. Korina isn't sure she follows his questioning, Schaef responding that they don't give square badges to anyone. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) readily divulges her physical prowess, Schaef listening along intently, amazed by who she is and what she can do. When she finishes he turns straight to Ephaine, asking about her abilities:

*[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md):*
> I suppose it wasn't a one-off then?

She explains that it wasn't, reminding her parents that there's always been some sort of magical power that she could tap into, great favour coming to the family through it, a force she can now choose to lean on. Schaef states that she "has the stars in her", asking if she can perform magic readily. Ephaine sheepishly nods, not wishing to recant her exploits and the danger that her party has been under since joining the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Schaef asks the rest of the party if they've witnessed Ephaine's power first hand, everyone confirming they have. Ahsha states that Ephaine has saved their skins on more than one occasion, which Schaef is incredibly proud of.

Schaef fixates on Korina again, trying to resume a conversation not really started. He asks her if she's just good with her mace or if there's more to her. She doesn't downplay her strength but suggests that she is also good at getting others to follow her orders, alluding to her magic. Schaef asks if that is the case, why does Ahsha have more stripes on her badge. Ahsha is dismissive of the question, suggesting it was their [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md)'s decision, and that despite Korina being a late addition to the team, she can more than pull her weight.

Adalie asks Ephaine if she is safe in the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Ephaine suggests that she is, though it is hard work. She explains that she won't be with them forever, seeing a path to citizenship that will get her out of the military and back to the [Seren Farmstead](../places/buildings/houses/seren-farmstead.md) full time. She makes it clear that she wants to return and help out. Adalie tells her that they only want her to come home, Ephaine stating that it'll be soon. Adalie hopes she is right, pointing out Schaef's age and the need for her help, but that they'll wait.

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> In the meantime I can't believe how big Irla's gotten. She wasn't more than a toddler when I left, and now she's so big! I feel like I'm missing so much, I wish I could stay.

*[Adalie Seren](../characters/adalie-seren.md):*
> You should see her run after the dogs. I'm seeing more of you in her every single day.

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> Hopefully not everything's the same...

Schaef turns his attention to [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md), calling him too fancy looking from out here. He explains that he's from [Kardanis](../places/regions/kardanis.md), but Schaef has never heard of the place, stating he's not interested in where he's from, but what he's about.

Noon dodges his question by offering a demonstration, not holding back. He casts Dancing Lights, three orbs of light circling above their heads over the table gently, changing colours as they go. Schaef looks up in astonishment, asking Noon if he's doing this and if Ephaine can do such magic too before shouting for the children. [Besar Seren](../characters/besar-seren.md) and [Irla Seren](../characters/irla-seren.md) bolt from their rooms, arriving to see the lights, looks of wonderment overtaking their faces. Adalie sits still throughout, watching the expression on Ephaine's face carefully.

Ephaine asks Adalie for anything that might have been broken recently. As Schaef clears the table, Adalie fetches a broom with a snapped handle from the corner of the room, placing both halves on the table. Ephaine casts Mending, a brief glow of starlight emanating from her hands as the break vanishes, the broom fixed. She hands it back to Adalie who swishes it through the air and inspects the handle, impressed by her work.

Ephaine uses the demonstration to suggest that they can be useful while here. Adalie breaks the broom over her knee and hands both halves back to Ephaine who is confused for a moment, asking what her mother wants her to do with it. Adalie explains that she wanted to be sure it wasn't some sort of cheap trick. Ephaine casts Mending a second time, fixing the broom again. With a satisfied nod Adalie returns it to its home in the corner of the room.

*[Adalie Seren](../characters/adalie-seren.md):*
> Well, I guess magic ain't all just about killing people.

Ahsha once again offers the party's help around the farmstead if they are to stay. Schaef asks if she knows how to herd sheep, Ahsha incredibly dismissive of her skills with animals. Schaef instead suggests she can cut firewood, which Ahsha is enthused about. Schaef isn't sure what Korina can help with, not having a need for skills with a mace.

## The Stars Are Right

[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md) asks [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) if she still keeps a star map, which she confirms, explaining that she's working to improve it, unfolding it on the table. It is clear to everyone that he knows what he's looking at, pointing to a minor labelled star, informing Ephaine that its name is misspelled. Otherwise he is impressed, congratulating her on the details.

*[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md):*
> This is great! Dare I say it, this is more detailed than my daddy's.

Ephaine is happy that he is proud of her, explaining that she had access to means of looking closer at the stars during her [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) training.

Schaef encourages Ephaine to visit the [Shrine to the Stars](../places/structures/shrine-to-the-stars.md) while here, hopeful that she will find good omens there. He goes to the front door, opens it, checks the evening sky above, then comes back in, informing Ephaine that it looks like a good night for it. Ephaine is responsive, wondering if she should go alone or not. Schaef offers to show her to the base of the trail, but Ephaine is confident that she can find it.

Schaef asks [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) what other magic he can do. He freezes up, unable to choose something family friendly, prompting Schaef to dismiss his query, asking to see more later.

Over the next two hours [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) improves her star map with the help of [Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md), finishing the improvements that will allow her to cast Augury. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) spars with [Besar Seren](../characters/besar-seren.md) using sticks reclaimed from the area, showing him her [Schiller Steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe at one point. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) amuses [Irla Seren](../characters/irla-seren.md) with Dancing Lights, then Control Flames, but [Adalie Seren](../characters/adalie-seren.md) tells him off immediately - not in the house. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) rests quietly, to be sat for a change.

As night overtakes the valley, two owls can be heard hooting just outside of the house. Schaef points them out to Ephaine, stating that there have been a lot more of them recently, which is unusual at this time of year. Ephaine finds it strange. Schaef asks if she thinks it means anything, but Ephaine isn't sure.

Schaef puts his wool cowl on and prepares to head outside. Ephaine casts Guidance on him as he goes, choosing to join him, wary of the threat of meteoric creatures. They find two brown owls sat on the edge of the barn-like structure, stopping their call when the pair approach, eyeing them both up. As Schaef steps closer to get a better look, they both take flight into the night sky.

Ephaine casts Darkvision on both herself and Schaef, catching her father off guard who has never seen so much in the dark before, confirming it was her doing out of surprise. He looks around in awe for a moment before spotting the owls flying eastward towards the mountains. He makes the connection that they are heading in the direction of the [Shrine to the Stars](../places/structures/shrine-to-the-stars.md).

*[Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md):*
> There's too much happening right now that doesn't make a lot of sense. You'll forgive me for saying that your arrival is one of them.

Ephaine asks her father if she should head up there, Schaef suggesting she should look to the stars for answers. Ephaine explains that they are telling her to be cautious today which worries her, but she acquiesces, stating that she will go tonight. Schaef suggests she won't struggle to find the trail with Darkvision, but if the stars are giving her bad omens, maybe she should take her friends. Ephaine agrees, asking Schaef if they would be welcome at the shrine. Schaef is dismissive, telling her that they'll do no harm, and that she shouldn't be surprised at his answer as he is typically accepting of outsiders.

Schaef heads back inside, leaving the door open, allowing Nebula to emerge and sniff around Ephaine's feet before Schaef calls her back inside.

## Heading to the Shrine

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) enters back into the [Seren Farmstead](../places/buildings/houses/seren-farmstead.md), finding the rest of [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md). She asks them to follow her as she has somewhere to show them. Without any resistance the party gather their things and head out into the darkness.

The night sky is clear, the stars incredibly visible this far from the haze of civilisation as a cold evening begins to set in. The party follows Ephaine to the east, ascending the hills to the valley's edge after two hours. She is easily able to locate the foliage at the base of the harsher hills that hides the trail higher, though it takes half an hour to do so in the dark. The party's bemusement at their night time exploration is put aside as the vague semblance of stone steps present themselves as they begin climbing the hill.

After half an hour of ascending a steep hillside, the crest of the hill gives way to a depression between several hills. Nestled between them and out of sight of [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) below is the [Shrine to the Stars](../places/structures/shrine-to-the-stars.md), a set of standing stones amongst loose rock and gravel. The view down into the valley is from a higher point than expected, the scope of their ascent from the Schaef Farmstead only now apparent.

Ephaine recognises the standing stones, with its larger stone set in the centre, two parallel standing stones resting on the ground between them, one shattered long ago into multiple pieces. A small snowdrift can be seen nearby in a depression where the sun never quite hits.

Ephaine asks the party to be quiet and respectful of this place, calling it special. The party agrees to do so.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) tries his best to look at the standing stones in the pitch black conditions. He can't find any carvings that he is looking for, but does observe the weathered and slightly mossy stones, understanding them to be incredibly old. He thinks on the arrangement of the stones but doesn't understand their significance. Ephaine comes over and positions him, pointing to the stones and then the stars, highlighting their alignment. Noon is surprised as he realises their purpose, the entire structure coming into focus.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears next to one of the standing stones, looks at it and then to the stars above, then looks to Noon. She calls it impressive, Noon agreeing mentally. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) lingers for a while, seen by Noon to be slowly pacing the inside of the standing stones, observing them without touching.

Ephaine and Noon feel an arcane draw to the place, making the hairs on her arms stand on end, a very subtle smell of ozone present. The pair note that the sky is the clearest they've ever seen it, the faint wisps of cloud that they saw on their ascent not present any longer. Korina gets a vague sense about the place, recognising that it is sacred.

Ephaine approaches the middle stone, looking up to the stars and opening herself up to them, looking to pull down whatever they are offering to her. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) is seen right next to her, looking up at the stars too, eager to figure out what might happen next.

As Ephaine looks up, she notices the stars twinkling, but perceives them twinkling in rhythm, echoing through her mind like gentle notes on a xylophone. Her eyes are drawn to the archer constellation which feels like it is looking back at her, a subconscious thought without any appearance to back it up. Regardless a slight chill goes down her spine as she realises this. Noon and Korina smell ozone on a slight cold breeze that cuts across them, a sign that something arcane just happened.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> What was that?

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Aren't you supposed to be the one to know these things?

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Yes [Brother Light](../characters/noon-schiller.md), but there are limits to even my knowledge. When I come across those limits, I look for answers.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I can think of no better way to react.

Ephaine involuntary activates Starry Form: Archer, the usual visual appearance of her constellation-covered body and glowing eyes visible to everyone. As it activates, a wash of blue arcane energy flows from the bottom to the top of each standing stone, dissipating from its top once it has nowhere else to go. As this blue shimmer advances, stars can be seen on that part of the rock, which briefly turns to quartz, a clear crystalline appearance with the stars suspended in it. As the blue energy wipes past, the stone returns to plain rock.

As Ephaine enters Starry Form, Noon backs up out of the standing stone, watching silently as the energy rises up each of the standing stones.

Ephaine feels a similar wash of arcane energy rise from her feet to her head, distracting her as she doesn't even notice the standing stones changing.

## Into the Crypt

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) looks around her, spotting a change in the standing stones - a staircase in the intact horizontal standing stone, stone steps carved into it that descend into an unknown place. She doesn't hesitate, heading over to it, placing her feet on the first few steps. From the perspective of the rest of the party, she has just placed her feet through solid stone. Ephaine beckons them with her hand, urging them to follow her.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) heads over and places his hand through the stone, testing the phenomena before standing into it. He checks his hand, finding nothing amiss, tentatively following her deeper. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) follows next, [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) the last to follow.

As soon as everyone's heads cross the apparent horizontal standing stone, they can see what lies beneath - a 10ft wide stone carved staircase that descends into the darkness beyond, no discernible features except for its uniform shape and tool markings from when it was carved. Looking back they can see clearly through the standing stone, a clear view of the starry night sky.

Noon casts Dancing Lights to provide better lightning, overtaking the bright light emitted by Ephaine while in Starry Form. Ahsha asks Ephaine if she can light a torch, Ephaine approving and offering her a Star Mote (Fire Bolt) with her hand, allowing Ahsha to light the torch without fumbling with her tinderbox.

## The Archer Trial

The staircase emerges into a darkened room beyond. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) and [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) gaze into the room beyond, spotting an open chamber with pillars on either side, a view deeper obscured by the 45 degree decline of the staircase and its parallel roof.

Ahsha steps down the stairs to get a better look. As she steps onto the stone slabbed floor beyond the last step, an arcane glyph begins to glow underfoot, a ring of blue arcane symbols illuminating briefly. From an unknown point on the other side of the room, a Guiding Bolt is fired directly at her, piercing her chest with a beam of radiant energy that Ephaine instinctively recognises. Ahsha shouts at Ephaine, blaming her in the moment, but Ephaine denies it, just as surprised as she is. Ephaine checks the area that Ahsha stood on, just catching the remains of the fading glow of the arcane rune under Ahsha's foot.

From her position at the bottom of the stairs and aided by the brief illumination of the Guiding Bolt, Ahsha spots what appears to be a pile of clothes about half way across the room, slightly over to the left hand side, and a stone door on the far side. She shouts back to the party that perhaps a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) should go first in case there are more traps. Ephaine agrees, casting Misty Step to the staircase between the pillars on the right hand side of the room, avoiding touching the floor and shielding herself from potential hidden dangers in the room. Noon casts Mage Armour on himself. Korina tentatively begins stepping down the stairs and casts Healing Word on Ahsha.

Ephaine notices small points of light coming from the stone door on the far side of the room, recognising that they are the stars that make up the archer constellation.

Noon reaches the bottom of the stairs and checks the site of the arcane rune that Ahsha described, but is unable to find anything physical or arcane. Ahsha steps backwards to the stairs, expecting more harm to come to her, but the magical trap has already gone off, and nothing happens.

Ephaine looks upon the far right hand side of the room, seeing the crypt's horizontal insets for the dead, 12 in total, each containing a body. She glimpses decaying leather wrapped around bones of humans, each clasping a short bow across their chest in a ceremonial fashion. Ephaine shouts to the party that this appears to be some sort of catacombs. She casts Detect Magic, feeling two unfamiliar magical presences coming from the middle of the room, in addition to what she would expect to feel:

- Body on the floor covered in leathers (abjuration).
- Circular spot in front of the far stone door (abjuration).
- [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md)' [Schiller Steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe.
- [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md)'s eldritch tome.

Ephaine steps down into the centre of the room, heading over to the body. Ahsha takes her bedroll out of her bag, throwing it onto a section of floor that nobody has stepped on yet, checking for traps. It kicks up dust, the smell of decaying bodies becoming more noticeable. She heads over to her bedroll and collects it back up, Noon and Korina following her into the room.

Ephaine examines the body, looking for signs of who they are or how their life ended here. Their cape is draped over them, making it hard to spot many details, but she observes a human-like skeleton dressed in faded and crumbling cloth fineries with leather belts and buckles keeping everything together. Their attire doesn't match that of the skeletons set into the wall. With Detect Magic she can see a magical outline of the skeleton itself, suggesting the magical effect is on the body. She relays her findings to the party, characterising the body as "magical bones". Noon asks what sort of magic it is, Ephaine relaying a sense of protection rather than pure damage.

Ahsha heads over to the skeleton, standing over it with her greataxe ready, worried that it will leap up and attack the party. In doing so she puts her torch down on the ground, which continues to burn. Noon and Korina step further into the room, staying within the brighter light. Noon then heads past Ahsha to inspect the body for himself, getting a vague arcane feeling of tension from it.

As Ephaine's Starry Form wears off, she notices that the points of light coming from the door fade away, returning it to complete darkness. She heads over to the circular magical aura at the base of the door, keeping her distance. She observes a 2ft diameter circle of blue glowing arcane runes, recognising that it is magical, matching what Ahsha stepped on across the room. She casts Dispel Magic, the blue glowing runes fading immediately, something only she can perceive.

Ephaine approaches the door and checks it over intently, finding no inset, carving, or even tool marks, puzzled by where the points of light were coming from.

Ahsha asks Ephaine what they should try to do, wondering if they should try to break the door down. Ephaine isn't sure. Ahsha offers to kick the body in the middle of the room.

[Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md), taking her time to soak in the room she finds herself in, realises that her fight or flight instincts are bouncing back and forth strongly, a sense of foreboding and dread coming to her through her [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) abilities, sending a shiver down her spine. In contrast Ephaine is irreverent of the room, seeing it as a place of honour and rest with no further danger present.

## The Skeletons Awaken

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) ponder where the body in the middle of the room came from. Ahsha wonders if it came from one of the crypt's insets, so she grabs her torch and heads up the stairs on the right hand side of the room to check for a missing skeleton. As she reaches the top of the stairs, all 12 skeletons on this side of the room stir and begin to emerge from their resting places, the earliest settlers of [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) rising to protect the secrets of the [Devdaha Crypt](../places/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md).

*[Initiative order begins]*

Hearing the sound of mass movement coming from one side of the room, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) casts Bless on her party before activating Starry Form: Archer. The door in front of her begins emitting star-like points of light again. She uses her spectral archer to attack the door, a spectral arrow piercing it for a second before the stone door begins to slide downwards, slowly opening to reveal a darkened corridor beyond. Everyone can hear the sound of stone grinding on stone.

The first skeletons emerge from their inset places on the crypt wall, readying their short bows. Several clamber down into the room's central area beyond the pillars. Two fire at Noon, one hitting. Two more fire at [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md), again only one hits. The rest of the skeletons fire at Ahsha from close range, missing completely.

Ahsha swings her greataxe at the skeletons that have surrounded her, slicing the first clean in half, bones clattering to the floor. She pushes her attack into the skeleton to her right, doing the same to it, the first two skeletons dispatched with ease.

Noon moves to the bottom of the stairs where Ahsha is, casting Eldritch Blast on one of the skeletons that climbed down into the middle of the room. His blast destroys much of its ribcage, but it stands strong, glowing blue eyes glaring back at him. He moves onto the stairs to provide cover from incoming arrows.

[Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) moves to the middle of the room and uses Channel Divinity: Turn the Undead. She raises her fist on which she wears her ring used as a magical focus, shouting loudly:

*[Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md):*
> Undead, go back home!

A flash of radiant light is seen that expands and races across the room, washing over everyone within. The skeletons most affected by this energy are carried away on it with force, their bones losing the magic that animates them instantly, clattering to the floor in piles of bone and decaying cloth. Those that remain are surprised, searching their surroundings for the cause, those with a line of sight on Korina staring right at her. Korina casts Shield of Faith on Noon, expecting more trouble as the opposite side of the room stirs with the sound of skeletons awakening.

Ephaine uses her archer form on the skeleton right in front of her, the prone skeleton that fell from the upper area getting skewered with a spectral arrow, staggering slightly. She follows it up with Star Mote (Fire Bolt), setting its robes on fire, the bones clattering to the floor as its magic fades. She climbs up to the upper section, joining Ahsha on the other side of a skeleton beyond the pillars.

The skeletons on the other side of the room get down from their resting recesses, most emerging into the lower area by jumping from between the pillars, most of which fall prone in the process, the rest making their way down the stairs. Collectively four skeletons loose arrows at Korina, focusing on the source of the radiant energy. Three arrows hit.

Ahsha swings at the skeleton between her and Ephaine. The greataxe lodges in its ribcage, so she spins it in place (critical hit), popping each joint in its spine as bones go flying in Ephaine's direction, the skeleton destroyed. Ahsha makes her way to the remaining skeleton on this side of the room that has been shooting arrows from the corner.

Noon heads to the cleared out side of the room, casting Eldritch Blast between the pillars at the only skeleton he has line of sight on. The first blast pushes it backwards as it knocks another arrow, the second popping its head clean off, destroying it.

Korina moves close to skeletons near to the unknown body on the left hand side of the central area, exhaling her breath weapon onto three skeletons. The cold breath ices up two of them particularly well. Korina watches as the body on the floor tips over, but no effect is triggered. She moves back towards the pillars that Ahsha and Ephaine are beyond, expecting more arrows to impact her any moment.

*[Initiative order paused]*
