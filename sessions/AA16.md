## What Remains of the Hunter

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) begin to calm down having defeated the two [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) that attacked them while hiking through the night. One lies dead nearby, a pile of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) all that remains of its body, while the second fled into the darkness to the south.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) comes down from her rage, checking her surroundings while asking the party what they just fought, but everyone is too stunned or injured to respond. She begins searching for the hunter's remains, [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) supporting her search by casting Dancing Lights. Ahsha is unable to find anything amongst the long grass.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) ponders what these creatures are, wondering if they are arcane in nature. Ahsha asks if they're native to this region but Ephaine is certain they aren't. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) states that she originally thought they were wolves, but clearly not. Ahsha explains the feeling that her [Schiller Steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe seemed to do a fair bit of damage to them. Ahsha thanks Noon for his Dancing Lights, also going out of her way to thank his shadow who she looks around for, not seeing it.

Noon takes a moment to search for the remains himself, stumbling across a pile of dark grey dust that is finer than sand and dry, scattered across the long grass nearby. He points the party over to it. Noon tentatively grabs a handful, observing that it flows between his fingers like sand would, before methodically brushing every grain of it from his hands.

Ahsha suggests the party gets some rest before proceeding. She hears wolves howling to the south, echoing from far away. It is less chatty than usual, sounding more perfunctory. Ahsha wonders if they should search for tracks from here, suggesting [Kiln squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) may have been involved with these creatures. Korina points out that she is unable to see far in the dark, which convinces Ahsha that the best course of action is to sleep now and search when it is light.

| Character(s) | Shift | Observations |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md)<br>[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) | 4h | Uneventful. |
| [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md)<br>[Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) | 4h | Some wolf howling from the southwest. |

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## Searching for Tracks

After sleeping through the early morning, the party rises, ready to search for the tracks. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) uses the moment to investigate the pile of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) for herself, in particular searching for a smell. She finds it odourless, finding its lack of a scent abnormal.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) leads the party in tracking the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md), picking up the trail by retracing the wolf pack's tracks. She observes footprints that are crescent moon shaped, the inside of the moon pointing away from the direction of travel. The gaps between the footprints are large, underlying these creatures' speed.

As she begins following the trail, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) wonders if this is a good spend of their time, noting the timer looming over their [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission ([Rescue Kiln Squad](../storylines/rescue-kiln-squad.md)). Ahsha argues that these creatures may account for [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md)'s disappearance, especially as there is little else going on out in these rural parts. She asks for the party's opinion, seeking a majority vote. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) is supportive. Ephaine is still wary of how much time they'll spend on this, Noon agreeing, suggesting limiting the time they spend on the search. Ahsha compromises, deciding that they'll spend the rest of the day searching.

Ephaine leads the horse while Ahsha leads on, following the tracks as they run vaguely parallel to the valley's trail. Ephaine keeps watch while Ahsha's head is focused down on the tracks. Korina keeps an eye on the party's rear, seeing little. Ephaine notices the first signs of the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) appearing to the northeast, snowcapped mountains visible on the distant hazy horizon. Beyond that, deer can be seen drinking from the stream further ahead and birds can be heard going about their day.

By the afternoon the trail starts to veer west, closer to the trail, the first deviation in the trail so far. As she goes she notices one of the two sets of tracks disappear periodically, assuming that this is where one of the pair teleported. The wolf tracks stay close to the hunters' tracks. As the hunters' tracks begin moving even closer to the trail, the trail ends abruptly, Ahsha convinced that she's not missed anything - the tracks simply end (where the Meteoric Mind first created these [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md)).

The party fans out into the nearby grassy surroundings, but nobody does a good job of searching around, missing traces of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) amongst the grass leading northeast to [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md). As far as they can tell there is nothing untoward about where they are. The grass is undisturbed beyond here, while typically the hunters' tracks were accompanied by disturbed grass as their bodies pushed through the taller foliage.

Stumped, Ahsha asks the party what they should do next. Ephaine is out of ideas.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Well, the trail has gone cold, so the only thing we can do is carry on.

Ahsha agrees, noting that this is something they can ask the [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) locals about upon their arrival. The party picks up the trail again, Ahsha continuing to look for tracks as she goes, not finding any.

## Entering the [Albulain Valley](../places/plains-valleys/albulain-valley.md)

The party reaches the northern extent of [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md), a 500ft wide corridor that forms its narrowest extent where the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) intrude on the valley floor, the trail ahead seen rising into the gap. As they reach this point night begins to fall.

The party camps for the night, wolf howling once again heard to the distant south, signalling the party having survived the land under their influence.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

Proceeding into the narrowest part of the valley, a strong frost from overnight lingers low in the valley, the shadows from close tall hills lingering much longer than in the valley proper, keeping the frost alive that much longer.

By midday the party crests one of many hills along this section, glimpsing the [Albulain Valley](../places/plains-valleys/albulain-valley.md) for the first time, stretching far ahead of them. The clear and crisp day gives sight to the greenery at the bottom of the valley, the land sloping gently down to the west to the lake at its bottom. To the west are jagged arid peaks, contrasted to the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) to the east which retain what little snow has fallen on them already.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) spots familiar stone and thatch farmsteads as well as tiny white spots in groups that she recognises as flocks of sheep grazing.

*[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> Is this where you grew up? Did you grow up around this kind of house and setting?

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> This is exactly where I grew up, actually. This is home.  
> I haven't been back since I had to flee, so I don't really know what's going to greet us here. I don't know what sort of welcome we're going to get.

*[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> How long ago did you have to flee?

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> Well, it was almost three years ago now. When, you know, I had to seek asylum with the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), and, uh... here we are now.

Ahsha hopes Ephaine's welcome home is a warm one and offers help if she needs anything. Ephaine is appreciative of the sentiment.

Ahsha asks Ephaine where they should go, asking if there is a nearby village. Ephaine explains that there is a central village area but otherwise it is mostly spread out farmsteads. She mentions the [Seren Farmstead](../places/buildings/houses/seren-farmstead.md) as an option, wondering if they would all be welcome at home. Otherwise they could head into the middle of the village and stay at the inn there. Ahsha likes the idea of staying with a more known quantity if Ephaine isn't uncomfortable visiting home. Ephaine is fine with going, leading the party down into the valley.
