## Showdown with the Guards

While [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) is squaring off against the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) in the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers, [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) makes her way down the ladder into the sewers, having followed the commotion of guards. She was on [Astorrel guard](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) duty for the [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md) tournament but was bored and looking for more excitement, so followed them to try and see what was going on.

She emerges at the bottom of the ladder, finding 3 [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) confronting [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md), with one other off to the right getting into position with a crossbow. It is immediately clear that the situation is tense.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) is not willing to stop moving forward, playing up her size and muscularity as she gets uncomfortably close to the [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md). [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) tries to appeal to the guards using reason, explaining that they're under direct orders from [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md), and that if they stop the squad, the seriousness of the current situation will come crashing down upon them.

The [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) with their arm out doesn't relent, touching Ahsha's chest. In this moment Korina interjects, using Channel Divinity: Order's Demand to compel the guards:

*[Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md):*
> Oh hey friends. Looks like I'm missing all the fun. I heard some big names being thrown about and I don't think we want any infighting on our hands right now, so if we can just let these nice people through and let their mission continue, I'm sure we can talk about this later.

The [Astornox guard](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) closest to her instinctively turns around in surprise and starts to draw their blade, but they and the [Astornox guard sergeant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) are compelled by Korina's divine magic. The sergeant lowers his arm and scoots in against the wall, allowing [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) space to pass. He concurs with Korina, telling his guards that this is no business of theirs and the squad are allowed to pass. The only guard not affected by Korina's magic looks confused but defers to their superior's command.

[Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) makes their way past the guards. As they come face to face Ahsha thanks Korina but tells here that the squad need to get out of the sewers with their prisoner ([Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md)). The squad notice her [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) badge which surprises them, so they ask her to tag along as backup. Ephaine tells her that they need to get back to Ronvyn.

Korina introduces herself to the group by name. They briefly exchange details of their station. Korina explains that she is stationed in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) while [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) tell her that they are stationed in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). Korina recognises their squad name from the tournament, though she knows nothing about the squad members.

She congratulates them on their performance but laments not being able to see any of their matches. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) steps forward and introduces himself to Korina. Meanwhile the guards begin fanning out to sweep deeper into the sewer.

## Climbing the Ladder

Korina starts to pay attention to Xavier draped over Ahsha's shoulder, realising that he is bound, gagged, and has a hood over his head. She figures that he was the source of the commotion and doesn't inquire.

Ephaine thanks Korina for assisting them but voices her suspicion over her timely appearance. She asks her what she is doing here. Korina explains that she has been on guard duty for the tournament, got bored, and followed the group of [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) causing a commotion. Ahsha downplays her help, confident that [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) could have handled it themselves.

The party start making their way up the ladder. Ahsha goes first followed by Korina. Between the pair is Xavier who they are both muscling up the latter together. Ephaine and then Noon climb after them.

Part way up Ahsha's grip on Xavier loosens. She stiffens her arms but loses her footing on the ladder, causing both her an Xavier to tumble toward Korina. Korina is able to brace both for just long enough for Ahsha to regain their grip on Xavier.

Ahsha makes small talk about [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) not being here. Ephaine comments that she is likely off with [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md).

As Ahsha continues climbing her head enters a section of the ladder that is shrouded in a dry odourless mist, making it hard for her to see even her hand on the ladder. It doesn't bother her so she continues on without mentioning it. As Korina meets the mist she speaks up, voicing a concern over this seemingly unnatural phenomena and how they should proceed cautiously. Ahsha shrugs it off, revealing to Korina nonchalantly that they are working on uncovering a [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spy plot and that time is of the essence. She keeps quiet and continues on with the group.

## [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md)'s Cellar

Ahsha goes to grab the next ladder rung but finds nothing. The mist has now entirely consumed her vision, so she pokes her head up higher to see what's going on. It emerges from the mist, allowing her to see the gently swirling disc of mist on the floor created by the Arcane Gate spell.

She finds herself in a completely different room to where she expected, emerging into a small wood floored room that forms part of an inn's cellar. From here she can see a larger adjoined area filled with large casks of ale. The room is dimly lit by oil lamps.

[Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) emerges around the corner, calmly approaching Ahsha and leaning over to offer her arm:

*[Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md):*
> Oh! You're here, let me help you then.

Ahsha reluctantly accepts, checking unsuccessfully for windows to get her bearings. As Gwenhwyfar pulls her out, Xavier then emerges, causing her to exclaim in surprise that they didn't waste any time. Gwenhwyfar is good spirited and speaks to Ahsha as if they know each other well.

As everyone emerges from the ladder, Ahsha asks Gwenhwyfar politely who she is and where they are. She introduces herself as [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md), catching herself and jovially apologising for not leading with an introduction. She calls herself the "Truthseeker that was requested" which registers with Ephaine and Noon, recalling that [Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md) ordered [Tanin Arnous](../characters/tanin-arnous.md) to fetch one while [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) were in [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) earlier. When asked if the captains sent for her she reveals that Legacy sent for her but that she doesn't work for him.

Ephaine has no time for this, telling [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) that they need to get their prisoner back to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) as requested. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) tells them that "funnily enough" they are already in the right place and that she is the person they need to bring their prisoner to. Ephaine senses a half truth beyond a visage of saccharine kindness that betrays a different non-hostile intent.

[Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) asks if this is one of the spies that [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) had reported. They confirm and mention that another got away, which [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) voices her sadness over. She asks Ahsha to set Xavier down against one of the giant casks. She complies but keeps herself between Xavier and [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) defensively. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) picks up on this and dismisses her actions, telling Ahsha that she only wants to learn what he is doing here, in his own words.

Ahsha once again asks if [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) is privy to what is going on here. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md)'s demeanour shifts as her façade begins to wane due to her tiredness that the group isn't complying the way she wants them to. She appeals to the group plainly, telling them that while she appreciates their orders, she has her own and in fact sits higher up the chain than Ronvyn. Ephaine retorts that if she is [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) she has no jurisdiction over them, unless she happens to be [Astornar](../organisations/government/astornar.md). [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) confirms as much by producing an [Astornar](../organisations/government/astornar.md) general's military badge from her pocket.

The group immediately loosens up and apologise, knowing their place. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) forgives them, trying her best to remove the tension from the room by suggesting they take this encounter one step at a time.

## Covering Up the Plot

Ahsha pulls the hood from over Xavier's head, revealing to Korina an elf with a rope gag in his mouth. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) gets down on one knee in front of him and stares directly into his eyes, speaking in [elvish](../languages/elvish.md) to him. Only Ephaine recognises what she says:

*[Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md):*
> This will go a lot easier for you if you cooperate.

Xavier nods in agreement. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) then places a hand with her palm outstretched near his head, a turquoise blue glow of magical energy emanating from it as she casts Detect Thoughts on him, reading his memories in the process. His eyes glow turquoise for a few moments while this happens. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) pushes deep, gaining not only his thoughts but his memories, including of his time in the sewers with [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md). Once done she stands up and faces the group, no longer acknowledging Xavier.

*[Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md):*
> Right then, so what did they tell you?

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) truthfully recants what Xavier told them - that he and [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) were in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) to observe the [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md) tournament, specifically [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md), who in their culture is referred to as an [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md). [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) remarks that she doesn't know what that is, lying following her newly gained memories. Noon goes on to tell [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) that Allisa is one herself and that she "no longer wants to be alone".

[Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) stifles a wry grin that only Ephaine notices. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) probes deeper, causing Ephaine to name drop [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) and Castien Raloven. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) expresses how she finds all of this interesting before quizzing [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) on who she is, to which she replies that she is an [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) stationed in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) and that this is a "right place, right time" situation, though [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) feels it is the opposite.

[Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) summarises her feelings to the party:

*[Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md):*
> So I'll be honest with you all. I'm a little disappointed with how much you know, and it's making this a bit complicated for me. Because I'm not a fan of loose ends.

[Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) turns to [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md) and casts Disintegrate, a laser sharp beam of green light shooting him in the chest from her index finger. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) tries to grab her hand and move it out of the way, but she grabs it too late. The beam impacts Xavier's chest, turning his entire being into dust which is violently scattered across the floor and cask behind him. Xavier is dead.

The moment utterly shocks everyone in the room as Ephaine and Noon react strongly to the notion of a prisoner being executed in front of them. Ephaine expresses her disbelief by telling [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) that she hopes that [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) got everything she wanted from him, and then sheepishly suggesting that their business is concluded and they are free to leave, surely?

Ahsha has hold of [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md)'s hand. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) tries to pull away but Ahsha's grip is too strong, so instead [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) casts Misty Step, disappearing from in front of Ahsha and appearing across the room. She raises her arm toward the party, palm open and fingers outstretched.

*[Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md):*
> Let's not do anything too rash now, okay? You're *not* free to go.

[Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md)'s voice betrays her sudden nervousness as although she outclasses the party, she is nonetheless outnumbered. Ahsha points out the hypocrisy in what she just said but [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) reiterates the need to tidy up loose ends, a chilling statement.

Now with everyone's attention, [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) tells the party that she will dictate what happens next. Ahsha stubbornly suggests that she "bring them in" as they already know too much. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) expresses the complication of this fact before offering the party two options: the first being silence, the second being death.

She explains the narrative to be imposed upon the party. There were never any spies in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) or anywhere within the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), and so instead of looking for them today, the party were enjoying the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) hammers home the importance of there being no spies - if spies existed, that would be a breach of the [Astor-Syntenne War](../history/events/astor-syntenne-war.md) armistice agreement, and she is trying to avoid a return to war at all costs.

Ephaine challenges the notion of brushing all of this under the rug, suggesting that the presence of spies means that the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) should defend itself. Noon gives [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) no chance to respond, playing to [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md)'s narrative and acting as if the spies don't exist, questioning their existence:

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Right. What spy?

He uses Awakened Mind to telepathically communicate with the party, telling them that now is not the time and that they should pick their battles carefully. Ephaine voices her respect and compliance for the chain of command, making it clear that they will follow her orders, and that they will pretend as if they spent the day at the festival. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) compliments the festival, making it clear that it would not be possible if the kingdom was at war.

Ahsha struggles with the layered context of the conversations but follows the lead of Ephaine and Noon. Ephaine is terrified of the situation and struggling not to show it. Korina weaves her own story of not finding anything of interest here before returning to her guard post.

Ahsha says "see you later", to which [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) retorts that she hopes not. She casts Arcane Gate again, her eyes glowing turquoise and her hands emanating a similar glow, opening another swirling mist portal on the wall, explaining that it leads to the room behind the blue door at the top of the sewer ladder. The party isn't particularly trusting of the portal but see no other choice, heading through one by one.

## A Sombre Aftermath

As promised the party exit the portal into the inside of the building façade behind the blue door. Silence falls over the group as they are still in shock and unable to consider what to do next. Their entire plan was just pulled out from underneath them.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears, leaning against one of the walls. She observes Noon pacing the room but initially remains silent. Noon uses Awakened Mind to speak with her:

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Any ideas [Sister Shadow](../characters/nills.md)?

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Well [Brother Light](../characters/noon-schiller.md), I think this one is even beyond me.

Noon audibly tuts out of frustrated dissatisfaction.

Ephaine says she is feeling tired and wishes to go to bed. Ahsha wonders if they should go back to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) to see what else they can do, but Ephaine insists that this is now out of their hands. Ephaine apologises to Korina for getting her involved.

Noon opens the door revealing the setting sun. Due to the deflated mood the party decides to wrap up their days. Korina heads back to her post, saying goodbye. Ephaine once again expresses how it was a shame they didn't meet under better circumstances.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) heads back to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) to watch the tournament final. Noon returns to the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md) to freshen up before joining her. Ephaine excuses herself back to the stronghold for the night, pouring over her star chart searching fruitlessly for answers about today's events.

## [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md) Tournament Final

*See: [PR26](PR26.md)*

On the way to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) Noon once again sees [Nills](../characters/nills.md), blending into the crowd of festival goers, with a grin on her face. She speaks to Noon before immediately disappearing:

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Oh! Were you planning on going to see that poor boy and make him piss his pants again?

Ahsha and Noon attend the final between [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Komodo squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md), entering the arena via the side entrance but not finding any prominent people hanging around. They make their way out into the stand and watch the match as spectators.

The pair observe [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) use Radiant Soul to sprout radiant wings and fly around the arena, confirming what [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) and [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md) were wishing to observe. Despite this [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) are defeated by [Komodo squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md).

## Acquiring [Schiller Steel](../items/schiller-steel.md)

Following the final Ahsha heads back to the stronghold. Noon wishes her goodbye before peeling off to return to [Schiller Steel Eskrigg](../places/buildings/shops/schiller-steel-eskrigg.md). On arrival he finds a "closed" sign but there is a light source within.

Noon knocks firmly on the door, catching the attention of [Callum Briar](../characters/callum-briar.md) who hurriedly opens the unlocked door, still scared of Noon. Noon tells him that he is here for the greataxe that was set aside for him. Callum pulls it back out from behind the counter, Noon then inspects it.

When Callum asks if Noon has since acquired the cost of the greataxe, he confidently states that payment won't be necessary. Callum reminds Noon that they've had this conversation once before, then pleads that Noon doesn't take it. Noon is offended at the suggestion that he isn't being respectful, claiming that Callum is lucky that Noon doesn't take his skin.

Callum begins to sob, pleading that Noon doesn't do this to him. Noon belittles him, stating his superiority and making sure that Callum knows his place. Callum crumbles, stating that he will go into the back and turn a blind eye, not able to face the situation head-on. Noon gives him a disgusted look while grabbing the [Schiller Steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) begins to form as smoke that curls around the curtain leading to the back room, swirling around it before forming into her typical Noon-like form. She leans on the counter and grins at Noon.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> [Brother light](../characters/noon-schiller.md), do you think father will take his life, or will he will do it to himself first? Place your bets!

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> To be honest dear sister, after today I neither know nor care.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) chuckles.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Well answered.

As [Nills](../characters/nills.md) disappears into a cloud of diffusing smoke, some of it gently drifts toward the [Schiller Steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe. It dissipates all the same before reaching it, but Noon notices the attraction.

Noon makes his way back to the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md) with the axe, using Mage Hand to assist with carrying it. Before going to bed he places the axe amongst Ahsha's belongings in the room she is bunking in.

*[Long rest]*

## Time to Head Home

Ahsha wakes in the morning to find the [Schiller Steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe, surprised by its presence but pleasantly surprised. She wastes no time incorporating it into her supplies.

On arriving downstairs for breakfast she finds Noon and immediately picks him up from the ground, hugging him in thanks, expressing gratitude and blissful ignorance as to how he got it. Noon does his best to hide his discomfort but accepts the hug.

[Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) stumbles into the room from outside of the stronghold, visibly still drunk. She gives an aloof greeting to the table. When Ephaine asks where she has been, Redwyn tells them she spent the day with [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) but gives no deeper explanation. When Redwyn returns the question, Ephaine talks over Ahsha talking about exploring the sewers to explain that the rest of the party enjoyed the festival. Noon backs her up.

Ephaine is concerned that Redwyn is too drunk to deal with higher ups on their return journey courtesy of [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md), casting Lesser Restoration on her to remove her inebriation. She bemoans Ephaine killing her buzz.

Before long [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) meets up with [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) who teleports the party back to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

## Reporting Back to Bryce

Upon their return [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) heads straight to [Bryce Morton's Office](../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md). [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) tells them to take a few days off before returning to him, noting that the previously offered mission in [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md) is still available. The party takes some nondescript downtime.

*[Long rest]*

The next day [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md), and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) are walking through the stronghold when an [Astorrel member](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) approaches them, telling them that [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) wishes to see them immediately. They waste no time heading back to his office.

Knocking on the door, Bryce lets them in himself, eager to welcome them in. Once all three are in he closes the door behind them before returning to his desk, leaning on his elbows in his usual manner.

He is incredibly to the point with the party, telling them that he doesn't know what they did in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) and feels he shouldn't know. He tells them that he has been asked to make a few changes, before stopping himself and telling them of an incoming "shit sandwich" (positive, negative, positive).

First he pulls four heavy bags of coin from his desk, setting them down on its surface. He tells the party that "the higher ups" insisted they have these, noting that each bag contains 100 gp. When Ephaine questions what the money is for, Bryce reiterates his desire not to know, explaining that these orders came from higher up than his rank provides visibility to. His nervousness is palpable. Each of the trio takes a bag.

At this point [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) knocks at Bryce's door before Bryce lets her in. The rest of the party recognise her, remarking that they met her at the festival (playing to [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md)'s story). Korina arrived that day from [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) by teleportation circle, reassigned to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) but with no other clue what is going on. The stronghold is completely unfamiliar to her, so she has been following directions up until this point. She is happy to see familiar faces.

Bryce tells the room that he has only just learned that they all know each other. Bryce and Korina formally introduce themselves to each other before Bryce explains that she has been reassigned to [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md). Ephaine questions the squad's 5 member count, to which Bryce informs them that [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) has been reassigned out to make space for Korina. When Ephaine expresses concern that this has happened twice now, Bryce reassures them that an amount of reshuffling is normal in new [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads.

Bryce also informs the squad that this decision was not his - another order from higher up the chain.

## An Urgent Mission

[Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) tells [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) that they've been summoned here to begin an important mission ([Rescue Kiln Squad](../storylines/rescue-kiln-squad.md)). [Kiln squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) began a mission 50 days ago and have passed their deadline, to the point where the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) are worried for their safety. The call went out for an [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad between missions, to which Bryce suggested [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) to [Samantha Ilis](../characters/samantha-ilis.md).

Bryce thinks the mission will be good for the squad, particularly as the mysterious nature of the orders from higher up the command chain has him worried to the point of suggesting that the squad's time away from [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) will be for the best right now. He reiterates not wanting to know what happened. Ephaine mutters that he might need to know, but Bryce doesn't hear her.

After seeing it on her way in, Bryce can no longer not acknowledge Ahsha's [Schiller steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe, excusing himself as he slips out of his regular [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) demeanour for a moment, gushing over how lucky Ahsha is to have [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) as a compatriot. He goes one step further, asking Noon if it would be possible to talk at a later time about getting a [Schiller steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) weapon into his personal collection. Noon gives a fairly non-committal affirmation.

Congratulating Ahsha on her new weapon, Bryce then goes one step further by congratulating her on her promotion to [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md). He pulls the associated military badge from his desk, replacing the one pinned to her chest in a ceremonial manner.

*[Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md):*

> Looks good on you.

He shares his confidence in Ahsha but tempers it by explaining that he would have preferred to continue evaluating each [Astorrel squad hand](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md), but the decision was taken out of his hands by higher ups. Ephaine congratulates her.

Bryce gets Ahsha to lay her [Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md) on his desk. He uses it as a visual aid while explaining their mission to them.

Bryce explains that [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) are based out of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) but fall under the Major of Phenomena, [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md). Their mission was to conduct wildlife research on the notoriously uninhabited Neum Flats, a kind of frontier mission that also falls under the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s jurisdiction. They have not been seen since they left [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) 50 days ago.

Ahsha asks how long it might take to get there. Bryce makes a rough measurement across the map, indicating an estimate of 8 to 10 days. She then asks if due to the urgent nature of the mission it would be possible to travel via teleportation circle. Bryce informs her that [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) needs a break after frequent travel between [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) and [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md).

Bryce reads the paper in front of him, detailing [Kiln squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md):

| Character | Pronouns | Race | Age / Height | Appearance | Class | Gear | Personality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) | he/him | Tabaxi | 35 / 6'4" | Sandy yellow fur, yellow eyes. | Fighter | Splint armour, two swords | Annoying trivia buff but very capable. |
| [Cherish Loweswater](../characters/cherish-loweswater.md) | she/her | Tiefling | 25 / 5'6" | Tanned skin, blue eyes, blonde hair. Ram's horns | Bard | Leathers, dagger, guitar. | Sweet and protective. |
| [Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md) | he/him | Halfling | 28 / 3'2" | Dark skin, brown eyes, short light brown hair. | Druid | Hemp dress, wooden staff. | Quiet and reserved. In animal form often. Deaf. |
| [Gillian Close](../characters/gillian-close.md) | she/her | Human | 56 / 5'8" | Fair skin, brown eyes, long brown hair. | Cleric | Half plate, maul. | Cheeky, a risk taker, decisive. |

Bryce also informs the squad that their [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md), [Taza Finetrick](../characters/taza-finetrick.md), can be found here in the stronghold in [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) if they wish to know more about the squad members.

Noting the 28 day time limit, Bryce tells [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) that if they don't return themselves, no rescue party will be sent for [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md)'s rescue party. He notes that Ahsha's ideal travel time calculations may be off as the weather is starting to get colder and so [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) will become harder to traverse. Ephaine knows this all too well, agreeing immediately.

Informing the party of a 200 gp bounty per each living [Kiln squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) member they bring back, Ephaine questions what will happen if they come across dead members. Bryce asks for knowledge of their deaths and their [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md) if nothing else.

Ahsha formally accepts the mission. Bryce gives them a head start, informing her that their mission clock will start tomorrow.

## Leaving [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md)

The party makes preparations for the journey ahead, using the rest of the day to buy supplies and arrange transport.

### Transport

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) tries to find [Clay Mullen](../characters/clay-mullen.md) for their outward journey, wanting to travel with a familiar face. She succeeds at finding him outside of the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) eastern gate at the stable. He is wary of her, expecting another journey into uncharted regions. When Ahsha tells him that they wish to travel to the Neum Flats, Clay expresses his disbelief and refuses. He offers a compromise: he will take them as far as [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) or [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) but no further, so the party will have to arrange other transport from there on.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) suggests the party simply buys their own wagon, for convenience and as a travel cost investment. It would also allow them to go wherever they need, not bound by the places carts and coaches are willing to take them. Ephaine points out her familiarity with beasts of burden and that she would be fine steering the wagon herself.

Everyone agrees and chips in equally for the purchase of a wagon, two horses, and all the starting supplies.

| Item | Price |
| --- | ---:|
| Wagon | - 35 gp |
| Horse, draft x2 | - 100 gp |
| Bit and bridle x2 | - 2 gp |

## Heading East

*[Long rest]*

On the first day of their mission, [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) loads up into their new wagon and heads north until they reach the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md), then west towards [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) steers while [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) sits up front and keeps watch. At Ahsha's instruction Ephaine makes the horse gallop at a fast pace.

They pass over the grand stone bridge across the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), a celebrated architectural project that connects the east and west of the kingdom together. The road is busy, as to be expected of an arterial road of this kind. At the pace they are going they almost reach the [River Carn](../places/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) by the end of their first day.

Camping at the roadside overnight, [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) takes first watch, [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) takes second watch, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) takes third watch. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) who is unable to sleep due to [Nilliski](../characters/nilliski.md)'s power stays awake with Ephaine and Noon. Ephaine hears owls hooting in the distance during her night watch.

*[Long rest]*

Resuming the next day, Ephaine proceeds at a more normal pace, not wishing to tire their new horses so soon into the squad's journey. They cross a less grand cobbled stone bridge across the [River Carn](../places/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) and pass the trail up to Carnmere, continuing to follow the main road diligently.

## Griffons on the Road

By the start of sunset, [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) are traversing a part of the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) that navigates a hillier area, the road cut between the hills as best as possible. 30 ft ahead they see an overturned cart, boxes strewn across the road. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) pulls on the reins to slow the wagon, felt by [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) in the back.

Ephaine hears the sound of [Ulfric Sander](../characters/ulfric-sander.md) shouting for help from the overturned cart while a griffon can be heard screeching periodically from out of sight, a wing occasionally seen from behind a tree. It appears the griffon is watching over the cart from a ledge.

*[Ulfric Sander](../characters/ulfric-sander.md):*

> Help we're stuck! Help it's going to get us! Help it's still here!

Ephaine informs the rest of the party before hopping out of the cart and making her way forward stealthily. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) hops out of the front and confidently makes her way up the road towards the cart, not bothered about being seen. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) hops out and follows Ahsha, while [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) remains in the back of the cart, keeping watch.

While sneaking forward, Ephaine steps on a branch and snaps it, eliciting a danger call from the griffon. Ahsha speaks to Ulfric who begins to panic, begging for help. Ahsha pulls her greataxe out and readies for battle with the beast.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Ephaine casts Bless on her squad mates, activates her Starry Form (Archer), steps around the tree and catches a glimpse of the griffon. Wasting no time her spectral archer looses a spectral arrow at the griffon, wounding it.

Two more unsighted griffons enter the fray. The original griffon flies straight to Ephaine, missing her with its beak but digging into her side with its claws. A second griffon joins it, striking with a critical hit with its beak, before also striking her with its claws. The third griffon swoops in towards Ahsha but critically misses, slamming its beak into the ground and kicking up gravel from the road.

Korina attempts to cast Word of Radiance on one of the griffons but it resists the effect. She then casts Healing Word on Ephaine. Noon leaps from the wagon and casts Dissonant Whispers at one of the griffons attacking Ephaine, causing it to flee involuntarily. Ephaine slices it with her dagger as it turns and flies off.

Ahsha swings around the griffon attacking her, putting it between herself and Korina, slicing at it, christening her [Schiller steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe. Ephaine casts Misty Step to join Ahsha and Korina before casting Guiding Bolt at the griffon she teleported away from. The bolt doesn't connect well, dealing minimal damage.

The griffon Ahsha and Korina have surrounded attacks Ahsha again, once again critically missing with its beak, allowing Ahsha to get her greataxe handle into its mouth and deal it some minor bludgeoning damage. The two other griffons begin diving toward Noon, the first of which misses Noon with its beak and strikes the wagon before hitting him with its claws.

Korina runs to Noon's aid, causing the griffon in front of her to try and swipe at her with its claws, but for the third time it misses critically. Korina uses her dragon breath to breathe cold onto both griffons accosting Noon before casting Shield of Faith on Noon.

Noon circles around the griffon closest to him, putting himself between both griffons. He casts Eldritch Blast at the wounded one that he moved closest to, blasting it with two beams. It falls from the sky, digging into the road right before the wagon.

Ahsha continues her rage on the griffon in front of her, slashing down on its back. She uses Action Surge to hit it a second time, collapsing its right rear leg muscles, putting it dangerously close to death. Ephaine casts Guiding Bolt and Starry Form: Archer at the second griffon next to Noon, weakening it severely.

Ahsha's griffon doubles down and attacks her again, critically missing (fourth nat 1 ) with its beak. It sees the writing on the wall and begins to flee across the grassy ridges above the road. Ephaine slices it with her dagger as it goes. The other griffon sees this and disengages, flying off in the same direction.

As the griffons flee, Korina casts Healing Word on Ephaine while Noon casts Eldritch Blast on his griffon, sniping it with three successful hits as it flies off, killing it and dropping it from the sky, cackling manically as he revels in the power trip.

Ahsha rushes over to the overturned cart to help the couple trapped within. She sees [Selene Sander](../characters/selene-sander.md) who also pleads for help. Ahsha helps to lift the disintegrated cart pieces from her so that she can crawl out from under it.

*[Initiative order ends]*
