## The Morning After

*[Everyone: long rest]*

Having gone to bed not long after dispatching the axe beaks last night, everyone begins to wake after a restful evening on the roadside.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) wakes first, pulling out their lute and playing a tune that quickly cuts through everyone else's sleep. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) in particular are woken up immediately, complaining in their own ways about the early morning noise.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) wakes up and sizes up the axe beak corpses, not noticing that two of them have flies swarming around them. When he sizes one up for breakfast meat, Marik stops him, advising him that it's not safe to eat.

Valan shouts at Vētrall for the rude wake up. The pair descend into shouting at each other, Valan furious at Vētrall's audacity and tendency for playing music, while Vētrall calls Valan ungrateful and miserable. Vētrall wished to teach Valan a morning lesson about tree climbing but doesn't see a sufficiently high tree in the immediate vicinity and decides better of it.

While the pair are arguing loudly, the coach driver catches their attention, asking if the party will be departing soon. He has packed up his sleeping back from the roof of the coach and prepared the horses. The party quickly packs up their belongings and enter the coach.

Once underway, it becomes clear to Kera and Vētrall that [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) is being uncharacteristically quiet this morning. They quiz him after some time, noting that his voice sounds rough. He brushes off their concern, responding to their questioning of what's up with lamentation of not being in a town or city. When asked why, he explains that he enjoys the company of varied people and their stories, something that is easy to come by in an urban centre. Valan contrasts with Nainarv's preference, noting that he prefers the simplicity of life in the wilderness.

For the rest of the morning and into the early afternoon, the coach proceeds without incident towards [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md), arriving there not long after midday. As the party look out of the window they see the outskirts of [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) as buildings and urban sprawl become more common. Kera sticks his tongue out of the window to get any fresh air he can, still not coping well with enclosed transport.

## Arriving in [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md)

As the coach works its way towards the [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) city centre, the party discuss their plans while in the [Nilus Coast](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/nilus-coast.md) capital. Almost everyone has shopping needs, so that becomes the agreed first order of business. [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) is happy to tag along, no specific business of his own to attend to.

The coach pulls into a large stable building designed to accommodate carts and coaches, with a large interior stable space. The coach driver is directed into a stall, after which he opens the doors and announces that they have arrived. He thanks the party for their patronage and shows them to the pedestrian exit from the stables, noting that if they return tomorrow he will be once again looking for customers. The party wishes him well before exiting into the busy boulevard-like street, bustling with traders and citizens of all kinds.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) puts up her hood before pulling [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) to one side while the rest of the party try to figure out where to go next. She impresses upon her unhappiness at being back in [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) due to their [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) bounty, noting that they aren't likely to be safe here. She asks Kera to keep a low profile, but he points out his minotaur lineage and height will make it hard to remain inconspicuous. The pair resolve to keep their eyes out and be careful.

## Starting with Shopping

The party begins their time in [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) by taking care of some shopping errands.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) finds an upmarket clothing shop that has ball gowns in its front window and upper class clothing within. Not needing to buy a full outfit, they merely buy a dress shirt for 2 gp. This attracts a sneer from the owner as Vētrall buys the cheapest item in the shop despite the owner expecting an incoming large purchase, based on Vētrall's look.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) finds a weaponsmith, looking to sell his warhammer as he prefers his [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) greatsword. The warhammer is in a state of disrepair, so the owner will only play for its value as scrap metal - 7 sp. Kera is understanding and accepts.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) searches for a magic shop in which to sell her spell scroll and Potion of Diminution, but is unable to find one anywhere in the city centre.

While walking the streets with the party, Marik notices [Lonearm](../characters/lonearm.md) slowly walking down the boulevard, with [Juror](../characters/juror.md) in tow, both wearing affluent attire. [Lonearm](../characters/lonearm.md) sports a cane and is taking his time, while [Juror](../characters/juror.md) is shadowing him close behind. [Juror](../characters/juror.md) glances at Marik and Kera, unsighted by the party, before following his wealthy patron into the next street.

[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) searches for a shop that might sell him magical arrows for his bow. He finds [Arm of the Coast](../places/buildings/shops/arm-of-the-coast.md), proceeding inside with the party. He finds a small selection of long and short bows, recognising their inferior quality. Most of the shop is full of crossbows of all kinds, with barrels of crossbow bolts strewn around the room. He asks the shopkeeper [Erelmil Yraudhen](../characters/erelmil-yraudhen.md) if they stock magical arrows, but unfortunately they don't. Erelmil points Valan to [Raphael's Armaments](../places/buildings/shops/raphaels-armaments.md) in [Hochwald](../places/settlements/cities/hochwald.md), the only store he knows that may sell such wares.

## Summoned to [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md)

While the party is inside [Arm of the Coast](../places/buildings/shops/arm-of-the-coast.md), [Juror](../characters/juror.md) enters, much to the surprise of [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md). He briefly browses a display of daggers affixed to the wall before sliding a closed barrel of bolts over to the display to gain the necessary height to retrieve his preferred dagger. He sheepishly slides the barrel back, embarrassed by the noise and spectacle of a vertically challenged goblin. [Juror](../characters/juror.md) makes his way to the counter, quietly paying [Erelmil Yraudhen](../characters/erelmil-yraudhen.md) the asking price for the dagger.

On his way out, [Juror](../characters/juror.md) passes by Marik. He places a room key for [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md) into her hand, and whispers to her discreetly:

*[Juror](../characters/juror.md):*
> [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) will see you both now.

Without stopping [Juror](../characters/juror.md) exits the store, disappearing into the street.

Marik keeps quiet initially, but once outside she confides in [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and then the group that the goblin approached her with a key, pointedly saying that they have been summoned to speak with [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md), worrying both Marik and Kera. Neither recognise the key specifically, but Marik can tell it is a room key, so intuits that it must be for a place they have been before - [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md). She shares this with the party, telling them that they should make their way there.

The party heads down the boulevards in the direction of the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md).

## News of [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md)

When rounding the corner onto the boulevard that has the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) and [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md) at its far end, the party notice a town crier standing atop a large upturned bucket, reading news for the day:

*Town crier:*
> [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) falls to the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md)!  
> After a sabotage plot was thwarted, Kavallos ships broke the sea defences and bombarded the [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md) settlement. Evacuation back to Lorignac is underway. The Alliance Senate will meet to discuss retaliation plans!

> King Garridan II of [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) and Lady Helene renew their vows!  
> On the 20th anniversary of their marriage, the royal couple professed their undying love for each other and their faith in the people of [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md).  
> May they share many more happy years together!

The entire party is immediately shocked by the news which contradicts their belief that they saved [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) from the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md). [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) recalls that two of the four coastal defence cannons were destroyed in the night attack, so perhaps they were simply overwhelmed, particularly if all of the Kavallos soldiers were dispatched and no word was given to the warships to abort their attack plans.

[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) laughs at the news, thrilled that [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md)'s stewardship of the town has gone poorly. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) is concerned for the arch-mage, wondering what's become of her in the evacuation. Marik wonders if [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) got away safely.

## Returning to [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md)

The party make their way along the boulevard, passing in front of the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md), where they all first met. To its right at the end of the street is [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md).

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) surveys the area, with sharp eyes noticing a figure in the room that her and [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) occupied while staking out the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md). While she can't identify them, she does see them looking at her before diving below the window sill as soon as they are noticed.

Marik moves to the back alley to the right of the boulevard's end, ushering the rest of the party to join her. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), who are on their way to enter the inn, take a moment to realise what is going on, but join Marik.

Here Marik tells the party that the inn is a dangerous place, if indeed this is where the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) want to meet with her and Kera. Collectively they discuss how they will approach the situation. Vētrall offers to go to the room with the pair, but Marik suggests that it is a bad idea - they should go in alone. Vētrall compromises, offering to buy the room next door from which they can sound the alarm if the situation turns dangerous. The party agree to use the code words "cheese sandwich" to sound the alarm.

The party head into [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md). Kera buys an ale, as does [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) who remains at the bar throughout the party's time here.

Marik chooses to head straight up to the room, not wishing to ask the innkeeper about the key, but Vētrall stops her. They buy their own room for the night near the room number on the key, claiming that their friends are already staying in that room and they wish to be close by. The innkeeper obliges, selling Vētrall a room two doors down. With the key in hand, Marik can see that the key given to her is identical in design, confirming her theory that this is the place they are to meet.

Vētrall and Valan head upstairs to their room. Marik and Kera wait a moment before heading up to the room the key belongs to. Marik unlocks the door and heads inside, Kera right behind her.

## [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md)'s Ultimatum

Inside the room they find [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md), stood next to the bed, hands by her hips, giving the pair an intense look. Kera closes the door behind him.

*[Crucible](../characters/crucible.md):*
> Lock the door and give me the key, now.

[Crucible](../characters/crucible.md)'s words are direct and firm, underlying the seriousness of their meeting and the tone of the conversation to come. Marik flatly says no, refusing to do as she is told. [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) responds by drawing two daggers from her side.

*[Crucible](../characters/crucible.md):*
> I won't ask again. Lock the door and give me the key, or you'll both be leaving this room in a body bag.

Marik, sensing that [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md)'s threat is real, begins trying to explain their situation in order to diffuse tensions. She explains that they are tracking their mark and have not given up on their mission. [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) retorts that she is more concerned about their sudden disappearance from the street in front of the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md), evading her "eyes and ears".

*[Crucible](../characters/crucible.md):*
> What is most troubling is your disappearance. Literally. My eyes and ears relayed to me that the four of you vanished from the streets while squabbling amongst yourselves.

[Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) once again implores Marik to lock the door, as the time for lenience is quickly passing. Marik finally buckles, locking the door, but keeping the key for herself. [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) gives her a strong judgmental look but accepts her compromise, keeping her daggers out and at the ready.

[Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) makes her position very clear to the pair. They are to retrieve from [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) whatever was taken from the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) that day by [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), within the next week, and return it to her. In the mean time she will not lift the 5,000 gp bounty from each of their heads, and if they are not successful within the given time, she will personally hunt them herself.

Marik is frustrated, asking [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) how she intends for them to succeed if the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) pose a danger to their mission. [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) gives a wry grin, savouring the moment before answering. She doesn't necessarily expect them to succeed, as the odds are stacked against them, but encourages the pair to surprise her.

Marik assures [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) that they will succeed and on time. They have gained the trust of their targets and believe them to be carrying something "better than the sword", which catches [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md)'s curiosity. She hopes they are right.

With nothing more to say, [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) waves one of her daggers in the direction of the door. Marik wastes no time retrieving the room key, opening the door and backing out slowly, never turning away from [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md). Kera follows suit, closing the door behind him. All the while [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) stands there, glaring at the pair, daggers at the ready.

## Ultimatum Aftermath

While the meeting is taking place, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) listen from two rooms over, but through an entire room they are unable to hear any details other than the sound of the door opening and closing.

As Marik and Kera leave the room, they head back down to the bar immediately. Valan hears this, so after a few moments he leaves their room, following them downstairs. By the time he arrives, the pair are stood at the bar with [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md), contemplating their meeting with [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) and what they should do next.

Vētrall remains in the room, expecting Valan's swift return. After a few minutes in which he doesn't return, Vētrall impatiently heads downstairs to see what is going on, finding the rest of the party at the bar.

The party orders more drinks and take a table near the front of the bar. Here Marik and Kera detail what just happened. They are forthright and honest about what [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) said to them, noting in particular that they have a week to provide [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) with something or she would hunt them personally, and that she knows Vētrall and Valan's full names.

Kera tells the party that Marik promised something better than [Mémoire de Unevaire](../items/echneshment/weapons/memoire-de-unevaire.md), eliciting a frustrated sigh from Vētrall who chastises Marik for making their task harder than it needed to be. Marik asks if Vētrall knows where [Mémoire de Unevaire](../items/echneshment/weapons/memoire-de-unevaire.md) is. Vētrall explains that one of the Vulpes family will have inherited it following [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s death, but they don't know who.

The party discuss what the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) could give [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md). Marik suggests just giving her [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md), making the artifact her problem, and likely bringing the misfortune that follows the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) to the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md). They could wash their hands of the entire situation. Vētrall is opposed to the idea, wanting to figure out what it is or does.

Marik instead suggests presenting [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) with her spell scroll, which she shows the party. Vētrall and Valan recognise arcane runes on the parchment, with only Vētrall understanding that the complexity of the runes suggests that the spell is powerful and commands a high price. Kera doesn't believe that the scroll will be enough to appease [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) now, but even if they do intend to give it to her, giving it to her now will look too suspicious.

The party considers their continued intent to go to [Hochwald](../places/settlements/cities/hochwald.md) to meet with [Disanz Brickbrow](../characters/disanz-brickbrow.md) in [Hochwald](../places/settlements/cities/hochwald.md), who might be able to help them find [Raine Soulier](../characters/raine-soulier.md). The party decides that as the journey to [Hochwald](../places/settlements/cities/hochwald.md) will take 3 of 4 days, they will wait until they arrive in the [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) capital before handing something over to the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md), giving them enough time to decide exactly what that will be.

## An Evening in the City

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) head back out into the streets of [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) to search for more information about what happened to [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md).

Asking the various traders coming and going from one of the large indoor market halls, the pair are able to learn a bit more information. The following morning the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) attacked with four ships and laid waste to the coastal defences before overrunning the town. An unknown number of people were killed in the attack, but loss of life has been confirmed. A hurried evacuation occurred to the north, back towards Lorignac.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) spends the rest of the day keeping an eye out for would-be Marsh Skimmer assassins, but sees none. She also returns to the room that [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) was in, finding it empty and immaculate, with no sign that anyone has so much as sat on the bed. Satisfied that the room is empty and devoid of traps, Marik decides that the room can be used for their evening's stay.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) propositions the innkeeper of [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md), offering to play music in exchange for a room and drinks. The innkeeper reluctantly accepts, but notes that Vētrall has already paid for a room, so free drinks is all they'll get. Vētrall reluctantly accepts, feeling there is still an opportunity to play for tips.

After setting up and beginning to play their lute near to the door, Vētrall notices [Lonearm](../characters/lonearm.md) in a booth towards the back of the room, sat with two other finely dressed patrons in top hats, having private conversation. Vētrall uses Enthralling Performance on him, trying to lure him in with their songs, but the effect fails to take hold. Regardless, Vētrall is tipped well over the course of the evening, raking in 10 gp, one of which comes from one of Lorignac's acquaintances when the three leave the inn together. Vētrall plays past midnight until most of the patrons have left.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## Heading to [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md)

In the morning everyone makes their way downstairs for breakfast. A meagre spread of salad is available, which satisfies most of the party.

[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) is the last to emerge downstairs, heading straight over to the bar where [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) is buying three ales for the party. He swipes one and begins drinking it, murmuring in response to Kera's surprise. Kera and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) consider the possibility that Nainarv may be an alcoholic.

Consulting their map ([Independent States of the Nil'Savnic Alliance](../maps/independent-states-of-the-nilsavnic-alliance.md)), the party considers the possibility of taking a ship to [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md) to reduce the amount of over-land travel they need to make, and the dangers that come with it. While Marik and Nainarv enjoy their breakfast, Kera and Valan once again head out to investigate.

They make their way down to the dock, finding four ships currently docked. Two of them sport orange sails and belong to the [Bay of Splendour](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/bay-of-splendour.md)'s navy. The other two are trade ships:

| Ship | Destination | Departure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | [Arrepont](../places/settlements/cities/arrepont.md) | Midday |
| [Montrose](../places/ships/montrose.md) | [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md) | Sunset |

Kera learns that the [Montrose](../places/ships/montrose.md) came from Kurzu and is headed to [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md) at sunset, looking to avoid the busy ship traffic at this end of the [Gulf of Tanelle](../places/topography/seas-bays/gulf-of-tanelle.md) by night. The captain offers the party passage to [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md) for 1 sp each, which Kera accepts, paying for all five people.

With the party's travel plans secured for that evening, the party has the rest of the day in [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md), though most choose to remain in [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md) and enjoy a quiet sit.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) takes off alone to search for more information on what happened in [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) but learns no more than Kera and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) did. They find the traders give them a wide berth, interpreting their line of questions and attire as some sort of salesperson, treating them with suspicion.

Vētrall then goes down to the dock for the rest of the afternoon, sitting on the dock, watching the ships come and go across the [Gulf of Tanelle](../places/topography/seas-bays/gulf-of-tanelle.md). They are afforded a clear view of the spires of [Arrepont](../places/settlements/cities/arrepont.md) and of central [Savnia](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/savnia.md) across the gulf.

Around sunset the party regroups at the dock and boards the [Montrose](../places/ships/montrose.md). They sleep on the deck of the ship overnight, making do with their sleeping bags.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

The party wakes early the following morning, the [Montrose](../places/ships/montrose.md) not far from [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md). The day is cloudy. Before long the ship docks in one of the three parallel dock spots at the base of the town.

## Arriving in [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md)

Disembarking from the [Montrose](../places/ships/montrose.md), the party find themselves at the dock's edge where a bustling day market is taking place. They notice vendors selling a variety of trade goods as well as smoked kippers and punnets of winter fruits.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) spot two pairs of guard-like figures ([Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md)) stood amongst the crowds, the closest pair not far away to their left. After disembarking and standing for a moment, the [Waldwächters](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) come over to greet them.

*[Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md), in [Valburgisch](../languages/valburgisch.md):*
> Hallo, wilkommen in [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md).

The human male [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) immediately realises that the party doesn't speak [Valburgisch](../languages/valburgisch.md) and switches to common, while his ginger haired dwarven counterpart watches on silently. He asks the party what their business is in [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md).

Vētrall explains that they're from [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) and are making their way to [Hochwald](../places/settlements/cities/hochwald.md), just passing through. The guard recognises [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) and asks if they know of [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md). Vētrall's face lights up as they explain that they are part of [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md). The guard takes it as a joke, not expecting the party to actually be reputable adventurers. This offends Vētrall who worries that they don't look the part.

Vētrall pulls out their [Coin of Friendship](../items/coins/coin-of-friendship.md) which immediately convinces the [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) who hastily apologies. He asks [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) if they are members of [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) too, but Marik says that they are merely associates of Vētrall and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md).

The [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) encourages them to check the notice board up the street, noting that the Knight of [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md) is requesting the help of adventurers and is paying for their services. Vētrall asks for specifics, but the guard points them to the board for the full details. He only mentions that it is a pest problem around [Sonnigeweide](../places/settlements/villages/sonnigeweide.md).

The party begin to make their way up the switchback main street of [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md). As they go they note the pastel coloured buildings, with Valan making comparison between a baby blue building and Vētrall.

*[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md):*
> Look, my brother!

As Vētrall says this, the homeowner is wafting bed linen out of the first floor window. They stop and ask what Vētrall said, but Vētrall is dismissive, embarrassed by the realisation that someone is there. The homeowner finishes shaking their sheet before pulling it back into the window, closing it behind them. As they move away from it, Vētrall and Marik catch them giving Vētrall a puzzled look.

Slightly further up the street the party witnesses a pair of children running down the street to a blackberry bush and grab a handful of berries from it, eating them where they stand before running off. This happens in view of a nearby homeowner who is outside pruning his rose bush. He doesn't bat an eye at the children, suggesting that the bush is communal.

About half way up the straight slope of the street, the cobbles level off at an area where the terraced houses overlooking the gulf disappear briefly. In their place is a semi-circular decorative stone wall that forms a viewpoint over the tiled rooftops and the dock. On the opposite side of the street is a stone brick noticeboard, with three identical posters plastered to it. The remnants of other torn and weathered posters can be seen behind them.

> ADVENTURERS WANTED
>
> [Wolves attack Sonnigeweide](../storylines/wolves-attack-sonnigeweide.md) from the Schulterwood.  
> 40 gp bounty for their defeat, offered by the Knight of [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md), [Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md).  
> More details in [Sonnigeweide](../places/settlements/villages/sonnigeweide.md).

[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) makes his surprise that people are struggling with wolves abundantly clear. Vētrall suggests that this could be some easy coin on the side if the party is willing to get their hands dirty.

## News of the Council

Still examining the poster, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) is startled as a male dwarf's hand slaps onto the noticeboard next to them, containing a brush covered in paste. They look to see a janitor-like worker with a bucket of paste and a bundle of posters, seemingly on his way to various spots to affix them. He brushes paste onto the noticeboard before adhering the paper to it.

Vētrall reads the new notice, detailing today's news:

> The Alliance Senate meets to discuss the capture of [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) by the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md).  
> [The Dragonbrand](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/the-dragonbrand.md) defied expectations when [Algar Stormrage](../characters/algar-stormrage.md), delegate for [Lelxuuth](../places/settlements/cities/lelxuuth.md), said enough was enough and swift action must be taken.  
> A vote is to be held next week.

> Home of [Vachel Boucher](../characters/vachel-boucher.md) discovered!  
> Remains of the pianist's home in [Naissance](../places/settlements/cities/arrepont.md) discovered when digging foundations for new apartments. Construction has been halted while archaeologists look for remains.

Hearing Algar's name, Valan immediately takes off back down the street and dips into a steep stepped alley, out of sight. Here he sits, head in hands, considering the implications of an old enemy being present in the nearby city of [Arrepont](../places/settlements/cities/arrepont.md). The party don't notice Valan's disappearance as they continue to debate going to [Sonnigeweide](../places/settlements/villages/sonnigeweide.md) to deal with the wolves.

Valan emerges within the next 5 minutes, around the time that the party begin looking for him. Vētrall spots him heading back up the street that they came up, looking glum. When asked what's wrong, he claims not to be feeling too well, which gets the party of his case.

## Walking to [Sonnigeweide](../places/settlements/villages/sonnigeweide.md)

In agreement that [Sonnigeweide](../places/settlements/villages/sonnigeweide.md) is a minor detour and that the party would like to help with the wolf problems there, the party make their way up the rest of the road, reaching [Lilaweg](../places/roads/lilaweg.md) as the land flattens out. Here they notice smaller and less impressive lower class dwellings, as well as stables on the opposite side of the road. Feeling that their journey to [Sonnigeweide](../places/settlements/villages/sonnigeweide.md) will be short, they simply decide to walk it.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) leads with [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) alongside him. Kera is humming the tune of Vētrall's song from last night, prompting Vētrall to pull out their lute and play along. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) occupy the middle of the pack while [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) keeps his distance at the back, wanting some space while mulling over what he wants to do about the news of the Alliance Senate's meeting.

After two hours of walking, a giant dark rain cloud moves in from the south, quickly darkening the sky. As it arrives, a massive downpour begins to drench the party. They choose to press on, but in the low visibility conditions, Kera gets lost, heading off road into taller grass. As the party emerges into a clearing with no sign of a path, it becomes clear that they no longer know where they are. Collectively they decide to take shelter. Marik spots a large oak tree nearby, so the party heads over to it, seeking shelter under its canopy of autumn leaves.

As the rain continues to pour and large drops of water penetrate the leaves, hitting the party below, the party decides to wait out the storm. As it continues to get darker, it dawns on everyone that they should probably camp for the night. The ground underfoot is wet but not soaked, so they make the most of the situation. Marik heads out in search of firewood but finds little wood, and what she does find is rotten and soaked right through already. No fire is made.

## Camping for the Night

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) volunteer to take first watch while [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) will take second watch.

As everyone else settles to sleep, Kera and Valan talk of their pasts. Kera offers the story of how he joined the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md), explaining that he stumbled into a situation where he ended up following some people who roped him into signing a contract that bound him to the skimmers. Valan shares in kind, explaining that he is divorced and has been for some 100 years before recently being invited to join [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md).

Kera questions Valan's particular like of potatoes. He explains that where he is from, potatoes are a rare delicacy, so they carry a special value to him, even to this day. He expresses a wish to retire to a humble farm where he can farm his own potatoes. Kera relates this to his previously expressed warm feelings towards the idea of retiring in [Kuv'narash](../places/settlements/villages/kuvnarash.md) raking sand.

The conversations peter out as the pair keep their eyes out into the rainy darkness, struggling to see or hear much.

## Owlbear Ambush

Two hours into their watch, the pair are caught off guard by an owlbear that approaches the tree from the darkness, only catching their attention when it is 15ft away and running towards them at full speed.

*[Initiative order begins]*

The owlbear charges straight at [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) in front of it, missing him with its beak but sinking both of its claws deep into his side, catching his ribs. The pain is enough for him to pass out. The screech from the owlbear wakes up the rest of the party.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) grabs his greatsword and slashes at the owlbear, drawing first blood. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) stands up and casts Faerie Fire at the owlbear, causing it to glow faintly, making it easier to hit. Nainarv follows Marik's lead, standing and casting Bless on Marik, Valan and Kera.

As [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) wakes they cast Cure Wounds on Valan, causing him to come back to consciousness on the ground in front of the owlbear. Vētrall encourages Valan to act quickly to avoid further damage, using [Just As I Taught You](../mechanics/character-features/just-as-i-taught-you.md) to give him an immediate extra turn. Valan uses the opportunity to disengage and put some distance between him and the owlbear, readying his bow as he goes.

The owlbear turns its attention towards Kera, but fails to connect with either its beak or claws. Kera retaliates by slashing it twice with his greatsword, using a Goading Attack to draw its attention into him specifically. Marik throws her spear at it, piercing its shoulder and lodging the spear there. Valan casts Ensnaring Strike before loosing an arrow at the owlbear. It hits, but the owlbear resists the magic and remains mobile.

The party are horrified to see a second owlbear run into the fray, arriving alongside the first one. Kera disengages around to the side of the tree while Valan continues shooting the first owlbear with arrows and getting distance amongst the rainy night. Marik casts Heat Metal on the metal spear tip, causing it to glow red hot and burn the owlbear's shoulder. It shrieks and shakes its shoulders, dislodging the spear.

[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) runs into battle with the first owlbear, attempting but failing to hit it with his hammer. Vētrall casts Phantasmal Force on the first owlbear, causing it to believe that a small wyvern is attacking it from melee range. The owlbear becomes preoccupied with this creature in its mind, seemingly attacking thin air while everyone else watches on. Kera uses the opportunity to dive in and slash at it, cutting it across its chest and finishing it off.

Kera follows this up with a series of devastating blows to the other owlbear, but it is finished off by Valan who threads an arrow through its eye, pushing it into its head, before the arrow emerges from the roof of its mouth. This causes the owlbear to die instantly and collapse in front of Kera.

*[Initiative order ends]*

Shaken up by the surprise encounter in the night, the party compose themselves before [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) resume their watch, everyone else returning to sleep. The rest of their watch is uneventful.

Kera kicks Marik and Valan puts a finger up Vētrall's nose to wake the next watch party. The pair are annoyed by their rude awakenings but settle in for their watch. Marik is particularly tired, not gaining a long rest from the disrupted sleep. Vētrall is fine due to their trance.

During the second half of the night there is no discernible threat or activity detected through the cover of heavy rain. As sunset nears the rain lets up somewhat, becoming a light drizzle.

*[Kera, Nainarv, Vētrall, Valan: long rest]*  
*[Marik: short rest]*

By morning the party begin to pack up their camp. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) casts Druidcraft to check the day's weather. She traces the shape of a sphere, top to bottom, with both hands, creating a glass orb with a semi-transparent interior. She looks within, seeing drizzle falling before it disappears, turning to streaks of sunlight cutting through the foggy interior. She is satisfied to learn that the rain won't last much longer. As she un-cups her hands from the sphere, it fades from existence where it sat.

## Vētrall's Climbing Lesson

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) goes over to [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), informing him that it's time for a lesson. Vētrall explains that it's time they teach him to climb a tree. Valan is immediately dismissive, pointing out that he already knows how to climb one as he spent his early years in and around the forest.

Vētrall tries to save the situation by pointing out that Valan should watch out for wasps' nests while climbing. Valan reacts explosively, condescendingly pointing out that it is good advice and the first thing that Vētrall has actually taught him. The pair begin shouting at each other. Valan accuses Vētrall of being a terrible teacher while Vētrall bemoans getting stuck with such a disrespectful student that they didn't even want in the first place.

Eventually [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) comes over to try and stop the pair. He asks Valan what he'd like to learn, but Valan doesn't know. Nainarv holds his hammer out, head facing down, pushing it to Valan's chest.

*[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md):*
> Here, give this a try.

*[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md):*
> Can I swing it at Vētrall?

*[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md):*
> You can swing it at me.

As Valan raises the hammer, Nainarv moves to him to begin adjusting his stance and grip on the weapon. Vētrall immediately storms off in a huff, going to the other side of the oak tree and leaning against it. Nainarv places a hand on Valan's shoulder, casting Guidance while telling him to give him his best shot.

Valan swings the hammer at Nainarv but comes short, the head sinking into the ground slightly as it departs Valan's grip. Nainarv lets out a hearty laugh at the failed attempt, but after composing himself calls it a good first effort, pointing out to Valan that you have to lean forward more if you want the hammer to connect. Nainarv picks it up from the floor and twirls it back into an upright position, concluding their lesson.

When Vētrall sees that the pair have finished, they begin climbing the tree to show off, hoping to reclaim some respect. They deftly grapple up the trunk of the tree (natural 20), grabbing the first branch before pushing off it, landing on its top by their feet - an acrobatic feat in its own right. From here they scramble up through the branches until the canopy of leaves becomes too dense to see much out from.

Vētrall takes a look at the surrounding landscape, immediately noticing a village set amongst cultivated farmland, with a forest's edge behind it. They spot two white windmills at either edge of the village center. On the way down Vētrall tries to swing from the bottom branch but loses a hand at the last moment, causing them to slide in the mud. They manage to retain their balance, ending with a performative flourish outwards with their arms. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) are impressed by the acrobatics on display.

Vētrall informs the party that they saw a village from the top of the tree and will lead the party in its direction. From the bottom of the tree the undulating plains make it impossible to see, so the party trusts Vētrall to lead them in the right direction.

## Arriving in [Sonnigeweide](../places/settlements/villages/sonnigeweide.md)

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) leads the party across the grassy plains for 30 minutes, [Sonnigeweide](../places/settlements/villages/sonnigeweide.md) coming into view ahead of them. Eventually the grass turns to farmers' fields, not currently being cultivated after the recent autumn harvest. Between two fields is a trench with a stream flowing heavily at its bottom, swelled from yesterday's rain. Vētrall leads the party along the side of the field and crosses over at a cobble stone bridge.

From there the party follows a dirt track towards the village. As they begin to pass between the humble buildings they spot a waterwheel attached to a house, with one of the two white windmills on its other side.

Arriving in the village centre, the party quickly spot [the Nasty Huntress](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-nasty-huntress.md), an inn that appears to just be a regular house with a sign bolted to it. They opt to head inside, hoping to find someone who will point them to [Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md).

Inside they find [Askad Greybelt](../characters/askad-greybelt.md) in her kitchen, moving baking bread around in her kiln. She doesn't acknowledge the party as they enter, so [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) picks a slice of bread from the table in the centre of the kitchen, eating it at once. Askad asks if he'll pay for that, not turning to face him as she does. Kera agrees, paying 1 cp. Kera asks if there is more food. Askad offers bread with [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md) jam and clotted cream, which the party find the notion of delicious. Askad takes the cloth from a bowl set on the bench on the far side of the room. She dusts down the middle table and begins vigorously working the dough, putting all her strength into it, an amount that catches Marik by surprise. The bread is soon placed in the oven to bake.

Marik asks Askad about the wolves and where they can find [Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md). She explains that the Knight of [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md) is out on patrol but is expected back for the evening meal. The party take this as a sign that they should stay put here until then.

[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) spots a door hole into the next room, heading there hastily. He sits at one of the larger tables, alone in the tavern-style room. There he quickly pens a letter ([L-MC-08](../letters/L-MC-08.md)) to [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) while he is unsighted. Once he is finished, he beckons everyone to join him so they can eat lunch.

Kera orders a few ales before Nainarv insists on ordering so that everyone has two to enjoy. When he realises how many ales that would be, he opts instead to buy two kegs of ale. Seeing how big they both are, he immediately regrets buying a second, content with it being set on the floor for now. Askad uses a small hammer and a tap to tap the keg, positioning the keg so that the tap overhangs the table, perfect for filling up ale mugs.

Valan asks Askad for wine but she has none. Instead he asks if she has any potatoes. She offers him some raw potatoes from her pantry, but Valan wants them baked. Askad offers to bake something for him with them, but it won't be ready until the evening meal. Valan dismisses the idea. Shortly after, Askad returns with the promised bread, jam, and clotted cream.

## Valan Leaves Suddenly

Once everyone is enjoying their food and each others' company, [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) gets up and heads back into the kitchen. There he quietly gets [Askad Greybelt](../characters/askad-greybelt.md)'s attention, giving her the letter ([L-MC-08](../letters/L-MC-08.md)) and asking if she'll give it to "the blue one" in 5 minutes. Askad is confused but agrees, not sure what is happening.

Valan shouts to the other room, informing everyone that he is going to the toilet. He leaves the inn, shutting the door behind him.

After a few minutes Askad emerges, wordlessly handing the letter to [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md). She lingers, wishing to know what it says and what exactly is going on. Vētrall opens it immediately and reads it. As soon as they finish they rocket up from their chair and charge out the front door. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) shouts after them, trying to learn what's going on, but Vētrall doesn't respond.

Vētrall hears the sound of running through the streets of [Sonnigeweide](../places/settlements/villages/sonnigeweide.md), taking off at speed in their direction. They're able to follow them for a while, shouting at Valan to get back here while giving chase. Valan runs away, seeking a hiding spot.

Eventually he comes across a street of nicer terraced houses with front gardens, some of which have hedges behind their picket fences. Valan dives behind one, sitting with his back to it, remaining as still as he can. Drizzle continues to fall on him as he waits for Vētrall to give up.

Vētrall loses the sound of Valan's footsteps, so begins wandering the streets while shouting for him. After half an hour of this, they realise that they've lost Valan. A farmer holding a large sheet of leather over his head like an umbrella crosses paths with Vētrall.

*Farmer:*
> Shut up, the whole damned village can hear your whining.

Vētrall, frustrated, heads back to [the Nasty Huntress](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-nasty-huntress.md). They head back to the party's table, wet with rain, and sit down. Kera asks what's going on. They give a panicked explanation that the letter is from Valan, and they've gone. When asked what it says, Vētrall paraphrases the letter, using its structure to project their own opinion:

*[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md):*
> "I'm sorry I'm an asshole."

Vētrall calls Valan a bad student. Kera retorts quickly, not having any of it, telling Vētrall that they're being too hard on him, not treating him like the adult he is:

*[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md):*
> The point is, Valan already had a life and you treat him like a child.

Kera's words ring through Vētrall's ears. [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md), listening along intently, nods in begrudging agreement, silently sorry to be bringing a harsh truth to Vētrall. Nainarv then speaks up, building on Kera's point to ask Vētrall to respect Valan's past experiences before becoming a member of [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md).

## Meeting Lorena

Suddenly the front door opens and the party can hear someone step into the inn. [Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md) can be heard briefly talking with [Askad Greybelt](../characters/askad-greybelt.md), Askad telling her that some people are here looking for her. She enters the room and introduces herself:

*[Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md):*
> Hello, my name is [Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md), [Waldwächter](../organisations/guards/waldwachter.md) Knight of [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md). Are you here about the wolves?

The party confirms that they are, causing a smile to appear on her face.

*[Lorena Bynelor](../characters/lorena-bynelor.md):*
> Well in that case, give me a moment to sit with you, and I'll tell you what I know.
