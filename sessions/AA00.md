## Introduction

> It is time. Your training is complete. Tomorrow you will become one of us, a proud member of the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Through your dedication and vigilance, the natural world around us will be kept in check, kept in balance.
>
> You will explore the frontier and encounter new and dangerous sights. You will ensure the forests and rivers and fields thrive so that future generations may benefit from their bounty. You will challenge those who seek to exploit resources for personal gain at the detriment of others.
>
> This will not be an easy task, as there will be many who oppose you. The might of the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) controls much of Astor, and they hold power absolute. But despite what they may say, they have no power over us. Our power to act is granted by the same generals who empower them.
>
> Stand strong, and do your duty - for the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)!

## Background

*Note: In this section anything in bold is strictly mandatory.*

*Note: Rolling tables are provided to help you make backstory choices. You may use one of the options that you choose, roll a die to pick one at random, or simply use the options as inspiration for your own choice.*

### Being [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md)

Characters that possess magical abilities are considered [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md). See the above sections for more info on what this means.

**The following classes are [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md): Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard.** Other subclasses may be classed as [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) at my discretion. As a rule of thumb, if you have visible abilities that commoners would consider magical, you are seen as [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md).

To have gone through life to this point and not be conscripted into the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) is no small task. How did you get this far?

| d6 | [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) Background |
|:---:| --- |
| 1 | My magical abilities have only recently started awakening. |
| 2 | I have known that I am [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) from a young age but have no difficulty keeping it a secret. |
| 3 | I have known that I am [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) from a young age and struggle to control it. Keeping it a secret is a constant battle. |
| 4 | I refused to join the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) willingly and was outcast. I eventually found a way to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) instead. |
| 5 | The [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) knows I am [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) and has been searching for me incessantly. Their search ended when I joined the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). |
| 6 | I was conscripted by the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) but selected by the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) for being a promising candidate.<br>**(Max 1 character)** |

### Becoming an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md)

At the start of the campaign you will be about to graduate to the full active service as an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), following **two to four years of training by the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) directly**. Your graduating cohort will be around 100 strong.

To get to this point, your character has **willingly joined the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md)**. Why did they do so?

| d12 |[Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) Motivation |
|:---:| --- |
| 1 | I want to see more of the world around me. |
| 2 | I want to become a citizen so that I can start my own business. |
| 3 | I want to become a citizen in order to pull myself out of the lower class. |
| 4 | I want to ascend the class ladder and see how far I can get. |
| 5 | I want to ascend the class ladder to increase my standing/wealth/authority. |
| 6 | I am in trouble with the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) - becoming an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) gives me immunity from them. |
| 7 | I have a hard life and am seeking a position that allows me to relax more. |
| 8 | I have a hard home life - becoming an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) removes me from it. |
| 9 | I believe in the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and their mission, and want to do my part. |
| 10 | I have an affinity for nature - becoming an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) allows me to help it. |
| 11 | I have seen others destroying nature and want to empower myself to stop them. |
| 12 | I hate the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and want to get one over on them. |

### Your Graduate Cohort

You will be one of about 100 [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) graduates that are about to enter service.

Over the course of your training you have interacted with some of them, and have heard of the rest. **You do not personally know any of the other player characters.**

That being said, you have heard of them!

Stories and rumours go around the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) training programme about interesting recruits and their salacious deeds.

Prior to the first session, each player will be given [two truths and a lie](../mechanics/roleplay/two-truths-and-a-lie.md) about each character, though they will not know which one is the lie.

**Your backstory needs to be accompanied by [two truths and a lie](../mechanics/roleplay/two-truths-and-a-lie.md). These should be one sentence long each, and should be labelled as "[truth]" or "[lie]" and clearly separated from the rest of your backstory.**

| d12 | Rumours |
|:---:| --- |
| 1 |I am originally from outside of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). |

| 3 |I was a criminal prior to training as an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). |
| 4 |I am secretly [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md). The [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) would accept me, but I still keep it to myself. |
| 5 |I believe so strongly in the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) that I don’t suffer well those who don’t. |
| 6 |I don’t believe in any of the four [gods](../gods/gods.md) and will pledge myself to one of them in bad faith. |
| 7 |I started a fight with one of my mentors. |
| 8 |I started a fight with one of my fellow trainees. |
| 9 |I have been training to be an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) for a lot longer than everyone else in our cohort. |
| 10 | I am favoured by the mentors and given special treatment. |
| 11 | I change my appearance so often, nobody knows who I really am. |
| 12 | I am trouble to anyone that tries to befriend me. |

## Character Choices

### Ability Scores

Selected during session 0. Each player could pick one of the following methods:

- Standard array.
- Roll method:
  - Roll 6 ability scores:
    - Roll 4d6.
    - Re-roll up to one d6 that has a value of 1. Do not repeat if the value is 1 again.
    - Remove the lowest value of the 4d6.
    - Sum the remaining 3d6 values.
  - Apply each of the 6 ability score values to abilities of your choice.

## Mystery Rolls

I made each player do some additional rolls with no context. These can be used for whatever I need story-wise.
