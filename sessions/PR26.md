## Before the Match

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Komodo squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) meet up behind the arena area in [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), awaiting their call to enter the arena for the [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md) final.

Both squads exchange wordless glances at each other. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) waves while [Faelon Fireburner](../characters/faelon-fireburner.md) glances knowingly at his squad before sizing up their competition.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), under the effects of the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) she consumed earlier in the day, is looking worse for wear. She has turned up covered in face paint: black around her eyes, and black & purple around her lips. It surprises her party how skittish she looks.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) question her appearance and behaviour, questioning if she is drunk. Saoirse plays it off as normal, which [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) agrees with, slapping mood from the floor all over her face.

Before long an [Astorrel agents](../campaigns/C2-astorrel-agents.md) calls both teams into the arena. The usual [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad introductions are made to the audience before the last match of the tournament begins.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## After the Match

The match win is declared a victory for [Komodo squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) as the crowd erupts into applause. [Eremus Vitur](../characters/eremus-vitur.md) pulls off a double backflip in celebration.

[Faelon Fireburner](../characters/faelon-fireburner.md) runs over to [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) to check that she is okay, half collapsing to the ground as he arrives at her unconscious body. The [Astorrel members](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) present in and around the arena bring everyone back to consciousness and begin to heal their wounds

[Uther Wildfang](../characters/uther-wildfang.md) and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) search for their thrown weapons. Uther finds his in the crowd. Torbra's halberd, which left the arena entirely, is eventually thrown into the crowd and passed forward, allowing her to collect it.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) regains consciousness and immediately freaks out, pushing the [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) away from her before getting up and darting out of the arena. [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) are too wrapped up in the match's aftermath to notice this.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) wakes up and asks the [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) tending to her if her squad won. She is informed that unfortunately they lost. [Faelon Fireburner](../characters/faelon-fireburner.md) does a victory lap around the arena (natural 20), stoking the crowd who begin to chant his name.

Eventually both teams congregate underneath the tournament's officials, at which point an [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) asks [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) where their fourth is, bringing Saoirse's absence to their attention.

[Liabella Peacock](../characters/liabella-peacock.md), [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md), and [Itharmund Steeleye](../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) emerge into the arena, ceremonially shaking the hands of each member of both squads before awarding [Komodo squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) with gold tournament winner's medals. On one side is the impression of the symbols of both [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) and [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md). On the other is the text "[Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md) winner".

A large chest is brought out into the arena and opened, revealing a deceptively small interior filled with the 100 pp winner's bounty. [Faelon Fireburner](../characters/faelon-fireburner.md) takes his share and distributes it to members of the crowd, handing coins to disadvantaged looking people and throwing the rest randomly. This causes a few spectators to jump into the arena and attempt to charge toward the chest. [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) raises his hand, casting Mass Suggestion to compel them to drop to their knees.

Following both squads' exit from the arena, a formal after party begins which includes the tournament officials and both final match squads. Both groups enjoy the festivities (except for Saoirse who is nowhere to be seen), particularly [Komodo squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) who are praised as the tournament's winners.
