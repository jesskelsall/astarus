## Returning to [Creek](../characters/creek.md)

While away from the [Scintil Delta](../places/rivers-lakes/scintil-delta.md), [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) receive a letter ([MC01M-L-1](../letters/MC01M-L-1.md)) from their [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) contract, [Creek](../characters/creek.md), requesting their presence at [Tabaxi's Folly](../places/buildings/tabaxis-folly.md). Marik reads it to Kera who is illiterate. [Creek](../characters/creek.md) notes their debt to him after he bailed them out of jail earlier in their [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) career.

The pair make their way back to [Murkwallow](../places/cities/murkwallow.md), heading across the [River Scintil](../places/rivers-lakes/river-scintil.md) by boat and into the city. Once there they locate one of the secret entrances hidden under a canal bridge, pressing the secret cobblestone button to unlock the push-in door.

Once inside, the door is closed behind them, causing the tunnel to go pitch black. Marik leads, casting Produce Flame to create a light source to lead the way with. Kera is amused by the secret entrance.

The pair emerge into [Tabaxi's Folly](../places/buildings/tabaxis-folly.md)'s main area which is mostly empty except for a few skimmers who are silently eating their meals from the canteen. Knowing where to go, they head over to a door around the edge of the low cavern, entering into [Creek's Bar](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/creeks-bar.md).

Here they meet [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) who immediately starts pouring the pair an ale each. He is happy to see them again but doesn't ask about their exploits or why they have returned. Kera pays for both drinks (8 cp) with 1 sp which he receives no change for. Kera immediately downs both, so Marik orders another (4 cp).

When Kera asks if [Creek](../characters/creek.md) is in, [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) replies that of course he is. [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) excuses himself to the back room for a moment to see if [Creek](../characters/creek.md) is ready for them. Kera and Marik take a seat at one of the tables while they wait.

## The [Hammersmiths](../organisations/hammersmiths.md) Send an Assassin

While [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) is in the back room, a hooded humanoid figure enters, making their way over to a table on the opposite side of the room. The figure pulls out a wooden dowel and a carving knife, diligently working the wood while they sit hunched forward. Kera and Marik don't recognise them, but it isn't uncommon to find people in [Tabaxi's Folly](../places/buildings/tabaxis-folly.md) that they don't recognise, particularly in the main cafeteria area. They both think nothing of it.

When [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) returns, the hooded figure gets up from their table and approaches the bar, leaving their carving knife and dowel on the table. [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) acknowledges them before the figure throws open their robe, pulling out a shortsword and plunging it in [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md)'s direction.

*[Initiative order begins]*

The figure is unable to land a hit on [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) who dives out of the way, dropping prone behind the bar. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) waste no time leaping up from their table, unarmed. Kera runs over and gores the figure with his minotaur horns, dealing a fair blow.

Marik casts Thorn Whip, pulling the figure away from the bar, the thorns sinking into their skin as they go. This spins them around and lowers their hood, revealing a mid teens human girl with a mixed look of terror and steely determination across her face.

The pair silently resolve to capture the would-be assassin. Marik lands another blow with his horns, knocking her out. Marik grabs her rope and ties her up.

*[Initiative order ends]*

As the sounds of combat fade, Kera asks [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) if he is okay. He is furious at the pair for not noticing the shifty figure entering, angrily blaming them both for the threat to his own life.

The door to the back room flies open as [Creek](../characters/creek.md) emerges:

*[Creek](../characters/creek.md):*
> What the bloody hell is going on in here!?

Marik gives an assessment of the situation while [Creek](../characters/creek.md) scopes the room. Kera brings the unconscious girl to her feet, showing [Creek](../characters/creek.md) who attacked them. Without any knowledge of who this person is, [Creek](../characters/creek.md) concludes the encounter by pulling out a butterfly knife which he slits her throat with before wiping the blood on her robes and returning it to his pocket with a twirling flourish.

Kera is unfazed by this. Marik finds the moment tragic and sad but understands that this is just business.

As [Creek](../characters/creek.md) returns to his back room, Kera attempts to put the body on the bar, but [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) explodes with anger as he tries, causing her to lay it on the floor instead. [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) goes on a rant about how this life is too dangerous and now they have all of this blood to clean up. He grabs a large blood splattered rag from behind the bar and begins working on mopping the blood up from the bar and floor.

Marik retrieves her rope.

## Business with [Creek](../characters/creek.md)

[Creek](../characters/creek.md) shouts from within the other room at the pair, ushering them inside. He thanks them both for helping to protect both [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) and himself.

[Creek](../characters/creek.md) has business for the pair, alluding to the letter that brought them both here. He makes it clear that the events that this job will set into motion could be incredibly lucrative. If they play their part, he is willing to call their debt even. The pair agree to help.

He details the job. There is a songbird ([Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md)) being held captive by a blue dragonborn ([Thelraar Avrae](../characters/thelraar-avrae.md)) in [the Terrific Toad](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-terrific-toad.md) here in [Murkwallow](../places/cities/murkwallow.md). Their job is to free the songbird and escort them to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md). The pair aren't familiar with songbirds outside of Kera knowing that they are kenku, and neither inquire about who in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) to bring them to. [Creek](../characters/creek.md) makes it clear that the songbird should be kept out of sight of any guards they come across.

Kera suggests that [Creek](../characters/creek.md) increases [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md)'s pay as he is having a particularly bad day. [Creek](../characters/creek.md) grins, taking his words under advisement. When the pair leave, Marik chastises Kera for bringing that up while they are being given important business.

The pair head out of [Tabaxi's Folly](../places/buildings/tabaxis-folly.md) and across [Murkwallow](../places/cities/murkwallow.md).

## Finding the Songbird

The pair enter [the Terrific Toad](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-terrific-toad.md), finding the place rowdy with much activity including a band (drummer and lute player) and a ring of [Twenties](../mechanics/roleplay/games/twenties.md) players near the back of the room. The skimmers head over to the bar, waiting patiently for 5 minutes before ordering drinks from [Leofrick de Bolbec](../characters/leofrick-de-bolbec.md).

When Leofrick comes over, hurriedly moving between patrons in a precise nature, he moves to another patron when Marik is slow with her order. Marik grabs him by the chest and pulls him closer, causing a crowd to notice the commotion, the music stopping. Marik makes an order of 2 ales (4 cp). Leofrick signals to the band to keep playing, causing the tense moment to subside.

The skimmers leave the bar area and look around the room for a blue dragonborn. After a while they spot [Thelraar Avrae](../characters/thelraar-avrae.md) sitting at a table by herself, hunched over her mug of ale. She is only noticed when another table of patrons in front of her get up to leave.

Going over to her, Marik does the talking. She greets the dragonborn plainly, wasting no time informing her that she has something that belongs to them. This spooks Avrae who beings to tremble, asking for specifics. Marik is initially reluctant to say exactly what, causing Avrae to double down out of both fear and wilful ignorance.

Kera sits on the table at an angle, almost sitting on Avrae's drink. She swipes it out of the way and leaps to her feet. Marik taunts her, pointing out that she'll lose her seat if she's not careful. Avrae grows increasingly terrified by the pair. Eventually Kera tells Avrae that they are here for the songbird.

*[Thelraar Avrae](../characters/thelraar-avrae.md):*
> Oh shit.

Avrae fails to hide their terror, knowing that the pair are here for the songbird in her custody. She reaches into her robe, but Marik grabs her arm, pulling it out for her, revealing an inn room key. When interrogated she confirms that it is for a room here at [the Terrific Toad](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-terrific-toad.md).

When Avrae asks if she can go now, Kera and Marik insist she comes with. Avrae leads them upstairs to the room, where Marik opens the door. While the skimmers are looking inside, Avrae bolts, running out of the inn to escape the encounter.

Inside is [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) sat on the bed cross legged. They turn to the skimmers and stare at them blankly. When Marik tells them that it is time to go, they get up and prepare to follow the pair out of the inn.

Kera and Marik briefly consider how best to leave, considering exiting into [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) below via the window. [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) puts up their hood and retracts their arms into their long sleeves, showing that the sleeves are in excess of the length of their arms, the spare material dangling comically. Marik considers this enough of a disguise, their beak mostly covered by the hood.

The three begin to leave, doing their best to blend in and look nonchalant. A small group of thugs enters the tavern, seeing Kera looking suspicious. While Marik watches Kera briefly converse with the thugs, [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) sneaks out into the street and goes into [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) behind in the inn. Marik loses the songbird and becomes worried.

Once the skimmers are outside, Marik hears the sound of two coins hitting the cobbled street. She follows the sound, arriving at [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md), where she finds [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) waiting for her. This is her first exposure to mimicry. The three reconvene.

Some time is spent in [Murkwallow](../places/cities/murkwallow.md) gathering supplies before hitting the road south east to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md). Knowing that the journey will take an amount of days, Kera buys 8 day rations (4 gp) which Marik holds on to. These supplement the skimmers existing rations, providing food for their escort.

## Heading South East

The party exits [Murkwallow](../places/cities/murkwallow.md) by boat. Once on the south side of the [Scintil Delta](../places/rivers-lakes/scintil-delta.md), they assess their transportation options along the Emerald Way. Deciding that it is best not to attract attention they opt to travel on foot. Marik leads the way while Kera watches the rear.

An uneventful day passes walking along the Emerald Way, enjoying the rolling grassy fields with views of the Scintil Swamp to the west.

Half way to [Kulevi](../places/towns/kulevi.md) they stop for the night, setting up a camp and lighting a bonfire.

## Wolves in the Night

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) takes first watch while [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) sleep. During this watch two wolves sneak up on their camp, eyeing up a fight. Kera fails to spot them, allowing the wolves to get the drop on the sleeping Marik.

*[Initiative order begins]*

One wolf bites down on Marik while the second jumps into the middle of the camp to attack Kera. Marik immediately wakes up, while [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) initially remains asleep.

Kera fights back against the wolf with his horns, eventually equipping his warhammer and shield. The wolf attacking him switches to Marik, ganging up on her with the other wolf. Marik barely gets out of her sleeping bag before she is knocked unconscious.

[Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) runs off into the night to put some distance between them and the wolves. As the fight develops they pluck up the courage to mimic a brown bear roar, petrifying the wolves who begin to flee. Kera finishes one off while the other escapes, severely wounded.

[Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) runs over to Marik, helping to stabilise her.

*[Initiative order ends]*

Kera remains awake on watch for the rest of the night, taking a point of exhaustion due to a lack of sleep. Marik sleeps right through, eventually waking in the early morning, bruised and battered. She rests for a while before camp is packed up.

*[Long rest: [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md)]*  
*[Short rest: [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md), [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md)]*

## Guards on the Road

After packing up camp the party eat rations for breakfast. Marik passes one to [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) who pecks at it messily, wasting food much to Marik's disappointment.

The party hits the road together, remaining in the same formation. By afternoon they arrive at the Key to the North road, following it south toward [Kulevi](../places/towns/kulevi.md).

About 30 minutes later they encounter three guards of the [Bay Watch](../organisations/guards/bay-watch.md) riding on horseback, patrolling northward along the road. Not spotting them until they are in good visual range, Kera hides [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) behind them as they walk.

The guards notice a kenku with the party, stopping to chat to the group. The guards are pleasant and inquire where the party is going, to which they honestly answer that they are going to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) via [Kulevi](../places/towns/kulevi.md). When the guards question the kenku, the skimmers are able to convince the guards that [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) is just one of their party members. The guards opt not to press the issue and move on, giving the kenku a final glance as they ride off.

## Staying Overnight in [Kulevi](../places/towns/kulevi.md)

By early evening the party arrives in [Kulevi](../places/towns/kulevi.md). Kera wishes to check out the clothing stores but they have already closed for the day. The party finds an inn to stay at: [The Quail's Nest](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-quails-nest.md).

Once inside they order drinks and ask about a room for the night. Single and double rooms are offered. Kera insists that one double room will be fine, offering to sleep on the floor.

The party finds a room with two single beds. Marik and [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) take a bed each, though the songbird opts to sit on the bed cross legged with their back against the wall rather than getting into bed. Kera is content sleeping in his bed roll on the floor.

*[Long rest]*

## Ambushed by the [Hammersmiths](../organisations/hammersmiths.md)

Before the party wakes, the [Hammersmiths](../organisations/hammersmiths.md) clear out the inn, setting an ambush for the party when they awake. This is in place by the time they wake.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) wakes first, [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) not long after. Kera is the last to rouse, having drank plenty before coming to bed. Only when everyone is ready does the party emerge from their room.

Marik leads them out. At the top of the stairs she notices an entirely empty inn, giving her cause for concern. She tells Kera to be careful, leading him down the stairs, with [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) at their rear.

At the bottom of the stairs Marik is greeted by an open door to a supply room. She pokes her head around the corner to investigate, finding a dark blue feathered kenku staring back at her, thrusting a shortsword toward her.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Marik takes a hit to the shoulder before moving out of the way so that Kera can take over. [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) runs for the front door. Before long the other kenku is unconscious due to Kera's sustained warhammer blows.

Three bandits burst through the door in ambush, swarming Marik and Kera. One attempts to pursue [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) who jumps over the bar and hides. This bandit readies a crossbow and begins searching for the songbird, who crawls under the bar searching for a weapon.

Marik casts Faerie Fire on the bandits, making them easier to attack. As they swarm her she takes multiple hits, needing to cast Cure Wounds to stay upright. Kera moves round and attacks both bandits, giving Marik a chance to get some distance while only taking one attack of opportunity.

The unconscious kenku bandit rolls a natural 20 on a death saving throw, returning to consciousness. Once on their feet they run through the supply rooms and out of the building having had enough for one day.

Kera jumps onto the bar and charges the remaining bandit with her warhammer. [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) finds a bottle and breaks it, stabbing the bandit twice, finishing him off.

*[Initiative order ends]*

In the immediate aftermath, [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) asks for food. They consume a ration on the bar while one foot away from the body of the last bandit, leant up against the wall and sat on the bar.

Marik searches the corpses, looting a few gold, a light crossbow, and two scimitars.

## Skipping Town

Before the party can plan their next move, three [Bay Watch](../organisations/guards/bay-watch.md) guards enter the inn, having heard the commotion of combat from nearby. They see the bodies and shout at the party, demanding to know what happened. Marik tries to calmly explain what has happened but the guards aren't interested, moving into the inn, preparing to apprehend all three present.

[Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) realises they need to escape, so they run down the back of the bar area, leap over the divider, and run through the store rooms at the back to escape. Seeing their songbird run off, Marik and Kera follow too. The guards give chase.

Fortunately for the party the guards are slow and quickly lose them. The party is able to find an alley to lay low in while the guards race past in the wrong direction.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) uses Wild Shape to transform into a black cat with a single white paw. She deftly scales one of [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md)'s buildings, climbing to a second storey rooftop. From here she observes the guards running in the wrong direction as well as a second group of guards several streets away, patrolling as normal.

From the rooftop she meows to get Kera's attention and signal which direction the party should go, but he is unaware that it is Marik, not paying her much attention. Marik gets frustrated, jumping from the roof to Kera's shoulder. She barely makes it, grabbing his shoulder with her front legs but falling down his back with her hind legs. She then jumps down and transforms back into her regular goliath form in front of him, proving her identity.

Marik leads the party out of [Kulevi](../places/towns/kulevi.md), hitting the Key to the North road to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md). By the afternoon of the second day, the party arrives.

## Delivering the Songbird to [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md)

Upon arriving in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md), the party are met by a dwarf skimmer who takes them to a [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) contact in the city. They lead them to a dark warehouse where they move a heavy box aside, revealing a trapdoor. The dwarf opens it, lights a candle, and descends into a small tunnel. The party follows.

A brief claustrophobic tunnel leads to an excavated room with a wooden desk, two bookcases behind it, and a few chairs on the opposite side of the 20ft by 15ft space. Sat at the desk is [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md).

[Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) greets the party plainly before turning their attention to [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md), who produces a letter for [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) ([MC01M-L-2](../letters/MC01M-L-2.md)). [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) reads it before flipping it over and casting Detect Magic. Her eyes turn from brown to glowing yellow while a yellow glow emanates from the paper, revealing the hidden message from [Creek](../characters/creek.md) on the back. This adds to the information about [Vulpes Geex](../characters/vulpes-geex.md) and [the Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s death, offering her [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) as tools to use on the plan that needs putting into motion.

[Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) hands the letter to Marik who reads the plain ink message on the front. Kera plays with one of the three ornate and unique knives on [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md)'s desk, causing her to scold him and tell him to sit down on the other side of the room. This is accompanied by extremely judgemental looks.

[Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) then asks [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) to recite their message. They recite a conversation they witnessed between [Creek](../characters/creek.md) and [Vulpes Geex](../characters/vulpes-geex.md) wherein Geex swears his allegiance to the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md), promising to provide information on what is happening within [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md), particularly in the wake of [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s death. Geex goes one step further, giving [Creek](../characters/creek.md) a "welcoming gift" - word that an inheritor will be travelling to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md)'s [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) following the will reading to retrieve an unknown treasure, possibly [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md).

With all of the information gleaned from [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md), [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) dismisses them, and they leave immediately with no acknowledgement to or by the party.

[Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) then appeals to the party. They tell Kera and Marik that they are needed for an important job, explaining that a member of [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) will be coming to the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) in the next few days to open a lockbox which may contain [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md). [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) explains that they don't care about their debt to [Creek](../characters/creek.md), but if they are able to return the contents of the lockbox to her, she will personally pay them 1,000 gp each. She advises they work together to formulate an ambush plan while they still have time.

The party is given an ornate key ([MC01M-I-1](../cards/MC01M-I-1.md)) by [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) and the location of the lockbox it opens: `JB-305`.

*[Becca](../players/becca.md) and [Sophie](../players/sophie.md) are informed that the remaining hour of the session is to be used for ambush planning. Whatever they plan will be worked into the [MC02](MC02.md) prep so that their characters are introduced to [Rin](../players/rin.md) and [Viktorija](../players/viktorija.md)'s as part of their chosen ambush tactic.*

## Ambush Planning

### [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) Assistance

The skimmers attempt to find other [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) that are willing to help them with the ambush. None are willing to work for less than 20 gp per day, pricing them out.

### Scoping the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md)

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) visit the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) twice over the next few days, using the ornate key to gain access. This gives them insight into the layout, contents, and guard presence of the building, both inside and outside.

On their first visit they locate `JB-305` on the third floor. Marik tries to ascend the stairs one level higher but is told by guards that their lockbox is on the third floor, so she turns back. Kera slowly fills the lockbox with clothes while Marik uses Wild Shape out of sight of the guards to transform into a small spider. She slowly climbs the walls and ceiling, bypassing the guards and getting a view of the largest lock boxes of the top floor. She returns to Kera who empties the locker before the pair leave.

On their second visit, Marik comes with Detect Magic prepared, casting it to look for sword-shaped magical items on the third floor. She finds two that look sword shaped:

| Lockbox | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `GC-901` | *Unknown* |
| `HV-222` | Quarterstaff |

Marik once again Wild Shapes into a spider, climbing through the keyhole of `HV-222`, seeing a quarterstaff. Realising this is not [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md), she opts not to explore the second sword-like lockbox.

### Finding a Vantage Point

At the end of the road, to the right of the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md), the party find [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md) inn. They take up residence here over the next few days, sitting in the tavern area overlooking the street, or staying in their room on the front of the building. From here they are able to observe guard movements and patrons of the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md).

It becomes apparent that the vaults rarely get visitors. Most are aristocratic, wear fine clothes, and are unarmed. As a result the pair decide to put their plan into motion when someone enters the vaults that looks like an adventurer - armour wearing, weapon wielding.

### Formulating a Plan

The pair spend time in their room deciding how they will get the lockbox contents from the [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members who retrieve it. Firstly they agree to let the members get the lockbox contents for them before they ambush them on their exit.

Outside of the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md), [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) will pretend to beat up [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md), stealing a coin purse from her that is conveniently loosely tied to her belt. Kera will then run off in the direction of a nearby alley while Marik shouts to the [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members, appealing to their adventuring nature, hoping they will want to assist her.

If the members pursue Kera, Marik will follow the group into [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) where the skimmers will ambush them. Marik could cast Detect Magic to locate and verify the contents of the lockbox.

### Bribes

The skimmers pay a 5 gp bribe to the [Bay Watch](../organisations/guards/bay-watch.md) guards typically found outside of the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md), making it more likely that on the day that the [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members enter the vaults, they will not be congregated outside.

This will not protect them against other guards in the area that respond to any disturbances.
