## Continuing West

Following the party's fight against the lions, [Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md) insists on continuing west immediately. The party follow her lead without question, depriving them of a break before moving on.

## No Laughing Matter

By late evening while talking to the party while walking, Zolné spots a pack of hyenas following at a distance. She is asked if the party should stop and fight them, but Zolné insists on continuing, explaining that it is better to fight when it isn't so hot.

As the sun sets on the horizon ahead, Zolné declares that now is the time, brandishing her glaive and removing her head wrap. The rest of the party make similar preparations. As Zolné stops and turns to face the hyenas, they break into a charge.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Seven hyenas and two giant hyenas sprint across the desert dunes towards the party.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) casts Entangle on a patch of ground they are running through, catching a regular and giant hyena in tendrils formed out of the sand, bringing them to a stop. The other hyenas run through the now rough terrain, slowing them down somewhat, buying everyone else a chance to attack.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) wastes no time casting Levitate to rise above the sand and out of harm's way.

[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) puts his newly acquired magical skills to the test, casting Fog Cloud in front of the party, creating a cloud that is impossible to see through. This makes it hard for the party to charge or see the attacks coming, but it succeeds in making it hard for the hyenas to see where they are going. They blindly charge forward, attacking the first thing they come across.

The first hyenas arrive at [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md), clashing in fierce battle. Several more arrive at Marik who takes several heavy bites, falling unconscious quickly. Valan runs backwards to keep hyenas in good range of his longbow.

Zolné roars ferociously, scaring three of the hyenas in front of her and Kera. She moves quickly to Marik's aid, fighting the giant hyena that downed her. Vētrall helps her finish it off by casting Cloud of Daggers, ripping it to pieces with daggers that fall from the sky.

By now the ensnared hyenas reach the party, clashing with various people. Valan moves away again, avoiding an attack of opportunity before putting a hyena down with an arrow. Kera moves to Marik, helping Zolné wound the last remaining giant hyena. Vētrall casts Healing Word to revive Marik.

The last two hyenas and giant hyena turn tail and run from where they came, sensing a lost battle. They take off at a pace that cannot be matched. The party strikes at them, including Marik who casts Produce Flame, but they appear to be getting away.

Unwilling to let them go, Valan rains hell on them with his longbow, picking them off one by one, several shots needed to take the giant hyena down. By the time the last one falls it has reached a range of 400 ft, the kill an impressive feat of marksmanship.

*[Initiative order ends]*

As the fight ends Zolné cheers at Valan, declaring him a true warrior. Vētrall is seething that their student has shown them up in this engagement.

## Camping in the Desert

Marik suggests a rest, but Zolné insists they continue west, pointing out that they don't want to be around this many corpses when the vultures arrive. She also tells the party that they will camp for the night as soon as they are clear. The party agrees, following Zolné for 30 minutes before camping for the night.

Zolné sits herself down in the sand, the rest of the party following her lead, pulling out sleeping bags and blankets. Zolné begins to wrap her head even more thoroughly, preparing for a bitterly cold desert night.

Zolné takes the opportunity to ask the party "what their stories are", wanting to learn who they are and what brought them to the desert.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) reveal that they were hired to steal something from the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md), and that [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) was the target that matched the description of what they expected - an armed adventuring type that looked like a member of [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md). When angrily confronted by Vētrall, the pair refuse to reveal what precisely they were looking to steal, Marik stopping Kera from saying so.

Kera attempts to reclaim the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md)' credibility, rebutting Vētrall's accusations of them being thieves by pointing out that he has honoured his agreement with them that he won't steal from either Vētrall or Valan. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) then thanks Vētrall for saving Marik's life for the third time, giving them his [Dust of Disappearance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/dust-of-disappearance) as thanks, explaining what it does. Vētrall thanks him, showing the first signs of respect for their new travelling companions.

[Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md) asks how the party found themselves in the desert. Collectively the party recant their scuffle in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md), the out of place guards they fought, suddenly finding themselves on a wall, and then waking up in the desert before passing out and finding themselves in [Dune's House](../places/buildings/houses/dunes-house.md). The story makes little sense to Zolné who attempts to rationalise and dismiss it as a drug fuelled fever dream of some kind. The party assure her that their story is real, despite their lack of explanations.

While all of this conversation is happening, [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) goes back to his knitting, annoyed at the sand that has made its way into all of his wool. Kera and Marik ask about his knitting, but Valan gets defensive about his hobby.

*[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md):*
> Sometimes I knit, sometimes I kill.

Zolné compliments his knitting skills, pointing out that hands so skilled in archery must make the finest wool garments.

As the party beds down for the night, Zolné and Valan take watches, but the night is quiet.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## A Storm in the Dunes

The following day the party continue following [Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md) west. Around the middle of the day Zolné is about to crest a sand dune when she drops to the floor suddenly, prompting everyone to stop moving. She shuffles up to the crest of the dune on her belly to take a better look.

The party ask what she sees. She explains that there is a dust devil. Everyone follows her lead, dropping to the sand and scooting to the crest to observe what she describes. They see a small tornado of sand dancing through a trough between dunes, moving perpendicular to their direction of travel.

Zolné explains that dust devils are dangerous beings, sand given life. The party muses over how sand can possess life and the notion of life that does not have flesh, but [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) is confident that Zolné is telling the truth, pointing out that many strange things that they do not know must exist in the world. Zolné recants tales warning of the danger of dust devils, noting that she knows nobody that fought one and lived to tell the tale.

She advises the party change their route to circumvent it. Everyone adopts a low and stealthy stance, giving it a wide berth to the south before continuing west. Fortunately the dust devil does not notice them.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## Reaching the Trail

On the following morning, [Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md) leads the party west once again. She spots a mound of stones in the distance, pointing it out to the party. They make their way over to it, Zolné finding a rock with the number 12 etched into it. She explains that this is a route marker on the trade route between [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) and the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) settlements to the south, and that the number counts up each mound, starting at [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md).

She tells the party that they should reach the town by nightfall, much to the relief of everyone, Valan in particular. They are excited at the prospect of finding an inn for a drink before parting ways, looking to catch a ride on a ship to their respective homes.

Continuing to follow the mounds north, the party eventually spots two figures on what appear to be horses, cresting over a distant dune. They are followed by two more horses. Zolné suggests that they are traders. As they get closer, it becomes apparent that it is two people on camels, with two more camels loaded with goods in tow.

Zolné flags them down with her glaive, waving it as an extension of her arm. They wave back. When they arrive she greets them in a friendly manner, informing them that they are on their way to [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md). The traders explain that they are on their way to Ouvraux, the next settlement along the trading route.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md), frustrated by how bloody and sandy their clothes are, asks if they are selling clothes. The traders explain that they are trading textiles, but Vētrall is dismayed to find that they are only trading in rolls of raw material, not finished garments.

Continuing on, by late afternoon the party crest a large dune and lay eyes on [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) for the first time, a welcome sight for the weary party. Valan is dismayed that there is no lush green vegetation, seeing only sand that meets the sea, indicating that the town will still be desert-like.

[Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md) declares that this is where she parts ways with the party as the town is no place for her. The party thank her for everything she has done for her, but she tells them that it was her pleasure. She is honest in telling them that she is surprised they survived the desert. When [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) engages her in conversation, Zolné declares him an idiot, which he takes well. The party make their way towards [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) while Zolné turns around and makes her way back in the direction she came.

## A Republic Checkpoint

Noticing the start of the main road that runs along the length of [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md), the party head towards it. On arrival they look down the street to see a [Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) checkpoint several buildings down, comprised of two lead guards and two flanking groups of four regular guards. One of the lead guards waves his hand at the party. Hesitating for a moment, nobody recognises the uniforms, and so everyone agrees to proceed over to them.

Once at the guards, one of the lead guards informs the party that this is a "Republic checkpoint" and that they need to search their equipment. Vētrall challenges their authority, but the lead guards are quick to retort that they are upholding the law here.Everyone hesitantly complies. Vētrall remains nervous, secretly worried about the [memory sphere](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) in their possession.

Valan notices that one of the guards is a dark elf ([Grouper](../characters/grouper.md)), giving him a dirty look. He doesn't acknowledge it.

The guards make the following remarks as they search through the party's gear:

| Character | Remarks |
| --- | --- |
| [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) | Well supplied. |
| [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) | Finds her Potion of Diminution intriguing. |
| [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) | Packing for the wrong weather. |

When a guard pulls out [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md)'s lead lined chest and opens it up to reveal the [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md), he calls out to one of the lead guards who then barks an order at his guards. Suddenly the party is surrounded by guards with their spears drawn towards them. Everyone is shocked and confused.

*[Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md):*
> You're all under arrest for the smuggling and possession of an ancient artifact.

As the guards close in and begin to prepare manacles to restrain the party, chaos erupts.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) begins to get violent with the two guards that grab his arms. The second lead guard casts Sleep on him while pointing his fingers at him, causing Kera to pass out and drop to the ground with a thud.

[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) and [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) begin shouting about not having done anything wrong, getting increasingly loud and irate. The first lead guard casts Silence on them, causing their voices to disappear. This doesn't deter Vētrall who continues to shout while being placed in manacles, their face a picture of anger and frustration despite the quiet.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) has manacles slipped onto her before she uses Wild Shape to turn into a cat. She wiggles free of a manacle around the hind portion of her torso, running down the street in a desperate bid for freedom. Two guards throw their spears at her, one hitting her rear, causing her Wild Shape to be dropped. As she returns to being a goliath she continues to run, darting left into a side street.

Her luck gets worse as she turns the corner to meet four more [Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) who were making their way to the commotion. She prepares to Wild Shape again but is hit with two more spears, knocking her unconscious.

Kera is picked up by two guards who drag him by his shoulders. Marik's unconscious body emerges from [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) in the hands of more guards. Valan goes willingly while Vētrall kicks and screams, eventually having to be carried by two guards on each end.

## Thrown in Jail

The party is taken back to the [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) [Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) jail and thrown in a rectangular cell with bars along its long side and a high up squat window on the opposite side. A corridor runs parallel to the bars, disappearing out of sight on both sides. All of their possessions except their armour and clothes have been taken.

The unconscious [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) are set down in the cell and unshackled. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) are also set down. As Valan is being unshackled he attempts to struggle free, causing another guard to rush into the cell and help pin him down again, getting the shackles back on. Valan is punched in the face while Vētrall is punched in the stomach, discouraging the pair to resist any further. Vētrall's shackles are removed. Valan is able to sit up against the wall, hands shackled behind his back.

Valan questions what the [memory sphere](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) is. Vētrall is honest in their answers, explaining that they went to the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) to retrieve a gift from [the Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md), and that this mysterious orb was within. They explain that Geen had no idea what it was, but said to keep it safe. The pair also discuss their [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) companions and what to make of their plot to steal from Vētrall, wondering how much they could know.

After an hour [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) wakes. He accuses Vētrall and Valan of being hypocrites who gave Marik and him grief for being thieves but who have landed them all in jail over theft. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) wakes up around an hour later. Heated discussions focus around what the [memory sphere](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) is and why the guards would be so interested in it. Vētrall's lack of knowledge on it or why they have it proves unsatisfactory to all involved.

Vētrall doesn't take being in jail well, spending lots of time shouting at/for the guards, proclaiming their innocence and demanding to know why they've been arrested, and how long they can expect to be here. The guards down the corridor to the right eventually tire of their protestations. One comes over to them at the bars and hits them with his club, telling them in [elvish](../languages/elvish.md) to be quiet before wandering off.

*[Long rest]*

## Paper Through the Window

By morning the party receives for breakfast bowls of potato and oats in porridge form. Everyone quietly eats their slop, Vētrall having to feed Valan with a spoon. Valan finds this incredibly undignified and Vētrall revels in the embarrassment, but both work together to ensure he is fed.

After a few hours, a rolled up scrap of paper ([MC03-L-1](../letters/MC03-L-1.md)) is thrown through the window, landing in the middle of the floor. Nobody hears the source of the paper or sees anything when they look to the window. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) gets to it first, unrolling it to find it blank. Understanding that it likely has invisible ink written on it, Marik regrets having unprepared the Detect Magic spell that morning.

## Marik Escapes

Kera encourages Marik to try and escape by using Wild Shape to transform into a spider again. She is reluctant at first but eventually caves. Marik turns into a spider.

Marik walks under the bottom of the metal bars and into the corridor. She notices that the corridor to the left is eventually a dead end, several more identical jail cells running along the same side of the wall. To her right is one more jail cell before the corridor turns left out of sight. At this corner she sees two [Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) sat on chairs enjoying a game with playing cards.

She climbs up the wall and onto the ceiling, trying to scuttle past the guards unnoticed into the corridor beyond the corner. One of the guard spots her in his peripheral vision, pointing out the spider to the other. The pair begin to ready their playing cards to flick at the spider. The guard that noticed her hits her with the first playing card, knocking her straight to the floor.

Marik persists in the same direction for a moment, causing the guard to question this spider's behaviour. Realising that one of the prisoners can transform into beasts, he shouts at the other guard in [elvish](../languages/elvish.md) that it's her, catching Vētrall and Valan's ears. As the guard stands up, Marik turns back around and heads back towards her cell. The guard tries to squash Marik underfoot but misses. Marik is able to flee back into her cell before the guards can raise the alarm. Once there she heads up the wall and escapes out of the window before a guard can find the keys and open the cell door.

Now on the other side of the wall, Marik can see that the prison is right on the coast, waves gently lapping at the foundations of the building below. She climbs onto the flat adobe roof where she rests for a moment, getting her bearings. From here she can see that the prison is half way along the town. She moves closer to the edge, observing [Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) moving out into the streets, searching for her.

Marik climbs down the prison wall into the street outside of the front door. Here she is found by a pair of guards who shout that they've found her. She dives behind a wooden crate on the opposite side of the street, hoping not to be found. The lead guard emerges from the building and casts Dispel Magic on her, transforming her back into a goliath. She is swiftly captured and put back in manacles.

Taken back to her jail cell she is beaten severely in front of everyone else, punched multiple times in the stomach and face before being thrown onto the floor of the cell. She is left in her manacles.

Following her escape attempt, four [Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) are posted outside of the jail cell, watching the party. After a few hours they move off to either side of the corridor, intentionally standing just out of sight.

During the afternoon both Valan and Vētrall overhear the guards talking in [elvish](../languages/elvish.md) about [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) arriving tomorrow, noting that it is late, and its arrival will require the presence of many of the guards, disrupting the usual guard shifts. The pair do not realise that [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) is a ship, only figuring that it is a name for something.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## Reading the Paper

In the morning, [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) looks to help [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) free herself from her shackles so that she can attempt to cast Detect Magic on the roll of blank paper ([MC03-L-1](../letters/MC03-L-1.md)).

Kera tries to pull the manacles chain apart, feeling the metal in one of the links bend slightly. He tries again, pulling them apart with a loud metal breaking sound. This begins to attract the attention of the guards who move to see what is going on. Kera gets up and bangs on the bars, shouting loudly to provide a distraction.

In the meanwhile, Marik casts Detect Magic on the note, reading what it says before putting it and her hands behind her back to hide the broken chains. A guard approaches the cell, only seeing Kera causing trouble. He smacks Kera on the nose with a club.

Marik, dismayed by the note, explains that she thought it might be an offer of help, but instead it appears to be a threat of death. She resigns herself to her fate in the cell.

## An Assassin in the Jail Cell

The sound of a large low pitched horn can be heard blowing, followed by the frequent ringing of a large metal bell. The two guards stationed towards the end of the corridor leave immediately, crossing the line of sight of the party.

After a few moments more, a guard appears from down the corridor, speaking to the two remaining guards in [elvish](../languages/elvish.md), telling them that they are needed. The party can hear the guards leaving the corridor. This new guard then moves into view and stares. [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) hurls insults at him, threatening him with violence.

The guard smirks and draws a shortsword before casting Disguise Self, becoming a brown skinned goliath. He casts Misty Step, disappearing briefly before appearing in the cell, brandishing his blade in Valan's direction.

*[Initiative order begins]*

The would-be assassin lunges at Valan, still in manacles. He gets several stabs in, bringing Valan to the brink of death. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) tries to cast Hideous Laughter but the spell fails to take. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) casts Produce Flame, scorching the assassin's face and burning off his eyebrows.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) grabs the assassin in a grapple, pulling him to the opposite side of the cell. In doing so the assassin turns his blade on him, puncturing him several times. Marik hits him with Produce Flame while in Kera's hands while Vētrall casts Vicious Mockery to knock him unconscious.

*[Initiative order ends]*

As the assassin falls to the floor, his Disguise Self spell ends, revealing that his original form was that of the guard, not the goliath.

## Making a Break For It

Hearing the commotion of guards from a room beyond the corridor, the party act fast to see if an escape attempt is possible. Valan searches the body, finding:

- Shortsword
- Hand crossbow
- Crossbow bolt case
- 4 crossbow bolts
- 2 sp 4 cp
- A key to the jail cell

Kera takes the shortsword while Valan pockets the crossbow and ammo. Vētrall takes the key, unlocking the door to the cell. As they do, two guards round the corner, ready to strike.

*[Initiative order begins]*

The narrow corridor means that the guards approach [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) in single file. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) moves behind Vētrall, throwing a ball of Produce Flame fire over their shoulder, impacting the first guard. As the guard approaches Vētrall moves forward casting Blindness on the first guard. Nonetheless the guard approaches, bumping into Vētrall before taking a lucky stab with his spear, puncturing Vētrall.

Meanwhile [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) runs in the opposite direction, only finding a dead end. [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) follows him, shouting for him to cut his manacles. Kera takes a heavy swing with the shortsword down onto the taut chain, breaking it in a single motion. Valan readies his crossbow.

Vētrall and Marik make short work of the second guard, knocking him unconscious. The blinded guard continues to be affected by the spell. Hearing his ally fall to the ground and the sound of multiple prisoners ahead, he turns tail and runs, almost tripping over his ally before running along the corridor. Upon meeting the corner, he runs clean into the wall, knocking the last of the life out of him, falling unconscious.

*[Initiative order ends]*

The party collect the spears, arming themselves. They tentatively make their way around the corner and into the next room, finding a room with benches and a wall of square slots for storing gear. Here they immediately recognise their own gear and weapons leaning nearby. They re-equip their gear, leaving the guard's armaments behind.

Vētrall hurriedly checks for the lead lined chest, finding it with the [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md) still inside. Relieved, they pocket the chest and get ready to move out.

Marik checks the next room, finding a completely empty reception area. The party see their opportunity and run for the door, heading out into the street beyond. It is a side street that runs perpendicular to the main road, one street over.

Looking both left and right, they see a patrol of [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) coming from a side street to the right, some way down the road. They briefly look around before continuing in their direction, disappearing into an alley that leads to the main road.

The party heads left, breaking into a jog. As they cross one of the side streets they look towards the main road, seeing a patrol of [Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) come face to face with a patrol of [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md), both groups stopping for a moment to converse. The party use the moment to cross the street, avoiding their gaze.

## Collected by [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md)

As the party continue down the street, a wooden door to a humble building between the street and the main road opens. A dark elf ([Grouper](../characters/grouper.md)) pokes his head out, ushering the party inside. Valan immediately recognises this as the dark elf [Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md), but now they are only wearing a drab sandy coloured robe.

Once inside, [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) closes the door, removing most of the light from the room. It is a room used for dying fabric, with piles of fabric and buckets of coloured water piled up around the room and on several wooden tables. A washing line crosses the room diagonally, on which a large length of damp red fabric sits, dripping slowly onto the straw floor.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) moves swiftly to the other side of the room, climbing onto a box to look through a small road-level opening high up on the wall. He pulls open the slats, peering left and right into the street before closing it again and rejoining the party.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) starts by addressing [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md).

*[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md):*
> Well, you two are certainly in a lot of trouble.

He introduces himself to the group before explaining that the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) believe the pair have gone rogue, having disappeared mysteriously from [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) during their mission. [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) points out how unexpected but fortuitous it is that they appeared in "his town", a situation he plans to take advantage of.

He informs Kera and Marik that the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) have placed a 5,000 gp bounty on each of them for their deserting, a sum he could collect himself if he so wished. [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) and [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) see this as proof that Kera and Marik are bad news.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) asks Vētrall if they have "the box". Vētrall doesn't trust [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md), only giving a vague "yes". When [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) asks to see its contents, [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) refuses. He points out to the pair that they are implicated in Marsh Skimmer business now - it is known that they were present with Kera and Marik before everyone disappeared. He also makes it clear that the assassin was sent by his hand, is not dead, and that it is no coincidence that the sphere was still in Vētrall's bag & the jail devoid of guards.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) offers Kera and Marik a lifeline. He explains that if they go back to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) to "complete their mission", he will be able to pull some strings to convince many of the Marsh Skimmer contacts that they have been brought back into the fold. Marik asks what is so significant about their mission that [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) would be willing to do that.

Trying to explain events without giving away the whole truth, [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) tells Vētrall and Valan that Kera and Marik were tasked with stealing the contents of [the Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s strongbox in the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md), whatever it may be. [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) asks Vētrall if they have [Unevaire](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/weapons/unevaire.md). Vētrall says no. Kera and Marik are mortified, understanding that their mission was to retrieve the legendary sword, but missing the nuance of [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md)'s orders that the sword would be the *best outcome* of their mission.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) plainly tells Vētrall to show him the sphere. Vētrall complies, pulling it from the lead lined box, but refusing to give it to [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) to hold. [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) tells the group that this may well be the most valuable item he has ever laid his eyes on, wildly speculating that the sphere may be worth 500,000 gp to 1,000,000 gp to the right buyer, particularly a collector of ancient artifacts.

Vētrall asks what the sphere is. [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) only says that it is an ancient artifact from [Oonar](../planes/oonar.md), the plane that everyone originated from prior to [the Second Coming](../history/events/the-second-coming.md) and Third Coming. He says that it is most likely an item from Chausain, the elven city that all [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md) elves came here from. That makes the artifact over 3,000 years old.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) explains that the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) will want the artifact, as they see themselves as direct descendants of the Elves of Chausain culture and way of life. To them, artifacts like this are part of their ancestral heritage. He tells the party that he has no intention of seeing this sphere in the hands of the Syntenne, nor does he want [Creek](../characters/creek.md) or [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) to possess it, as he has no love for them. He points out that from what he has been told, the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) had no idea what exactly was in the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md), so they certainly weren't expecting to receive such an artifact and would likely just be disappointed to learn that it wasn't [Unevaire](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/weapons/unevaire.md).

He goes on to tell the party that he feels that a greater force is at play here, and it is not for him to stop the party. Secretly [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) is guided by [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) through his faith for her.

## Thrown a Bone

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) offers the party a way out of [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md). He points out that [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) docked yesterday. [Captain Gill](../characters/clef-gill.md) informed the [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) that there was disease aboard and the ship was to be quarantined, which was done. Secretly this disease doesn't exist, used as cover for [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) infiltrators aboard who intend to destroy the town's defences as a precursor to a larger naval attack - something his spies in the town have learned through whispers with what remains of the original crew. The ship was boarded on the Kavallos Sea while en route here.

He tells them that the party would be able to ingratiate themselves with the arch-mage of [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md), [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md), if they bring this information to her, or help defend the town from the attack. [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) retrieves a Kavallos longsword from under a pile of cloth on a table, presenting it to the party. He tells them of the sword's origin and explains that it should provide proof of what they say. When Vētrall asks where he retrieved the sword, he brushes the question off by saying that "he has his ways".

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) also points out that the party could sneak onto another ship when it eventually arrives, or trek through the Reime Jungle to the north if they wished. Neither idea sounds appealing, so they begin to formulate a plan.

Eventually they settle on speaking to the arch-mage directly in the hopes of offering their services in defence of the town. They will ask for [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) as payment, which they will then sail north towards their respective homes.

## Meeting the Arch-mage

The party make their way to [Tour de la Côte](../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md), finding a set of steps leading to the main entrance, two [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards flanking either side wielding greataxes. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) steps up, asking to speak with the arch-mage urgently, explaining that there is a plot that threatens the town related to [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md). [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) reveals the sword, piquing the curiosity of one of the guards, who grants an audience.

He leads the party inside, through the ground floor to the spiral staircase, ascending five floors to the arch-mage's chamber. Here the party see a large relatively empty room with glass windows on the opposite side that overlook the sea. At a large marble table sits [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md), writing delicately in a large book.

The guard gets the attention of the arch-mage who finishes what she is writing before acknowledging anyone. She slowly pushes out her chair and stands, making sure that her dress falls across her lower half correctly before stepping out from behind the desk.

Oriel asks the party what news they bring her. Collectively they explain that [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) contains [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) spies who intend to destroy the town's defences as the precursor to a larger attack. Kera once again shows the Kavallos longsword.

Oriel is troubled by this news, explaining that she knows [Captain Gill](../characters/clef-gill.md) well and therefore worries for his safety. She tells the party that [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) is a regular trade ship that comes into [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) like clockwork, providing vital food supplies that sustains the town. A lack of regular food deliveries is just as much of a concern to her as the prospect of open conflict with the fleet.

Moving over to the window and inviting the party to do the same, Oriel points down at [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) in the harbour, using a more powerful version of Dancing Lights to create large sun-like ball of light above the ship briefly, using it as a marker to draw the party's attention. She then does the same to the south/left, illuminating a spot above the sea wall. Many of the party members spot the large cannons along the top of the wall, with guards posted at each one. Oriel points out that these are their likely target.

When the party try to convince Oriel to reposition guards to the fortifications she gently refuses, making it clear that the party have little proof, so she won't jeopardise the work the Unicorn Guard are doing elsewhere. She will however allow the party to help in any way they can, suggesting they either guard the ship or the fortifications.

Kera points out that the spies may already be ashore, so it would be best to guard the fortifications directly. Oriel agrees. She tells the party that if what they say is true and they are able to defend the town, they will have her personal favour.

The party thank her for her time and begin to leave the [Tour de la Côte](../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md).
