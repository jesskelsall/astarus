## Choosing a Military Organisation

The [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) players decided to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md).

Heading back to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), the party convince the guards to let them inside so they can accept [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md)'s offer of joining the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md). The party enter the [Zenith Spire](../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md) where Levelle confirm their intention to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) as a new squad of [Astorrel Squad Hands](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md).

The party accepts this offer, beginning their three weeks of training.

## Learning the Ways of the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md)

The party is handed over to [Ludolf Hornwallis](../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md) who is in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) on business at a coincidental time. He explains that as an [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) mentor, he will be conducting the party's training. Even with his level of experience, he finds the circumstances around the party joining the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) to be almost unheard of, and three weeks is definitely not enough time to learn the entire curriculum, but he does his best. Typically trainees take 2-4 years to complete their training.

### History

Ludolf teaches the party about [Astarus](../celestial-objects/astarus.md), [South East Kardan](../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md), the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), as well as their taught histories.

### Religion

Ludolf teaches the party about [the Order of the Diamond](../organisations/the-order-of-the-diamond.md) and the religion's pantheon of [gods](../gods/gods.md): [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md), [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md), [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md), and [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md).

### Nature

Confined to a classroom, Ludolf improvises lessons about nature: spotting issues, handling issues, and how it all relates to [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md)'s teachings.

### Persuasion

Finally Ludolf teaches the party about how to persuade the local populace to do as the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) requires, particularly when they need to stop a course of action to preserve nature.

### [Astorrel Training Skill](../mechanics/skills/astorrel-training.md)

Each character having rolled a skill check for each of the above skills, the lowest roll is taken to form the basis of each character's [Astorrel Training skill](../mechanics/skills/astorrel-training.md) bonus modifier.

| Character | History | Religion | Nature | Perception | *Lowest* | **Modifier** |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | 21 | 15 | 19 | 20 | *15* | **+0** |
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | 7 | 14 | 13 | 24 | *7* | **-2** |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | 11 | 18 | 9 | 3 | *3* | **-4** |
| [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) | 1 | 6 | 12 | 12 | *1* | **-5** |

## Graduation

### Graduation Pledge

The party are told that they need to go to [Diamond Prime](../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md) and pledge themselves to an insider god of their choosing in order to graduate. This step is a show of worship of [the Order of the Diamond](../organisations/the-order-of-the-diamond.md). Each character makes their choice (authentic or not) and goes to make their pledge.

| Character | God |
| --- | --- |
| [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md) |
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) |
| [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) | [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) |

### A Secret Step...

[Ludolf Hornwallis](../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md) leads the party down into the tunnels below the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) for their next graduation task. He arrives at a door that leads out into a large chamber - the [Northhaven Astorrel Arena](../places/buildings/northhaven-astorrel-arena.md).

Here the party finds [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md), [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) and four unknown robed [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md). Ludolf explains that the higher ups would like a demonstration of the party's abilities before they graduate, and that a combat challenge has been prepared for them.

### Combat Challenge

The party take their positions in the lower main area of the arena, awaiting its start. One of the robed [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) suddenly teleports to the heavy door, removes the bolt, drops it to the ground, then teleports back to the raised area. As the door swings open, two tigers emerge, followed by a giant spider which is clinging to the wall.

*[Initiative order begins]*

As the tigers emerge, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Spike Growth in the doorway, proving exceptionally dangerous to the tigers which stubbornly run through the sharp ground, ripping their feet as they go.

[Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) casts Ray of Enfeeblement on the first tiger she sees, doing very little. After they cross the spiked ground, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) charges at the closest tiger, attacking it with her halberd.

As the spider climbs around the tigers in the doorway, [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) casts Magic Missile against it. Saoirse follows that up by casting Mind Spike on it, dealing enough damage to knock it unconscious. It releases its grip from the wall, falling to the floor. As it goes it returns to its pre-polymorph form - a boulder, which slams into the ground with force, the sound echoing around the room.

The giant scorpion hiding inside the small room beyond the door emerges, also trekking through [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s Spike Growth. It emerges having taken relatively little damage.

The party concentrates their efforts on the tigers. Thanea casts Ray of Frost to prevent their advance, while [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Ice Knife which misses. The closest tiger engages with Torbra while the other succumbs to its wounds while moving through the spiky terrain.

Torbra swings again at the first tiger, piercing its jugular with her halberd. As it slumps to the ground it turns back into a boulder which inherits the tiger's momentum, causing it to roll onto Torbra, pinching her between it and the ground.

Now only the giant scorpion remains. It pushes on through the spiky terrain, bee-lining for the three party members who are casting from range. As it does so, two of the robed [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) cast polymorph on the rocks again, turning the second tiger and the giant scorpion rocks back into their animal forms.

Thanea reacts by casting Witch Bolt on the giant scorpion while [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) hits it with an Ice Knife. Torbra charges at it with her halberd, cracking through its chitinous exoskeleton, killing it. Once again a boulder threatens to roll onto Torbra, but this time she escapes in time.

Meanwhile the tiger charges at Thanea, missing with its charging claw attack. Thanea retaliates by blasting it with Scorching Ray which only makes it angrier at her. The tiger misses in its frustration.

Saoirse sends an Eldritch Blast toward the giant spider, hitting it with a critical. It shakes it off, running along the ground before shooting its web at [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), encasing her and preventing her from doing much. It doesn't take long for [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) to struggle free of the spider web. Torbra charges across the arena to the spider and once again fells a creature with a charging halberd attack. As it transforms back into a boulder, Torbra is once again hurt by it rolling onto her.

Saoirse launches another Eldritch Blast, now at the final creature, the tiger. Thanea attempts a Fire Bolt but misses before fleeing, the tiger swiping her as she moves. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) attempts to bonk it with her staff, only causing it to send its claws her way. Torbra charges in for the kill but doesn't quite finish the tiger off.

When Thanea tries to hit the tiger with another Fire Bolt, her natural 1 causes the attack to hit [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) instead who is next to the tiger. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) bonks the tiger again using Shillelagh, causing it to pass out - and transform back into a boulder. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) dives out of the way as it falls on Torbra.

*[Initiative order ends]*

With the third rock crushing Torbra, she gets pissed off and begins to grow, ascending to 12ft tall (Giant's Might) before grabbing the boulder and throwing it towards the wall. It lands short, rolling before impacting the wall, doing damage to both floor and wall.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> Well that's new.

The party is dumbfounded at the sudden growth of Torbra.

*[[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) unlocks the ability to use Giant's Might at will]*

### Graduation Ceremony

Still inside the [Northhaven Astorrel Arena](../places/buildings/northhaven-astorrel-arena.md), [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md), [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md), and [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) join [Ludolf Hornwallis](../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md) and the party to complete their graduation. They are all impressed at the party's capabilities, particularly [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) who neutralised the encounter, and Torbra whose growth is an unprecedented ability to those who witnessed it.

Levelle produces four [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) badges before asking the party if they've selected their [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad name. They state that they've picked [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md). Elysia sarcastically remarks that the name is quite on the nose. Levelle pins the badges on each person, signifying their new rank within the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md).

### Invited to [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md)

Next Levelle produces a letter for the party ([L-PR-03](../letters/L-PR-03.md)), secured with a grey wax seal stamped with the symbol of the [Astornar](../organisations/government/astornar.md).

The party are keen to compete, for various reasons: attending a festival sounds fun, the opportunity to kick some ass, and the prize money.

### Elysia's Promotion

While the party is discussing the potential of taking part in the tournament, [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) approaches [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md), taking off her [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) badge and replacing it with an [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) badge (promoting her), before congratulating her.

It dawns on the party that Elysia will be their superior officer. Saoirse grins at her.

*[Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> You're stuck with us now!

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> I'm not the one that's stuck. I'm going places.

Elysia tells the group that their work together will begin in earnest, either the following day or after the end of the [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) tournament, if they decide to accept the offer.
