## [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) Head to [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md)

On the first day of the [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md) tournament, [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) walk down the street of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), heading toward the [Zenith Spire](../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md) where they have been told to congregate. They meet [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) and [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) who are standing with [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md), who they do not know.

Levelle greets them, informing them that the other two squads ([Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md)) have already made their way to [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md). Levelle, Mergin and Bryce step into the teleportation circle drawn onto the pavement, which most of the party recognise as arcane symbols. Mergin asks [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) to step into [the circle](../places/buildings/the-circle.md). Levelle waves to the crowd of hundreds as Mergin slams his staff against the ground, teleporting them into the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) Stronghold.

The city immediately feels more humid. They arrive on the third floor of the stronghold with a tall ceiling and thin tall windows looking out over the cramped and vertical city of [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md). The room is filled with groups of adventurer looking types as well as a stage at the far end with [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) officials gathered at its edges.

## Welcome to the Tournament

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) are already here, having arrived minutes prior via the same means. They are getting their bearings, recognising faces from their training cohort, when [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) higher-ups appear with a flash of light.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) immediately starts looking for someone with abs on display. She hears and then sees [Reozin Ironhide](../characters/reozin-ironhide.md) across the room, chatting boisterously to his squad ([Mortar squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md)). [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) hears the same laugh and recognises them as an old pit fighting buddy from [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md). Saoirse remarks to her squad that she hopes not to have to fight them.

Ahsha goes over to Reozin and says hi, the pair immediately reconnecting with playful fighting talk. Reozin explains that he got bored of winning every pit fight and so turned his hand to becoming a member of the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). They speak of their respective squads, Reozin describing [Mortar squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) as the "prize of [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md)", which Ahsha jokingly belittles. The pair look forward to an opportunity to fight in the arena. A confrontational hug is exchanged with plenty of posturing. Ahsha gives him a gentle punch to the chest before leaving him be.

Ahsha sees Reozin go back to talking to [Diarmuid Kavanagh](../characters/diarmuid-kavanagh.md) and [Aisling Kavanagh](../characters/aisling-kavanagh.md), the latter shooting her a dirty look, which doesn't bother her.

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) look around for [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) but don't see her anywhere.

The tournament officials begin to congregate around the stage. Calls to be quiet propagate around the room as the chatter dies down. [Liabella Peacock](../characters/liabella-peacock.md) emerges onto the stage wearing her best [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) ceremonial armour.

*[Liabella Peacock](../characters/liabella-peacock.md):*
> My esteemed guests, welcome to [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md). It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 28th [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) tournament.

She welcomes everyone and expresses her gratitude for each squad accepting her invite. She begins by giving a high level explanation of how the tournament works. She trips in her speech slightly when accidentally mentioning previous tournament deaths when putting a fine point on the "no killing" rule.

Liabella passes over to [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) who gives specifics of the rules. She also explains the layout of the arena with its centrally located wall that provides cover. A fine point is put on the knockout rule that forbids people from attacking those who are unconscious otherwise their team is immediately disqualified. She also explains the [Astorrel members](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) who will be providing aid as well as the victory conditions.

Levelle opens the floor to questions.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) asks whether individuals are knocked out of the tournament. Levelle explains that a team win or lose together, so even if one person wins the match, the entire team advances to the next round. She also points out that each round of the tournament takes place on a different day of the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival, so there will be time to recuperate between each match.

*[As a DM I provide further rule clarifications out of character.]*  
*See: [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md)*

With all questions answered, [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) takes centre stage for a brief moment.

*[Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md):*
> Hi everyone, I'm [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md). On behalf of the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) I'd like to welcome you all here.

[Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) resumes center stage and announces that the bracket draws will now take place. She is provided a box filled with balls, each with the name of a competing squad on them. She draws them in pairs, announcing the first round of matches as she goes.

| First Ball | Second Ball |
| --- | --- |
| [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) | [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) |
| [Komodo Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) | [Birch Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/birch-squad.md) |
| [Mortar Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) | [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) |
| [Gloom Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md) | [Horizon Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/horizon-squad.md) |

As each ball is drawn, that squad feels the eyes of every other competitor in the room on them.

When [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) are drawn together, both squads react with a mix of excitement and embarrassment. The rest of the room begins gossiping due to the two Cities / [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) squads being drawn against each other. It is already rare for two squads from the same part of the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) to be taking part, let alone fighting each other.

As [Mortar squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) is announced, [Reozin Ironhide](../characters/reozin-ironhide.md) roars to make his presence known, catching everyone's attention. [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) are then matched with them.

With that, Liabella wishes everyone good luck, asking everyone to put on a good show and make the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) proud. She makes it clear that the first round of matches will begin that evening, so everyone is free to enjoy the food and drink provided in the room until then.

## Pre-Tournament Socialising

As the stage clears, a variety of high ranking military people mingle with the competitors and each other:

| Character | Rank | Division | Tournament Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Liabella Peacock](../characters/liabella-peacock.md) | [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) General | | Co-organiser |
| [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) | [Astorrel Commandant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md) | | Co-organiser |
||
| [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) | [Astorrel Captain](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-captain.md) | Cities / [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) | Host city captain |
| [Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md) | [Astornox Captain](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-captain.md) | Settlements / [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) | Host city captain |
||
| [Itharmund Steeleye](../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) | [Astornox Commandant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-commandant.md) | | Guest |
| [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) | [Astorrel Captain](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-captain.md) | Cities / [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) | Guest |
| [Tamosha Goldron](../characters/tamosha-goldron.md) | [Astorrel Captain](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-captain.md) | Cities / [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md) | Guest |

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) immediately hunts for booze, finding an open bar staffed by an [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md). When asking for their strongest drink she receives a glass of white wine, insisting it is filled to the lip. Having lost track of [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) she downs her drink as she walks off. She walks into someone and spills half of her drink down the side of [Tamosha Goldron](../characters/tamosha-goldron.md)'s [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) officer's robes. They utter a rude "excuse me?" to Saoirse who immediately apologises and shrinks off into the crowd.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) goes up to [Mortar squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md), [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) following her. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) sights the blue firbolg ([Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)) that [Ludolf Hornwallis](../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md) spoke of training and follows her over, watching from a distance. Reozin opens with fighting talk.

*[Reozin Ironhide](../characters/reozin-ironhide.md):*
> Ready to get beaten?

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) answers dimly to his repeated fighting talk, causing him to quickly get bored of her.  [Aisling Kavanagh](../characters/aisling-kavanagh.md) utters a plain "hello?" at [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). [Diarmuid Kavanagh](../characters/diarmuid-kavanagh.md) scrunches up his face at the sight of strangers. [Yoroe Briskboots](../characters/yoroe-briskboots.md) grins at [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), sheepishly declaring her tall. Aisling points out that while Reozin may be blunt, they very much intend to beat [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), making calm and pointed fighting talk of her own. Torbra gets annoyed at the tone of her voice, taking issue with their rudeness rather than their fighting talk. Aisling points out her boredom at being stuck in a room of try-hards.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) resets their conversation, beginning a round of pleasant introductions. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) recants [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s journey into the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), to which Aisling admits she knows of them already. She begrudgingly reciprocates the formal introductions, introducing the rest of [Mortar squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md).

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) grabs a drink before going to speak with [Morgan Caithness](../characters/morgan-caithness.md) about their upcoming match.

## Ephaine Caught Watching

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) feel eyes on them, turning to find [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) staring at them from a distance awkwardly. She mumbles an apology, explaining that her mentor [Ludolf Hornwallis](../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md) knows them and she just wanted to see what they were about. She excuses herself and walks off. Nobody stops her.

## The Gambling Captains

[Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) spots three [Astorrel captains](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-captain.md) circled in conversation talking about coin, pricking up her ears. They are discussing a wager over which of their entered [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads will win the tournament.

*[Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md):*
> So! We've all got squads underneath us that are taking part. Anyone for a friendly wager of 200 gold?

[Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) likes his odds, having two squads entered under him. [Tamosha Goldron](../characters/tamosha-goldron.md) declines to participate. Mergin suggests doubling their wager which Ronvyn accepts.

## Liabella Socialises

After a while both [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) coalesce back into their groups. They both notice [Liabella Peacock](../characters/liabella-peacock.md) socialising, mostly with higher ranking military people. She is seen conversing with [Itharmund Steeleye](../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) and [Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md) for a while before heading over to [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), having recognised them.

She congratulates the new [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad on joining the military organisation, then sympathises with [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), apologising for what happened to her father ([Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md)). She is coy when asked for tournament tips, eventually excusing herself to mingle with others.

## Bryce Rallies the Troops

[Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) emerges from the crowd. [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) see him beckoning [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) over before gesturing to them too. A nine person huddle develops. He is happy to see them all, explaining that he is here to support them and make a few friendly wagers while here.

He explains that there must be a squad leader for each competing squad. As he has not yet picked which person to promote to [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) in either squad, he picks who will be acting in that role for the duration of the tournament only.

| Squad | Character |
| --- | --- |
| [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) | [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) |
| [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) | [Penance Zahiri](../characters/penance-zahiri.md) |

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) comments that it feels quick for other squads to already have a formal squad lead. Bryce wishes both Redwyn and Penance good luck, imploring them to represent him well and do their tournament duties with honour.

As both squads disperse, Redwyn pulls [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) to one side for a private chat. She cheekily suggests that Darius make it difficult for [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) to win against [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) if they meet in the arena. She explains that she will happily split her winnings with him and retire out to the countryside together if he agrees. Darius is confused, not realising her feelings for him.

*Darius Dun:*
> What are you talking about?

Before he has a chance to open his mouth and ask further, Redwyn turns and walks off, unhappy with his response. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) elbows [Morgan Caithness](../characters/morgan-caithness.md) and gossips, but Morgan doesn't care, answering without emotion. Ahsha heads off.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) goes back to [Reozin Ironhide](../characters/reozin-ironhide.md) to tell stories to [Mortar squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) of the times the pair fought in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) in their younger years, embarrassing him in the process. [Aisling Kavanagh](../characters/aisling-kavanagh.md) expresses a wish to see Ahsha's combat prowess first hand.

## [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) Meets [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)

There is a moment where both squads cross paths making their way around the room, saying hello to each other. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) does her best to seem unimpressed.

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) realise that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is the blue firbolg that they have heard news of in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) lately. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) greet her. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Saoirse converse quietly about how strange it is that everyone knows [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).

Ephaine formally introduces herself, Ahsha following suit.

*[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> Anyone that can get under the skin of the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are good people in my book.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) retort that they've done more than that, having cut down [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in combat. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) adds to the story, explaining that Torbra had to pay a fine for killing one. Saoirse explains that they killed not one but two [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). Thanea is remorseless in calling them easy to kill.

Ephaine brings up her experiences being on the run from the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), emphasising with [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md). [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tells Ephaine that they have gone up against [Astornox magicborn hunters](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md) before, prompting Ephaine to describe her run-in with a blue tiefling [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter ([Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md)) staking out the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

Starfall recant sparse details of their encounter with Kur and [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) on [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street, debating briefly who attacked first. [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) is brought up but [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) don't know of the [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md). They talk curiously of his swarm of wasps that live under his robe.

Ahsha wishes [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) good luck in their fight, but [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is quick to point out that they won't need it, earning them respect in Ahsha's eyes. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) belittles [Mortar squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) as an oversized boar with his three minions. Ahsha refuses to give any tips on fighting Reozin when prompted by [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) ask [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) about their new and sudden admittance to the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), Ephaine pointing out that it took her two years to graduate. Ephaine introduces [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) to [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md). He very politely introduces himself before remarking at how interesting [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is, referring to her looks.

## Itharmund Socialises

[Itharmund Steeleye](../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) makes his way over to [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), remembering them from the trial of the firbolg conspiracy. At the sight of a high ranking [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), Ephaine takes a big step back, excusing herself from the incoming introduction and conversation. She sees his [Astornox Commandant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-commandant.md) military badge, the full golden border giving her a sense of extremely high rank. She straightens up out of respect but remains terrified.

Itharmund arrives with [Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md), introducing himself formally as the [Astornox Commandant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-commandant.md). [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) questions why he is here, to which he explains that he and Legacy are esteemed guests of the tournament due to the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival being an infusion of the values of [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) and [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) - [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) being the patron god of the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

He speaks to [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), congratulating them on joining the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). He notes the offer the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) made for them to become [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunters. The squad express their dislike of the premise, which Itharmund sympathises with, calling it a dangerous line of work with good perks. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) retorts that their lives are short, causing [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) to stifle a laugh while Saoirse openly bursts into laughter. This causes Itharmund to close their conversation and excuse the pair of them, maintaining a polite demeanour in the face of their ridicule.

While leaving, Itharmund looks [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) over, drawn to [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md), sensing her nervousness. Ephaine does not meet his gaze, and [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) steps between the pair defensively. He senses this, passing on a short wish of good luck to [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) before excusing himself. Legacy follows him away.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) excuses herself to get another drink, much to Torbra's annoyance. Ephaine is also concerned, noting that the first rounds of the tournament will be taking place within the next few hours.

## The Hours Before Battle

A few more hours pass as both squads continue to enjoy the festivities in the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md) before making their way out to briefly experience the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festivities on the streets of the city. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) feels as if she is back at home due to the amount of her formative years she spent here.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) gets a strong sense of déjà vu, feeling like she has been here before. This feeling is triggered by her most recent deva dream taking place on the streets of [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md). [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) feels eyes on her, her reputation as the blue firbolg being ever present even here in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md).

Both squads get a sense of the amount of [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) present on the streets of [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md), many with scores to settle and strengths to prove - much machismo and bravado on show. The streets are packed with people enjoying the carnival-style games and food stalls. Both squads also get acquainted with their bunk bed rooms higher up in the stronghold during this break too.

Before long it is time for both squads to return to the stronghold before being escorted to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) for their first round of [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md).

*[[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) leave the session at this point.]*
