## Camping Until Morning

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) are riding into the southern end of [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) as the sun begins to set. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) have spotted a dire wolf howling on an eastern hilltop, followed by 40 to 50 wolves deeper into the valley replying in kind. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) sit in the back of the wagon. A third horse taken by Ephaine from archer bandits that day rides alongside the wagon, roped to Ephaine's side (right).

Still riding, the party consider their options - camp here for the night or press on. Ahsha in particular is worried about the wolves they may encounter, but defers to Ephaine's judgement. Ephaine slows the wagon down while the party discusses. Ahsha wonders if it would be possible to hide, but Ephaine reckons the wolves will find them if they want to, so this may be a matter of picking where they want to make their stand. Noon suggests someone taking the spare horse to scout ahead, but Ahsha and Ephaine aren't keen at the idea of splitting the party.

Ephaine is nervous about the wagon's two horses, not sure if she could control them if wolves attack them in transit. She would much rather stop overnight where the horses could be better protected. Ahsha asks if wolves are afraid of fire, Ephaine explaining what she knows - they're fast and rarely attack alone.

Ephaine pulls the wagon off the trail, finding a flat grassy spot nearby. She circles the cart so that it is between the party & horses and the valley to the north.

As the party gets ready to sleep overnight, Ephaine casts Darkvision in case any danger reveals itself in the night. Ahsha resolves to stay up all night. Ephaine gets a fire going while Ahsha places X torches around the campsite to help detect danger. Noon offers to stay up all night with Ahsha and encourages Ephaine to get some rest. Before resting, the party looks out into the darkness for wolves, but sees none, though Noon hears packs begin howling again, echoing from in the valley.

Noon chooses to keep Dancing Lights present around the camp all night, as well as Mage Armour which he can keep up indefinitely.

As the sun rises, Ahsha's tiredness gives way to a second wind of energy that keeps her going for now.

*[Ahsha: short rest]*  
*[Ephaine, Noon, Korina: long rest]*

## First Day in the Valley

The morning is frosty with a low lying mist as the sun begins to wash over the tops of the western hills in the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) ahead. The party packs up their camp, getting back on the wagon. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) resumes driving duties with [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) joining her up front again. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) sit in the back, Ahsha trying to catch some sleep as the party travels.

Ephaine has no issues driving the wagon as the day begins, the third riding horse cooperating, happy to have some instruction. The trail meanders through the valley, its gentle stream drifting close then far away from the trail. Noon's eyes are bloodshot, keeping his eyes preoccupied. Korina keeps an eye on the road behind, seeing nothing of note to report. It is a quiet morning out amongst the wilderness.

## Berated by Allisa

While [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) is lying in the back of the wagon trying to get some rest, she hears a feminine voice that she does not recognise in her mind:

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), Sending:*
> I hope you're happy.  
> Your meddling got someone killed and puts your angel in grave danger.  
> Astor purges those who upset the status quo.

Ahsha is confused, asking [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) what she just said. Korina's concentration breaks, unsure what Ahsha means. Ahsha chalks the voice up to tiredness, dismissing Korina, trying not to think about it.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), Sending:*
> Answer me. Answer me for what you have done.

*[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> I don't know what you're talking about.  

Ahsha is confused, asking Korina if she heard the voice a second time. Korina remains confused, unsure what Ahsha is on about. Ahsha thinks out loud that it must be some sort of magic, before replying to the message:

*[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> I don't know who you're referring to. Who have I killed? Who have I gotten killed?

It is around five minutes before a response is forthcoming.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), Sending:*
> A poor boy lies as a pile of dust at the bottom of an inn because of you.

*[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> A poor boy? What inn? What are you talking about?

Ahsha, now more confused, speaks up to [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) up front, asking if his "shadow friend" is trying to talk to her. He is equally confused, a puzzled look on his face. He tells Ahsha that he doesn't think so, asking what the voice has told her. Ahsha recants the messages, speaking of the dead boy and the inn.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) becomes aware of the conversation as Noon suggests that the only person they know that has been turned to ash was their elven spy friend, Ephaine recounting his first name ([Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md)). Ephaine wonders if the cellar they were in belonged to an inn, suggesting that it is likely Allisa that is contacting her. Ahsha tries to talk to her once again:

*[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> Who are you to invoke the name of Astor?

This time a response doesn't come.

While Noon has his head into the back of the wagon, [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears sat opposite Ahsha, turning her head towards Noon.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> It wasn't me!

The shadow smirks. Noon mentally responds that he didn't think so. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) disappears.

Ahsha becomes restless, getting out of the wagon to walk alongside it in order to wake herself up. She keeps pace, swinging her greataxe through longer strands of grass, cutting them while she is in her own head on what she just heard.

## The Rest of the Day

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) continues their journey north, following the trail as best as possible. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) spends this time thinking what sort of magic could allow someone to speak to Ahsha mentally. He recalls learning of the Message cantrip during his [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) training, having experienced it before. He is also aware of ways to overcome its distance limitation (Sending) and the vaguely codified category of magic concerning seeing and knowing events, current and future (divination magic), though has no name for it.

The morning becomes afternoon, the tall hills to the east and west passing. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) keeps an eye on the hilltops, looking for signs of wolves. Around mid afternoon the party notices a pack of four deer on the east side of the valley, some distance away. They consider whether to hunt the deer, understanding that they'd need to stop and traverse the valley floor on foot to catch them with bow and arrow. Realising that this would take time and mean spending more time amongst the wolves in this valley, they decide to press on.

As the sun begins to set to the west and the shadows rise up across the eastern hills, the sound of wolves howling echoes across the valley once again. Ephaine thinks on how far through the valley the party may be, realising that the full traversal will take several days.

Ephaine pulls the wagon over to the western slope of the valley, not too far from where the trail currently is, trying her best to find a secluded spot. As everyone dismounts and begins setting up for the night, [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) listen for the wolves, realising that the howls are echoing from both the north and south. Noon spots two regular sized wolves on a hillside on the eastern (opposite) side of the valley, howling, followed by even more. In all he spots three sets of wolves to their north and two to the south, none appearing to move or look in their direction.

Ephaine places the horses in a group, tying them to the wagon behind it, the wagon acting as a shield from the valley side of the camp. She uses Star Mote (Produce Flame) to start a campfire that the party then camps around.

| Character(s) | Shift | Observations |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)<br>[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) | 4h | Wolves howling for 1hr as the sky darkens, before stopping.<br>Cold night with clear star-filled sky.<br>3h: small pack of wolves to the south, heard growling but not seen. Throws Star Mote in their direction. It goes silent again. |
| [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md)<br>[Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) | 4h | 1h: Wolves howling in all directions, unknown numbers. |

## Wolves Attack the Camp

As the wolves continue to howl, [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) fail to hear the pack of wolves descending on the party's camp until they are almost on top of them, the sound of running through the grass with intent filling their ears.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Before Noon or Korina have a chance to react, 12 wolves descend upon the camp at speed, taking them by surprise. They rush around the wagon, predominantly targeting the horses which are the first prey most see. One wolf charges towards [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), another circles the back of the party, looking for anyone who might try to escape.

One of the draft horses and the riding horse both die in the initial attack, getting pulled to the ground and savaged by two and three wolves respectively. Ahsha wakes suddenly as a wolf clamps its mouth around her neck, puncturing it.

Noon summons [Nills](../characters/nills.md) by casting Summon Shadowspawn (emotion: fury), the shadow appearing in the middle of the pack of wolves on the left side of the wagon by the dead draft horse. Noon moves closer to the middle of the pack while [Nills](../characters/nills.md) uses Dreadful Scream, a shriek echoing across the valley, waking [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) up immediately. Three of the wolves are frightened by the sound. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) moves closer to the party, intent on making the frightened wolves flee away from the camp.

Korina looks upon the dead riding horse and the three wolves that just savaged it. She steps forward and uses her breath weapon, breathing a chilling frost over them. She then casts Healing Word on Ahsha. Ahsha stands up and lets loose her rage before swinging with her greataxe at the wolf that bit her. She hits it in the neck, collapsing it to the ground, killing it in the process.

Ephaine activates Starry Form: Dragon and casts Orbital Strike (Call Lightning), the visage of a meteor streaking towards the camp visible above. She commands part of it to break off and impact the ground with force, arriving rapidly with an accompanying streak of light. The three wolves that Korina attacked are impacted, killing two instantly which are thrown backwards, the third getting impacted heavily, causing it to turn and begin to flee. The corpse of the riding horse is knocked into the air briefly from the force of the impact, the sound of which reverberates around the valley, the echo heard several times.

The fleeing wolf gets a short distance away before collapsing from its injuries, no more life left in it. The three wolves frightened by [Nills](../characters/nills.md) turn and run as well, one of which takes a hit from the shadow's Chilling Rend, its arm briefly solidifying into a blade of shadow with which to cut. It misses, allowing all three wolves to get away from the camp and back into the darkness of the valley. The circling wolf bites Noon while the remaining two on the left side of the wagon attacks [Nills](../characters/nills.md), one landing a bite on its half-corporeal smoky form.

Noon retaliates by casting Dissonant Whispers on the wolf that just attacked him, it unfazed by the strange sounds it hears in its head. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) uses Chilling Rend on one of the two wolves, the shadowy blade passing through its body, dealing enough damage to remove the last of its will to live.

Korina bangs her mace on her shield, casting Toll the Dead on the wolf before Noon, finishing it off. She then casts Healing Word on Noon, helping him out further. Ahsha flanks the wolf before Ephaine, trying to punch it while screaming at it to run away. She hits its rear, causing it to turn and snarl at her, bearing its sharp teeth.

Ephaine commands another piece of her Orbital Strike meteor to impact nearby, targeting the wolf attacking [Nills](../characters/nills.md) without hitting her directly. The energetic impact hitting the wolf around its shoulder blades, the impact passing right through its body into the ground below with a bang, killing the wolf immediately. Ahsha punches the last remaining wolf, finishing it off.

*[Initiative order ends]*

The camp grows quiet as the last of the wolves are dispatched. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) casts Healing Word on the downed draft horse but it doesn't respond. She moves over to it, checking for signs of life, but finds it is already dead. The one remaining horse is panicked, struggling against its restraints. Ephaine tries her best to calm it, eventually succeeding by moving it away from the corpses around it.

As the adrenaline of combat subsides, [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) finds herself more tired than she remembered. She gains a point of exhaustion. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) takes a bow to [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) who returns the pleasantry before the shadow disappears on the wind.

Noon checks the wolves over. He finds wounds that correspond to the fight, but also notices on one wolf a heavy slash mark along its underside, relatively fresh, likely no older than a day. He thinks on it, feeling it was caused by a blade (actually a [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md)). Noon pets the corpse.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Good dog.

Noon goes to speak with [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), pointing out the wound. He suggests that the wolves may have been goaded into attacking the party rather than doing it of their own volition.

## Sleeping Through the Day

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) wonders how to proceed. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) suggests that if the wolves are most active at night, they should look to sleep during the day and travel during the night. Due to Ahsha's sleep deprivation and the effort of the fight, she suggests they stay put for the day to come, travelling only when sunset arrives. Ahsha asks Noon if he ever needs to sleep.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I do not. One of the few advantages of my shadowy associate.

Ahsha tries to ask if this is why Noon's first morning wearing his dress looked so refreshed and effortless, but Noon playfully chooses to keep his secrets. Ahsha at this point is clearly looking tired, so Noon encourages her into the cart. Almost as soon as she puts her head down, she passes out into restful sleep.

| Character(s) | Shift | Observations |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md)<br>[Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) | 6h | Minor wolf noises to the north before first light.<br>Morning mist. Pheasants. Elk moving north, drinking from the stream. |
| [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)<br>[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) | 6h | Overcast clouds roll in.<br>Mid-afternoon: two wolves moving south, keeping distance, one limping. |

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## Travelling by Night

As sunset arrives, the sound of wolves howling throughout the valley returns, [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) recognising the source of most of the noise coming from the north ahead of them. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) asks Noon about the unaccounted for wounds again. Noon suggests more bandits may have been responsible.

Ephaine begins guiding the single remaining draft horse as it pulls the wagon while [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) sits up front holding a torch. After a few hours during which the wolves continue howling, the horse grows tired, eventually refusing to go further, too much weight for it to pull alone. Ahsha and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) offer to walk alongside and dump half of their supply of feed to lessen its load, but a group decision is made to abandon the wagon. Ephaine detaches the horse, ropes a few bags of feed over its back, and begins leading it as the party advances on foot.

Ahsha leads the party along the darkened trail, offering torches to those who need it, Korina accepting. Noon opts instead to cast Dancing Lights, the orbs following the party, keeping at a distance that expands their range of vision. Noon also casts Mage Armour, wary of more wolves in the darkness.

Ahsha leads the party for another two hours, during which time the wolves are quiet. They then start howling again, Ephaine recognising that most of the noise is coming from the northeast. A pack of wolves can be heard, peppered with snarling and whining sounds. A dire wolf shrieks as it is killed by a [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) before the night grows silent once more.

Ahsha is spooked, suggesting the party investigates, especially as this may be relevant to [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md)'s disappearance. Ephaine relays the wolves' location, casting Pass Without Trace on the party. She suggests snuffing out the torches and proceeding slowly and cautiously. Ahsha, Korina, and Noon comply, extinguishing their sources of light.

The party is lead through the darkness slowly by Ahsha, the tension palpable, but eventually the sun begins to rise, the sight of new hills enclosing the valley becoming clear. The party is further west than they realised, hugging the bottom of the hills to the west. To the northeast larger hills can be seen, giving a hint to their location towards the north of [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md).

As the sun rises, the party camps through the day, managing to get some sleep. Those who perform watch during this time find a usual mix of wildlife but little else, the land considerably more rural with each passing day, the trail providing the only sign of civilisation out here.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

With the setting sun, the party proceeds north, Ahsha once again leading the party at a fair pace. Clouds give way to a starry night, the related cold snap growing frost on the surrounding grass.

## Advancing Wolves

While [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) focuses on leading the party and [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) keeps a close eye on the horses, [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) keeps his eyes and ears open for potential danger. In the last hours of the night the sound of wolves returns, Ephaine able to perceive listen to them and perceive a nearby pack to the northeast, the closest the party has been to wolves since being attacked in the night. Ten or so wolves all begin howling loudly at once followed by growling. Behind them the echoes of wolves far to the south respond to what they are hearing.

Ephaine suggests cutting to the chase and attacking them first, forcing the issue. Ahsha and Noon agree, sending [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) into battle preparation.

Ahsha plants her torch in the ground and draws her crossbow. Noon places himself behind Ahsha, lying in wait with ranged magic. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) joins Ahsha on the front line. Ephaine casts Bless on the other party members, staying with the horse in the middle of the pack. Noon casts Control Flames to increase the intensity of Ahsha's torch, doubling the area that it casts light over.

The distinct sound of running animals can be heard approaching from the darkness, followed by the sound of panting wolves.

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) casts Shield of Faith on [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md). [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) prepares to attack with her crossbow the first foe that enters her range. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) gets ready to cast Guiding Bolt at the first wolf she sees.

The wolves begin to enter the dim light cast by Ahsha's torch. 10 wolves and 2 dire wolves run in a pack with the dire wolves at its center. Ephaine lets loose her Guiding Bolt, impacting the first wolf, hitting its front and causing it to skid across the ground as it dies.

## They're Not After Us...

The wolves continue running into the light, but it quickly dawns on the party that they're running around the party, not interested in them. They're being chased...

Two [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) race after the pack of wolves, closing the gap quickly. As they emerge into the dim light, the party see them for the first time. While they appear wolf-like to Ahsha and Korina, Ephaine and Noon recognise that they aren't wolves, arm-like limbs in front of their four legs. The hunters both strike the two rearmost wolves, slashing them with their blade arms, killing them both instantly.

Noon casts Eldritch Blast at the closest hunter. As the force blast reaches it, the hunter turns into a cloud of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), the attack sailing through it harmlessly before the creature reassembles in an instant. Noon and Ephaine are confident that they have no idea what their foe is, worrying them both. Ahsha continues to hold her crossbow firmly, her finger itching for a chance to fire. Korina holds steady, equipping her slingshot and preparing to fire. Ephaine waits for the encounter to unfold, calming the horse in advance of incoming danger.

The wolves continue to run south, exiting the torchlight and escaping the hunters that are pursuing them.

## The Hunters Attack

Provoked by Noon's Eldritch Blast, the first [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) changes course, racing towards the party. The other follows suit. As both approach into the strong glow of the torch, everyone gets a good look at them, seeing dark grey quadrupedal features that are dog-like, but with arms protruding from their front that sharpen into long mandible-like blades. They have no eyes, a triangular pointed snout with no mouth, and spiny protrusions along their back and the back of their legs.

Both hunters teleport into melee range of the party, one to Noon, one to Korina. Both strike down with both blades the instant they appear. Ahsha lets loose her arrow, striking the hunter on Korina. She watches as the arrow impacts its stony hide before falling to the ground, seemingly doing little. She puts her crossbow away and begins pulling out her greataxe. The blades come down on their targets. Korina's shield meets both blades, but Noon takes a blade to the neck (critical hit) and one to his chest, wounding him severely. He collapses to the floor unconscious before he even has a chance to react.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md)' rage wells up as she swings her [Schiller Steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe at the [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) in front of [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md). The blade scrapes noisily across its hardened exterior for a moment before the suspended shadow within the magical metal of the blade surges to the sharpened edge. The shadow emerges, enveloping the site of the minor wound being created, softening the hunter's hide for a moment, allowing the blade to hit without hindrance. Ahsha notices the creature seems unnatural but still moves like a muscle and bone beast. Ahsha action surges, striking its shoulder, two gouges now present in its shoulder and back.

Korina casts Word of Radiance on the hunter in front of it, but it is able to resist the radiant effect. She turns to Noon, casting Healing Word to bring him to consciousness. The creatures around the party are ominously silent.

Ephaine activates Starry Form: Archer and uses her spectral archer to fire at the hunter that downed Noon. It sees her attack coming and disassembles, the spectral arrow sailing through a cloud of dust before it reforms. Ephaine follows it up with a 3rd level Guiding Bolt which smashes into the rear of the creature. The radiant beam is ricocheted off of it as dust is kicked out from the impact site, a large gouge visible, the same grey dust making up the creature's interior.

That same hunter teleports into melee range of Ephaine, crossing its blade arms and projecting a force blast at her, throwing her backwards to the floor. The other hunter gangs up on Ephaine, stabbing both of its blades down at her, puncturing her with both. One of the blades punctures her shoulder, emerging through the other side into the dirt. The sudden shock causes her to drop concentration on the Bless spell. The pair charge back to Korina and Ahsha. Ephaine stabs her dagger at the one that force blasted her, scraping its exterior and doing little damage.

Noon stands up before cursing in abyssal, casting Witch Bolt at the weakened hunter closest to him. A beam emerges from his hands, impacting the hunter in its torso, punching a hole deep into its innards, ablating dust out from the impact site. Its form begins to lose shape before a ripple runs from both ends of its being towards the middle, pulling its material along with it. The hunter grows shorter, filling in the gap in real time.

Ahsha rotates around the hunter to flank it with Noon, slashing towards it. It begins to disassemble in reaction to her attack but is too slow, her magical greataxe slashing through its torso which is now offering little resistance to her strikes. As she carves a large chunk from the top of its back, the disconnected [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) is scattered with momentum into the nearby grass. The rest of its body then follows suit, collapsing into a pile of dust beneath her swing. The first [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) is no more. Ahsha rushes over to the remaining hunter alongside Korina.

Korina uses her breath weapon to cover the hunter in ice. Its exterior flash freezes, slowing and then stopping its movements before a crack forms across its back. The dust within loosens an flows into the air above its body which then collapses and shatters, the dust then reforming a slightly smaller body in its place. This is the clearest indication of the creature's incomprehensible nature yet seen by the party. Korina casts Healing Word on Ephaine.

Ephaine uses her spectral archer on the hunter, the arrow piercing it as a radiant glow crackles and spiders out from the impact site for a moment. Ephaine follows it up with a 1st level Guiding Bolt. The [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md), wise to her tactic, chooses to disassemble for this attack instead, the beam of radiant energy passing through its dust cloud and bouncing off Ahsha's greataxe blade, reflected into the sky. Ephaine realises that the hunter is cleverer than she gave it credit for.

The hunter teleports behind Ephaine, slashing her twice with its blades, both sinking into non-vital places on her shoulder and back.

Noon steps over to gain line of sight of the hunter behind Ephaine. He casts Witch Bolt again, but it misses wide while the creature is returning from its lunged strike. Noon seeks protection alongside Korina.

Ahsha surges forwards to the hunter, standing alongside Ephaine. Korina moves over to view the hunter behind Ephaine, casting Toll the Dead. As she hits her mace off her shield, the hunter's surface ripples violently from front to back, the sound wave visibly coursing through its being.

Ephaine casts Misty Step back towards the torch, evading the hunter. She casts Guiding Bolt back at it, burning a hole through its shoulder. Part of its head on that side collapses, the dust replacing what was lost from its shoulder.

Sensing its imminent death, the [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) teleports to the south, appearing in the darkness beyond the torch. It runs away as fast as it can, intent on evading the party. With no idea where it went, the party remains on high alert for a moment before realising that the danger has most likely passed.

*[Initiative order ends]*
