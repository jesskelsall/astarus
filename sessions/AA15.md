*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I hope you're happy.  
> Your meddling got someone killed and puts your angel in grave danger.  
> Astor purges those who upset the status quo.

Ahsha asks Korina if she said anything.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> What do you have to say for yourself?

Ahsha replies, saying she doesn't know what they're talking about.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> A poor boy lays dead as a pile of ash in the bottom of an inn because of you. There will be consequences to your actions.

Ahsha asks Korina again. Noon gets involved. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) says it wasn't her.

Ahsha tries asking the voice who they are, but Allisa chooses not to answer.
