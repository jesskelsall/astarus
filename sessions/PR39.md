## Torbra Returns to the Library

In the first light of the morning [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) wakes up from [the Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) and heads back into the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), returning to [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md) as instructed by [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md).

She finds the library closed, trying the door and finding it locked. Looking around her she sees few [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) going about their business, but then hears Flavian approaching her. He excuses her and says hello, pushing past to unlock the door with a key before entering. Torbra follows him inside, watching as he retrieves a stepladder and begins lighting the gas lanterns hanging from the ceiling of the ground floor, preparing the library for the morning.

## Meeting Darius

Torbra waits patiently for 10 minutes, not sure what will transpire. From the doorway she hears [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) clear his throat, catching her attention. He slowly shuffles into the room, saying hi very hesitantly, Torbra replying in kind.

Darius says that he recognises Torbra, asking if she was in the tournament. She says yes, so he introduces himself and says that he's in [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md). When Torbra introduces herself and says she is in [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), that confirms it to Darius. The pair briefly discuss their squads' respective efforts in the tournament, Darius congratulating [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) for getting further than [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) did.

Darius steps further into the library before turning suddenly, realising he should probably close the door. He fumbles as he goes, the base of his staff impacting the ground as he almost drops it, the sound catching the attention of Flavian momentarily who then goes back to ignoring the pair while filing books on the other side of the ground floor.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> So... I realise now that you're an earth genasi.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> I had a feeling, so I guess that's confirmation?

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> Only because I've met another.

Torbra asks if the person is a small girl, which confuses Darius who denies it. He gets confused before resetting the conversion, stating he is a fire genasi, pointing at his red skin as a giveaway. He tells Torbra that he is trying to find others of his kind, and that while [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md) won't provide any answers on the topic, there are many other genasi "like us" out there, but trips up when attempting to explain that there are other types of genasi, failing to find the words for it, calling it "complicated" instead.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> We share something in common. It's... it's complicated. I'm not really sure actually, but I'm looking for others.

Darius goes on to explain that while in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) for [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md), he met up with a halfling ([Sengras Longfoot](../characters/sengras-longfoot.md)) who he had been writing to. He tells Torbra that he is "much like you", with similar skin.

Torbra questions what Darius is saying about there being others like the pair of them "but different". Darius tells Torbra what he knows - that there is some sort of elemental binding that they share in common, but it manifests in a number of different ways, with fire and earth being two of them.

[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) demonstrates his fire genasi ability, placing a palm face up and manifesting a small fire tornado in his hand, one foot tall. [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md) immediately shouts at him, telling him not to do that in here, causing Darius to clench his fist, dissipating the fire. He is incredibly flustered and apologises profusely. Torbra ends the awkwardness by saying that it was cool to see, to which Darius utters a nervous thank you.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> Thanks. My parents didn't seem to think so, but that's another story.

Darius explains that his powers manifest as always being too warm, then recants what Sengras told him about his own experiences: he heard voices as a teen. He asks if Torbra finds that familiar. Torbra agrees, mentioning finding strange rocks that glowed only to her and were surrounded by voices only she could hear. Since then her powers manifested, most notably her ability to grow in size temporarily, though she isn't sure if that is strictly an earth genasi trait or something else.

Torbra asks Darius if he saw her use that ability in the tournament, but Darius didn't, explaining that he wasn't around to watch [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s matches. He tells Torbra that [Penance Zahiri](../characters/penance-zahiri.md) spoke highly of her, calling her a "true fighter". Darius thought that Torbra's ability was another form of magic that he is aware of (Enlarge/Reduce).

Darius muses on their situation, noting that even with such an extensive library at their disposal, there's little information about them, suggesting that they are a rare breed. Torbra agrees but notes that she is now aware of three earth genasi.

## Hushed Conversations

[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) asks [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) for more details on [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md). Torbra begins describing her in past tense, prompting a shocked Darius to ask if she's still alive. Fortunately Torbra can assuage his fears. She goes on to explain the circumstances in which [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) came across her, and what [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) told her about the reputation of genasi within the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).

As soon as she mentions the republic, Darius begins to look visibly nervous, his eyes darting around the room, particularly towards [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md). Torbra stops, realising she shouldn't talk so openly. Darius suddenly tells Torbra that there's a book upstairs that may contain some answers, ushering Torbra upstairs. He leads Torbra to the far corner of the floor, down between two bookshelves, well out of sight and sound.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md), whispering:*
> There's a reason there's not more information in here.

Torbra says she is curious but Darius isn't sure what the reason behind it is. Torbra begins to say that they should take what they can get and keep in contact, but while doing so, Darius grabs her by the chest and pulls her in closer, whispering directly into her ear.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> The [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) know more.

Darius asks Torbra what she's learned. She tells Darius that the word used for them is "genasi", it is seen as a favoured quality within the republic, it is often seen as a divine blessing, and that there are other types of genasi. She notes that between the pair of them they are earth and fire genasi, and through the story of [Simanelli Tyrol](../characters/simanelli-tyrol.md) she is confident that water genasi exist, but perhaps there are others. Torbra senses from how Darius reacts as she talks that he has conducted the same research that she has, recognising captain Tyrol's story.

Darius finds solace in now having a name for their kind, calling it progress enough for one day. He asks about [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md), wishing to visit her. Torbra tells him that she sent her father [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) to Iredale. Darius isn't certain that he'll have a chance to visit as [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md)'s next mission only takes them as far as Eaglesfield, but will visit if given half a chance.

Darius then offers to give Torbra the address of the earth genasi in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) if she'd like to write to him. Torbra agrees, so Darius states his name ([Sengras Longfoot](../characters/sengras-longfoot.md)) and provides his details. He goes on to tell her that he is an [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md), but seemed pleasant enough. When Torbra says she will try to visit him or write to him if she is unable, Darius states the letters he sent to him prior to their meeting were quickly replied to.

Torbra suggests that her and Darius keep in contact and share what they know. Darius looks at Torbra thoughtfully for a moment before Torbra hears his voice in her head without his lips moving:

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md), Sending:*
> I'll check in with you periodically.

Torbra nods approvingly. Darius can be seen shivering as he puts his public face back on, emerging from between the bookshelves, heading for the stairs. As he goes he pretends to be continuing an innocuous conversation that they may have been having about a book on that shelf:

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> It's curious, the early history of the kingdom. To think that people arrived here and had to find all of these places, and were adventurous enough to see what lay beyond the [Sea of Songs](../places/seas-oceans/sea-of-songs.md).

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> I think everything was new once upon a time.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> Indeed. Before [The Arrival](../history/events/the-third-coming.md) there was no one here. Our ancestors were fortunate.

Torbra feeds into the lie, thanking Darius for showing her such an insightful book. He states his need to go and prepare for his departure for [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md)'s mission to [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md), before asking if Torbra is on a mission currently. Torbra states that [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) are about to depart heading west. Darius points out that they are headed in opposite directions, so wishes her well, bowing his head out of respect. He turns around quickly before exiting through the door, hurriedly walking to escape a social situation that was beginning to stress him out.

## Retrieving the Map

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) returns to [the Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md), sitting downstairs until [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) wake up and come down from their rooms. The pair notice that Torbra was up before them and seemed quite awake, but thought nothing more of it.

The three head off towards [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) to retrieve Thanea's replacement map ([Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md)). Along the way they meet up with [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) who was waiting expectantly inside of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) gatehouse.

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) make their way into [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md), Thanea wordlessly leading the party on. Torbra tries to ask [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) how she's finding the squad, but she is dismissive, wishing to get on with it so they can all get paid.

Arriving on the third floor, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) pushes through the door without hesitation. She finds [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) sat at the center table, eating a plate of breakfast, food in mouth. She says morning to the party, gesturing across the table to the rolled up map before tucking back into her meal.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) reads the room, pointing Thanea to the map quickly, telling her not to lose it this time. Thanea grabs it before apologising quietly to Elysia as she backs away from the table. Elysia doesn't stop eating, putting more food in her mouth gracefully, but gives an OK hand signal in acknowledgement.

The party shuffles out of the room. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is the last to leave, saying to Elysia "don't work too hard now" as she goes to close the door. Elysia doesn't move except for raising a middle finger to [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) in playful acknowledgement.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Love you too, bye.

Thanea tells [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) that what she did was unnecessary. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) fires back that unnecessary is her style, so she should get used to it, which silences Thanea.

## Confronted by the Stables

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) seeks transportation towards [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) offers to show the party to the stables, so she leads the party out of the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md) to the north east stable which is just outside of the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md).
