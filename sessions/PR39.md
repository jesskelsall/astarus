## Torbra Returns to the Library

In the first light of the morning [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) wakes up from [the Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) and heads back into the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), returning to [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md) as instructed by [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md).

She finds the library closed, trying the door and finding it locked. Looking around her she sees few [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) going about their business, but then hears Flavian approaching her. He excuses her and says hello, pushing past to unlock the door with a key before entering. Torbra follows him inside, watching as he retrieves a stepladder and begins lighting the gas lanterns hanging from the ceiling of the ground floor, preparing the library for the morning.

## Meeting Darius

Torbra waits patiently for 10 minutes, not sure what will transpire. From the doorway she hears [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) clear his throat, catching her attention. He slowly shuffles into the room, saying hi very hesitantly, Torbra replying in kind.

Darius says that he recognises Torbra, asking if she was in the tournament. She says yes, so he introduces himself and says that he's in [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md). When Torbra introduces herself and says she is in [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), that confirms it to Darius. The pair briefly discuss their squads' respective efforts in the tournament, Darius congratulating [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) for getting further than [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) did.

Darius steps further into the library before turning suddenly, realising he should probably close the door. He fumbles as he goes, the base of his staff impacting the ground as he almost drops it, the sound catching the attention of Flavian momentarily who then goes back to ignoring the pair while filing books on the other side of the ground floor.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> So... I realise now that you're an earth elemental.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> I had a feeling, so I guess that's confirmation?

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> Only because I've met another.

Torbra asks if the person is a small girl, which confuses Darius who denies it. He gets confused before resetting the conversion, stating he is a fire elemental, pointing at his red skin as a giveaway. He tells Torbra that he is trying to find others of his kind, and that while [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md) won't provide any answers on the topic, there are many other elementals "like us" out there, but trips up when attempting to explain that there are other types of elementals, failing to find the words for it, calling it "complicated" instead.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> We share something in common. It's... it's complicated. I'm not really sure actually, but I'm looking for others.

Darius goes on to explain that while in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) for [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md), he met up with a halfling ([Sengras Longfoot](../characters/sengras-longfoot.md)) who he had been writing to. He tells Torbra that he is "much like you", with similar skin.

Torbra questions what Darius is saying about there being others like the pair of them "but different". Darius tells Torbra what he knows - that there is some sort of elemental binding that they share in common, but it manifests in a number of different ways, with fire and earth being two of them.

[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) demonstrates his fire genasi ability, placing a palm face up and manifesting a small fire tornado in his hand, one foot tall. [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md) immediately shouts at him, telling him not to do that in here, causing Darius to clench his fist, dissipating the fire. He is incredibly flustered and apologises profusely. Torbra ends the awkwardness by saying that it was cool to see, to which Darius utters a nervous thank you.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> Thanks. My parents didn't seem to think so, but that's another story.

Darius explains that his powers manifest as always being too warm, then recants what Sengras told him about his own experiences: he heard voices as a teen. He asks if Torbra finds that familiar. Torbra agrees, mentioning finding strange rocks that glowed only to her and were surrounded by voices only she could hear. Since then her powers manifested, most notably her ability to grow in size temporarily, though she isn't sure if that is strictly an earth genasi trait or something else.

Torbra asks Darius if he saw her use that ability in the tournament, but Darius didn't, explaining that he wasn't around to watch [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s matches. He tells Torbra that [Penance Zahiri](../characters/penance-zahiri.md) spoke highly of her, calling her a "true fighter". Darius thought that Torbra's ability was another form of magic that he is aware of (Enlarge/Reduce).

Darius muses on their situation, noting that even with such an extensive library at their disposal, there's little information about them, suggesting that they are a rare breed. Torbra agrees but notes that she is now aware of three earth genasi.

## Hushed Conversations

[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) asks [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) for more details on [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md). Torbra begins describing her in past tense, prompting a shocked Darius to ask if she's still alive. Fortunately Torbra can assuage his fears. She goes on to explain the circumstances in which [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) came across her, and what [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) told her about the reputation of genasi within the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).

As soon as she mentions the republic, Darius begins to look visibly nervous, his eyes darting around the room, particularly towards [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md). Torbra stops, realising she shouldn't talk so openly. Darius suddenly tells Torbra that there's a book upstairs that may contain some answers, ushering Torbra upstairs. He leads Torbra to the far corner of the floor, down between two bookshelves, well out of sight and sound.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md), whispering:*
> There's a reason there's not more information in here.

Torbra says she is curious but Darius isn't sure what the reason behind it is. Torbra begins to say that they should take what they can get and keep in contact, but while doing so, Darius grabs her by the chest and pulls her in closer, whispering directly into her ear.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> The [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) know more.

Darius asks Torbra what she's learned. She tells Darius that the word used for them is "genasi", it is seen as a favoured quality within the republic, it is often seen as a divine blessing, and that there are other types of genasi. She notes that between the pair of them they are earth and fire genasi, and through the story of [Simanelli Tyrol](../characters/simanelli-tyrol.md) she is confident that water genasi exist, but perhaps there are others. Torbra senses from how Darius reacts as she talks that he has conducted the same research that she has, recognising captain Tyrol's story.

Darius finds solace in now having a name for their kind, calling it progress enough for one day. He asks about [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md), wishing to visit her. Torbra tells him that she sent her father [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) to Iredale. Darius isn't certain that he'll have a chance to visit as [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md)'s next mission only takes them as far as Eaglesfield, but will visit if given half a chance.

Darius then offers to give Torbra the address of the earth genasi in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) if she'd like to write to him. Torbra agrees, so Darius states his name ([Sengras Longfoot](../characters/sengras-longfoot.md)) and provides his details. He goes on to tell her that he is an [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md), but seemed pleasant enough. When Torbra says she will try to visit him or write to him if she is unable, Darius states the letters he sent to him prior to their meeting were quickly replied to.

Torbra suggests that her and Darius keep in contact and share what they know. Darius looks at Torbra thoughtfully for a moment before Torbra hears his voice in her head without his lips moving:

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md), Sending:*
> I'll check in with you periodically.

Torbra nods approvingly. Darius can be seen shivering as he puts his public face back on, emerging from between the bookshelves, heading for the stairs. As he goes he pretends to be continuing an innocuous conversation that they may have been having about a book on that shelf:

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> It's curious, the early history of the kingdom. To think that people arrived here and had to find all of these places, and were adventurous enough to see what lay beyond the [Sea of Songs](../places/seas-oceans/sea-of-songs.md).

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> I think everything was new once upon a time.

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md):*
> Indeed. Before [The Arrival](../history/events/the-third-coming.md) there was no one here. Our ancestors were fortunate.

Torbra feeds into the lie, thanking Darius for showing her such an insightful book. He states his need to go and prepare for his departure for [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md)'s mission to [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md), before asking if Torbra is on a mission currently. Torbra states that [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) are about to depart heading west. Darius points out that they are headed in opposite directions, so wishes her well, bowing his head out of respect. He turns around quickly before exiting through the door, hurriedly walking to escape a social situation that was beginning to stress him out.

## Retrieving the Map

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) returns to [the Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md), sitting downstairs until [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) wake up and come down from their rooms. The pair notice that Torbra was up before them and seemed quite awake, but thought nothing more of it.

The three head off towards [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) to retrieve Thanea's replacement map ([Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md)). Along the way they meet up with [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) who was waiting expectantly inside of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) gatehouse.

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) make their way into [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md), Thanea wordlessly leading the party on. Torbra tries to ask [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) how she's finding the squad, but she is dismissive, wishing to get on with it so they can all get paid.

Arriving on the third floor, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) pushes through the door without hesitation. She finds [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) sat at the center table, eating a plate of breakfast, food in mouth. She says morning to the party, gesturing across the table to the rolled up map before tucking back into her meal.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) reads the room, pointing Thanea to the map quickly, telling her not to lose it this time. Thanea grabs it before apologising quietly to Elysia as she backs away from the table. Elysia doesn't stop eating, putting more food in her mouth gracefully, but gives an OK hand signal in acknowledgement.

The party shuffles out of the room. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is the last to leave, saying to Elysia "don't work too hard now" as she goes to close the door. Elysia doesn't move except for raising a middle finger to [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) in playful acknowledgement.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Love you too, bye.

Thanea tells [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) that what she did was unnecessary. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) fires back that unnecessary is her style, so she should get used to it, which silences Thanea.

## Confronted by the Stables

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) seeks transportation towards [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) offers to show the party to the stables, so she leads the party out of the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md) to the [Northhaven Stables North](../places/buildings/stables/northhaven-stables-north.md) which is just outside of the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md).

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) notices [Candle in the Dark](../characters/candle-in-the-dark.md) stood against a wall across the street. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) additionally notices [Kasdon Tinkermane](../characters/kasdon-tinkermane.md) conversing with her, but then notices the party passing through, so he stops talking, eyes the party up, and starts heading in their direction. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) signals to the party while she observes him pointing irately back at Candle as he approaches.

Kasdon walks up to the party, catching their attention. Saoirse and [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) notice an [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md) badge. Kasdon looks towards [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md).

*[Kasdon Tinkermane](../characters/kasdon-tinkermane.md):*
> Alright, ya tournament chucklefucks.

Thanea replies with stern words, asking if they wanted anything. Kasdon continues to express his disdain for the group while Thanea argues with him. Candle makes her way over after Kasdon, her arms folded. She asks the party to excuse her colleague before pressing a firm hand down on Kasdon's shoulder and berating him, warning him not to start something and that she is sick of him.

Candle stiffens up before apologising politely to the party, giving intense looks to Kasdon the entire time. Thanea asks what his deal is, prompting Candle to pre-emptively try to pull Kasdon away by the shoulder, but he bats her arm away and descends into a furious rant:

*[Kasdon Tinkermane](../characters/kasdon-tinkermane.md):*
> People like you make me sick! You get to kill [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), and now you're part of the fucking military rather than in the bloody ground.

Kasdon stops himself, holding his anger back and eyeing Candle for silent help. Candle greets his gaze with an intense look of disapproval.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) looks at the rest of the party, expressing her surprise that they killed [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), seeing it as a sign that [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) might not be so boring. Saoirse confidently states that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) should have picked their fights better, so it's not their fault. Thanea whispers to the party that their comments aren't making this any easier. Saoirse argues that it was self defence. Thanea reckons the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) don't care, but Saoirse eyes Kasdon, stating that one of them does.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Anyway, if you need anything else, I think your babysitter is calling, so how about you get out of here? We've got stuff to do.

Kasdon stares at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) with gritted teeth as his head slowly turns to match his gaze.

*[Kasdon Tinkermane](../characters/kasdon-tinkermane.md):*
> Yes, we should probably leave before someone gets hurt. Don't hurry back now.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) playfully suggests that they're in no rush and will take their time, eliciting a "good" from Kasdon. He beckons Candle along with him, turning to leave back across the street.

As he crosses the road, a citizen holding planks of wood over his shoulder joins the back of the queue to get through the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md). Kasdon moves to pass him, but instead chooses to take out his anger, hitting the back of his leg with an open palm technique. This causes the citizen to fall limp in an instant, the wood tumbling from his shoulder as he falls forward into the muddy street. [Kasdon Tinkermane](../characters/kasdon-tinkermane.md) stops off defiantly, shortly followed by [Candle in the Dark](../characters/candle-in-the-dark.md).

An [Astornox guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) from the gatehouse rushes over to check on the citizen, crouching down before him. He shouts "hey" several times towards the pair of [Astornox Magicborn Hunters](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md), but they continue to walk off. The guard beckons for help from the gatehouse, another guard arriving to assist. The pair pick up the citizen while two nearby people collect up his wood for him. As the guards drag the unconscious citizen away, one turns to the party and shakes his head in mutual disbelief:

*[Astornox Guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md):*
> [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) Hunters, am I right?

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) begins to state that the party have had their fair share of run-ins with hunters already. The guard's face sours.

*[Astornox Guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md):*
> Yeah, everyone knows who you are.

Thanea is annoyed, stating that the guards should make up their mind.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> We did well in the tournament, boo hoo. What's wrong with these people?

Thanea tells Saoirse that she thinks it is because they killed an [Astornox Magicborn Hunter](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md) ([Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md)). Saoirse is dismissive. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) jokingly asks if there are any more killings that she should be aware of.

## Securing Transport

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) enters the [Northhaven Stables North](../places/buildings/stables/northhaven-stables-north.md) office. They wait for a moment while the two citizens in front are talked through their transportation options, it clear to observers that they aren't well travelled and aren't knowledgeable about modes of transport.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) approaches the counter, doing the talking for the party. She recognises the stable hand, [Clifford Donnesh](../characters/clifford-donnesh.md), making small talk about his injured leg which is still bothering him, injured in an incident that killed his horse.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks about transport options to the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md), prompting Clifford to ask why they'd be headed there at this time of year (mid autumn). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) begins to talk about a magic ball that they're looking for, causing [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) to kick her in silent protest, aware that their mission is secretive. Thanea gives her a similar glance and elbow in the side. Clifford states that he heard nothing, his only business being horses and carts.

Clifford lays out the available transport options. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks if there are any goods shipments that they could move for him. He informs her that he has a shipment that needs taking to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), which he could provide a good price for if they were willing to take it. When [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks if there is anything going further afield, Clifford tells her that without hiring someone just for themselves, [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) or [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) is the furthest they'll get.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) what she wants to do, noting that the goods shipment option will be the cheapest, and that they could secure onwards transport once in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks if they are likely to make or lose money delivering the shipment. Clifford reckons they'll break even. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) bemoaning the current state of the world.

Thanea playfully agrees to the proposition as long as they're not transporting anything illegal. Both [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and clifford chuckle. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) says that they'd definitely be making money if that were the case. Clifford questions the judgement of operating illegally so close to the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md), which he points to the shadow of out of his window. Clifford states that the cargo is pears, offering them a bag of the cargo if they'd like, as nobody will notice a little bit going missing.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) pays 10 gp for the goods, on the understanding that the shipment is delivered to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) quickly, and that payment on arrival is time sensitive.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) expresses a desire to take their time within reason, not wishing to push too hard and end up breaking the cart or horses, noting that the roads won't be their best at this time of year. Clifford agrees, explaining that the roads were fine until the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) made their way back down from the mountains for the season.

Within half an hour the party is presented with their horses and cart, 2/3 full of sacks of pears, with room in the back for two to sit facing each other, while two sit up front - one driving, one observing and navigating. The cart is cheap and cheerful, not looking comfortable. Both the cart and its cargo is painted/branded with cargo markings that don't make any sense to the party, but allow traders to discern who the cargo is intended for.

## Leaving [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md)

Today's weather is cloudy and overcast, the first signs of yellow and orange leaves on the trees present. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) leads the horses north out of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), the road rising up to the crest of a hill that the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) runs across. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) look out of the back of the cart as the familiar skyline of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) stretches out before them. Up front Torbra and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) can see [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md) set inside a bend in the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md). The original members of [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) recall their first perilous journey into [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), and how times have changed.

Torbra turns left, beginning their journey west along the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md). Before long they cross the large arched stone slab bridge across a wide section of the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), with views across [Duskmere](../places/rivers-lakes/duskmere.md) of both [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) and [Fort Eldrick](../places/forts/fort-eldrick.md). As they proceed they pass various people on horseback, carts, and groups of patrolling [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) passes out pears.

By evening the party reaches a junction where the [Humar Cut](../places/roads/humar-cut.md) crosses the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md). Torbra doesn't slow down to observe the signs, unable to read where the trail leads. Before much longer it begins getting dark, a full day of travel made. Thanea gives an accurate estimate of their progress on her map. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks if they'd be able to reach a settlement today, but Thanea makes it clear that [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) requires a few days to reach.

Deciding that it would be best to rest rather than press on, Torbra pulls the horses and cart off the road, finding a patch of grass a short distance from the road itself, far enough off to not appear accidentally stuck.

## Camping for the Rich

As the party begin setting up their camp for the night between the cart and the road, [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) pulls out a crystal bead, holding it up, asking the part if they know what it does. Both [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) respond that they don't.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> This little thing is what I like to call "camping for the rich".

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) flicks the bead between her fingers in the hand that holds it, casting Tiny Hut. A magical dome forms around the party before becoming transparent in appearance from the inside. The air within quickly becomes pleasant like a warm tavern, not cold like the autumn evening air.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> This is what I like to call "mi casa".

Saoirse finds the dome intriguing. She steps forward, searching for its edge with her hand set forward. As her hand begins to pass through it, she feels a weird sensation not unlike very faint static electricity with a slightly cold tingle. Pushing through that her head emerges. She looks down, seeing the outside of the brown dome instead of her body.

Saoirse tells [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) that the dome is impressive, but wonders if she could have made it look less conspicuous, but [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) wonders how a big magical dome on the roadside could blend in at all. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) indicates that she could try something different next time, but for tonight the spell has already been cast.

| Character(s) | Shift | Observations |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)<br>[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | 4h | Someone riding in the direction of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) at speed.<br>A pair of would-be highway thieves on horseback stop to examine the cart. They notice the dome, converse about how it is likely magic and they have a bad feeling about it, then depart quickly. |
| [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)<br>[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | 4h | Black bears in the vicinity. The horses make distressed noises that scare the bears off. |

*[Everyone: long rest]*

In the morning, as everyone is slowly waking, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s Tiny Hut ends, disappearing in an instant. Moments later the bitter cold morning air reaches the party. The morning is frosty, though a circle of dry frost-free grass remains where the hut had been.

Saoirse asks for breakfast before the party departs, wondering if anyone brought breakfast food with them. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) offers pears from the cart while Thanea offers rations that were bought for the journey. Thanea hands out rations for everyone to consume as the morning meal.

## Word from Darius

As [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is packing up the camp, she hears a recent familiar voice in her head:

*[Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md), Sending:*
> I sent a letter to our friend telling him about you. I hope that's okay.

Torbra stops what she is doing and looks around, expecting to see someone whispering in her ear. She finds nobody, noting that everyone else is accounted for nearby, packing up their belongings.

Torbra doesn't know how to process what she has heard, so she gets back on with preparing the horses, not thinking any more of it for now.

## Continuing West

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) continues along the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) to the west. By mid-morning they cross the cobbled stone bridge that spans the [River Carn](../places/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md). The bridge is notably less grand than the one over the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), with a rough gravel road surface over it that matches the road itself.

## Allisa Makes Contact

While [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) continues west, [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) casts Scrying on [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), successfully seeing her in the cart, confirming her suspicions that the dark figure in her deva dream ([Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)) was the same person she saw collapsed on an [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) street during the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) Festival.

After a moment, Allisa decides to reach out to Saoirse, an unfamiliar feminine voice with an unfamiliar accent ([elvish](../languages/elvish.md)) appearing in her head.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), Sending:*
> I told you I wouldn't forget about you, child.

Saoirse instinctively responds vocally, not thinking about who might hear her:

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> What the fuck did you just say? Who are you?

For a brief moment, Saoirse vaguely recognises the sound of the voice and its manner of speaking, her mind connecting dots she didn't realise existed. There is a flash of her [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) fuelled high in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) following [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) being knocked out of [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md).

After ten seconds or so, she receives a response:

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), Sending:*
> Where is your cart going? I can meet you there, and then I will answer all of your questions.

Saoirse is confused, but opts to talk to the party:

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Where are we going again? Some dude is asking. They say they're going to tell me stuff. Sounds pretty interesting.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) questions what Saoirse is on about but she is dismissive, calling the group weird and advising she doesn't think about it.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) answers Saoirse's question, telling her that they're going to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md).

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Well, if you're still listening, we're going to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md).

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) again questions who Saoirse is talking to, her confusion growing.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), Sending:*
> Okay, I'll see if I can meet you there. Tell me--

Saoirse interrupts, demanding to know who the voice in her head belongs to, still speaking out loud.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), Sending:*
> I'm a friend, but not a friend of your people. Tell me, do you know of the angel?

Saoirse scurries up over the sacks of pears to the back of Thanea, laughter in her voice as she asks her if they know of an angel, "*the* angel". Thanea turns to Saoirse, visibly confused. Saoirse explains that the person is asking her questions such as where they're going and if she knows the angel.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is incredulous, pointing out that a shifty person's voice in her head is claiming to be her friend and asking very specific questions of her whereabouts which is incredibly suspicious. Saoirse points out that the voice claims to be *her* friend specifically, but not a friend of "our people", but they are being "vague as fuck". [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is unhappy but dismissive, wondering how she managed to get into this trouble.

Thanea whispers to Saoirse, asking if it is [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md), but Saoirse says no. Thanea advises that Saoirse is careful with what she says. Saoirse states that they want to meet up. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is forward, saying that as long as this person doesn't get them killed.

Saoirse tries her best to respond, not sure exactly how doing so works. She continues to speak out loud.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> So, I don't know how this works or if you just hear everything I'm saying or just what I'm saying directly to you, but... I know of some angels? I've dreamt of some angels, but I don't know about *the* angel. I'm sorry!

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), Sending:*
> The one from the tournament. I was... I am looking for her.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Oh! I know her. What do you want with her?

After a few minutes of painful waiting, a response comes:

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), Sending:*
> I don't want to be alone any more.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Wait, so you're like her?

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), Sending:*
> I think... you were both in my dream with me. Was it your hand I held?

Saoirse moves back over to Thanea to discuss. She tells Thanea that she thinks this person is the third person from their dream. Thanea asks if they're using magic to contact her. Saoirse confirms, but wonders why they are contacting her and not Thanea. She says that they saw them both at the tournament and must know of them because of that. Thanea reiterates that regardless, they should proceed with caution.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) attempts to reply to [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) again, but no response comes.

Thanea asks Saoirse if she knows where the person is. Saoirse says that they said they'd meet them in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). Thanea questions if that means they're looking for someone wearing the armour they saw in their dream. Saoirse assumes so, but Thanea once again warns that her deva dreams aren't literal in all details, so all bets are off. Saoirse doesn't agree, pointing out that in their dream they saw accurate representations of each other.

The conversation between the pair goes on in earshot of [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) tuts, remarking to herself that they are a pair of lunatics.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Okay, so, just so you know: she's an angel, I'm a freak or something else, we have dreams, and two nights ago we had a shared dream with another person, and I think that was the person who  tried to contact me just now. It's like... weird magic shit, it happens.

Saoirse, Thanea, and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) rib on [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), making fun of her original comment that they're a "bunch of normies". Saoirse points out that Torbra can grow tall too, so between them there is plenty of unusual talent. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) rolls her eyes and is dismissive, insisting that the party goes back to delivering pears.
