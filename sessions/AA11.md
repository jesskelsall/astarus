## Sounding the Alarm

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) step back out into the courtyard outside of the building they hid [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md)'s corpse in. They notice that the streets are busier than when they entered the sewers, the final day of the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival attracting its largest crowd yet.

Wishing to sound the alarm on what they've found and heard from [Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md), they head to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), looking for [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md). At the side entrance they are stopped by a mix of [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) guarding the door. The [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) asks if they are on the guest list, [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) persuading them to get help, particularly as the group looks very rough. When the member asks what's going on, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) insists that it's need-to-know [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) business, and they get the message.

With an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) heading inside to get help, the [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) with the guest list expresses their failed desire to be an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md), revealing an arm covered in scars from bite wounds. They place a hand on [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md)'s shoulder and use their druidic magic to cast Cure Wounds.

The [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) that went to get help returns, informing the party that [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) isn't inside, despite being on the guest list - though it is roughly 5 hours until the [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md) final match. Ephaine asks if [Samantha Ilis](../characters/samantha-ilis.md) is inside, but that name is not found on the guest list. She then asks for [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) who isn't here before the [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) tells them that [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) is here.

The party accompany the [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) into [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), leading them along a grand corridor then through a room where many [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) officers are relaxing and socialising. Beyond is another grand room, with [Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md) and [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) at its center, quietly conversing.

As the [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) barges through the double doors into this room, Legacy demands to know why they are being interrupted. Noon speaks up, insisting that their business is important. Legacy demands they get on with it if that is the case. Noon explains that the party have discovered a [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) plot that could be targeting the tournament. Legacy beckons over an [Astornox guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) who he instructs to fetch [Tanin Arnous](../characters/tanin-arnous.md) at once.

Ephaine provides Legacy with the [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md) military badge that she found on [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md)'s corpse, as well as one of his ears. He is emotionless as he examines both items, but then immediately shouts to the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in earshot:

*[Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md):*
> Lock the building, now!

The room erupts into chaos as the enlisted [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in the room scramble to figure out what is going on and lock down the building. Into the room enters [Tanin Arnous](../characters/tanin-arnous.md) who comes straight over to Legacy, asking what is going on. Tanin and Legacy exchange glances as Legacy reveals the half-elf ear wrapped in a napkin. Tanin demands the party succinctly explain what is going on.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) tells Tanin that they believe [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spies are using the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers to disrupt the tournament. Ephaine and Noon explain that they found a half-elven corpse in a section of the sewers that they believe runs directly under [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md). Tanin is dismissive of the news of an already dead elf.

Ephaine tries to explain that they learned from someone ([Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md)) about [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spies that have already infiltrated [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md). When Tanin asks for his name, Ephaine gives it willingly, understanding that this might upset Ahsha. Neither Tanin or Legacy recognise the name. When Ephaine suggests that Barthon has likely fled the city already, Legacy orders Tanin to fetch a truthseeker. When Legacy asks Ephaine where Barthon was last seen, she is unable to explain where the building they were in was. Ahsha chooses not to divulge details. Legacy becomes frustrated with the lack of usable information being provided.

Ephaine tries to salvage the situation by divulging some details of what Barthon told them. She informs Legacy of [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), the presumed ring leader of the spies, who has been threatening Barthon and appearing at his house.

She once again suggests that an attack on the tournament could be afoot. Legacy is confident that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) have the arena protected. Ephaine asks where there might be an attack vector, but Legacy refuses to discuss security weaknesses. Ahsha and Ephaine implore Legacy to at least do something. He concedes, asking Tanin if there are any more [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) to spare.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) suggests that [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) could help. Legacy sneers down his nose at Ahsha, but she meets his gaze, not taking his intimidation.

*[Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md):*
> Okay. You think you're all that? Well, I suggest you get back out there and come back with some more useful information. Or even better yet, some people in chains. Because if you don't, and if I have my way, you won't have a badge by the end of today.

[Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md), who has been standing back and listening in this entire time, steps forward and touches his hand to Legacy's side, sternly stating:

*[Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md):*
> You won't have your way, that's not your jurisdiction.

[Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md) gives Ronvyn some serious side-eye before excusing himself to go and bark orders at the [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) still present in the corner of the room. Ronvyn reintroduces himself, explaining that they've met before at the tournament's opening meeting.

## Formulating a Plan

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) once again offers [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)'s help in any way possible. [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) points out the mess that the next few hours will be thanks to the party, and concedes that Legacy was right about one thing - the situation will go smoother for them if they are able to find more evidence of spies or a plot.

Ronvyn asks the squad where in the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) structure they sit. Ephaine explains they are assigned to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), under the command of [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md). Ronvyn thanks them for bringing the situation to his attention, imploring them to get back onto the streets and investigate what might be going on. He orders the squad to report to him directly for the time being. When Ahsha asks for aid before they head out, Ronvyn casts Mass Healing Word (*"bark"*) on the party.

Ronvyn gives an overview of [Astornox guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) placement within the city. He notes that the guards are mostly stationed around [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), leaving the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md) nearby and the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) Stronghold on the city outskirts less protected than usual. He expresses a desire to send some [Astorrel guards](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) back to the stronghold just in case.

When Noon once again presses the importance of the sewers, Ronvyn rolls out a map of the city on a nearby table. He waves is hand over it, casting Illusory Script to reveal glowing blue lines representing the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers. They animate slightly, showing the direction the sewage travels through the system. Ahsha is able to point to the courtyard outside of the building they descended into the sewers from, allowing Ronvyn to trace the sewers from there towards the arena. He shows the party that the section of the sewers they were in isn't closely connected to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) or either of the strongholds. Ronvyn is generous with the privileged information of the sewer system, even showing the party how one could get into the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md).

He goes on to highlight a few sewer access points that lead to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md).

| Outside | Arena Access | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dead end | Leads into storage rooms under arena stands, next to arena floor. | Has the most guards of all the entrances. |
| Crossroads | | |
| Right angle | | |

Ephaine is keen to learn about which direction the sewage flows through these sections. Ronvyn explains that the sewage flows away from the arena which considered sanitation when it was built. When Ephaine asks about the sewage flow near where they found [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md)'s corpse, he reveals that upstream from there leads out of the city. When the party gets caught up in thinking about if the spies have a way of getting into the city via the sewers, Ronvyn tells them to focus on the threat against the tournament, as the [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) will be redistributed by tomorrow and can help with issues away from the arena.

When [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) takes a side bar to discuss what they should do, they realise that it's not their decision to make and defer to Ronvyn. He makes it official that their orders are to search around the sewers connected to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), and to report back before the tournament starts. He assures the party that he will make the effort worth their while.

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) immediately leaves, heading back out the way they came in. Along the way they [pas](../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md)s through the room of [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) officers who look to the party for information about what is going on, but none is forthcoming.

## Checking on Sewer Entrances

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) agree to check the less guarded sewer entrances first as it is more likely to be targeted. They opt to head to the entrance near a right angled turn in a street.

On approach they decide to stealth closer, blending in with the crowd. Unfortunately their fame from the tournament catches the attention of an adolescent halfling who brings them to the attention of the nearby crowd, who then descend upon them in amazement.

In the excitement [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) notices a figure on a rooftop down the street disappear behind the top of the roof. She informs [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), who tells her she will distract the crowd while Ephaine investigates. Ahsha and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) begin playing to the crowd - Ahsha showing her strength by lifting children on her arm, Noon giving a vaudeville performance with impressions of [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) military higher-ups. As they continue to perform they continue to draw a crowd.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) uses Wild Shape to transform into a small bird and flies up to the roof where she saw the figure. She sees a dark skinned figure on the rooftop wearing hooded robes that closely match the colour of the roof tiles, as well as 2 other robed figures on nearby rooftops, covering all the angles of the street corner. She also notes the presence of [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) further round the street but away from its turn. Finally she notices a figure wearing a dark grey hood ([Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md)) open a faded blue door in the corner of the street, head inside, and close the door behind them. The building with the door has no windows.

Ephaine heads to the next building along and looks through the window, trying to get a sense of what's inside. She sees a middle class bedroom that looks unremarkable. Heading to a window sill on another floor she sees a similar sight. Unsatisfied, she checks on the hooded figures on the rooftop again, noticing the one that should be looking directly at the blue door is distracted by Ahsha and Noon.

Ephaine flies over that hooded figure, defecating on him, hitting him perfectly on the front of the hood, splashing across his face. He throws his hood back, revealing the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) leathers he is wearing underneath, and his non-elven rounded ears.

Happy with what she is seeing here, she flies over to the sewer entrance at the crossroads. Here she sees 6 hooded figures on rooftops covering all of the sight lines of the crossroads. She also spots the sewer manhole in the corner of the crossroad, with many pedestrians walking over it casually. Flying on to the third sewer entrance in the dead-end alley she finds a heavily guarded street. There is a blockade of [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) at the street entrance, hooded figures on the rooftops, and all of the windows overlooking the street are boarded up.

She flies back to the first sewer entrance and lands on the roof next to the hooded [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and ends her Wild Shape. This startles the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) who rolls onto their back and draws two daggers, despite Ephaine immediately asking him not to freak out and stating she is [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). She explains the potential spy attack conspiracy and asks if he has seen anything. He tells her she isn't allowed to be up here. When it becomes clear to Ephaine that he doesn't know that she is with Ahsha and Noon who are still entertaining down on the street, she gives a fuller explanation of who they are and what they're doing here.

When Ephaine asks the guard about the hooded figure she saw go through the blue door, he reports that he didn't see anyone. The [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) realises that he likely missed a detail he was charged to notice. He tells Ephaine that the sewer entrance is behind that door. Ephaine states that [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) will be going after them. He warns Ephaine that while he has to report the hooded figure, he will also need to report them if they enter - orders are orders. This does not bother Ephaine. He mimics a bird call, causing one of the other hooded [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) on a neighbouring rooftop to disappear as they go and sound the alarm.

Ephaine casts Misty Step to return to street level. She reconvenes with Ahsha and Noon, wasting no time telling them that they need to go. They follow Ephaine to the blue door.

## Behind the Blue Door

Approaching the door, [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) check if the door is trapped. Noon's affinity for this verifies that there is no danger to them. Ahsha opens the door, revealing a 10 ft x 15 ft room, 3 storeys tall - a building façade to hide the manhole cover from the street. The manhole cover is closed, but [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) notices that there has been some disturbance in the room recently. Noon closes the door and casts Dancing Lights, giving them a better look at the interior.

Ahsha opens the manhole cover, finding it moves easier than it perhaps should, indicating it has been moved a lot recently. The party makes their way down into the sewer, Ahsha leading the way. The ladder descends 30 ft to the sewer level.

The sewer here is much better formed than the one near [Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md)'s fighting pit. There are open flows of sewage flanked by narrow walkways. The sewage enters and exits pipes on either side of the long corridors. Occasionally the path is broken up by sewer pipes that must be traversed carefully, and there are occasional wooden planks crossing the spans.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) casts [Pas](../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md)s Without a Trace on the party, helping to conceal their presence. Ahsha leads the way around the corner, following a trail of recent footprints further along the tunnel and towards the light in the next section of the sewers.

As Ahsha emerges around the corner, she looks around the chamber. She fails to notice [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md) emerging from a small room across the sewer, who sees her and immediately breaks into a sprint, fleeing deeper into the sewer.

## Chasing the Hooded Figure

*[Initiative order begins]*

Xavier runs deeper into the sewer, disappearing around a corner before the party have a chance to react. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) sprints after him, closing the gap and getting a good view of him from behind, hood up. She shouts for him to stop, but he doesn't heed the warning. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) give chase. Ephaine casts Hold Person but Xavier resists it before continuing to disengage from Ahsha.

Ahsha manages to grapple Xavier, pulling his hood down and glimpsing his elven ears, confirming the party's suspicions. She also notices a commoner ([Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) under the effect of Disguise Self) leaning against the wall, who reacts to the scene with a shocked gasp. Ephaine and Noon close the gap, Ephaine preparing to strike if the situation deteriorates.

Xavier chooses not to struggle, instead pleading for Ahsha to stop as he doesn't wish to fight. This is an act to make him appear weak, which the party buys. Ahsha expresses a willingness to talk. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) uses Awakened Mind to telepathically communicate with Ahsha, telling her to be careful of "elven trickery". The commoner shuffles into the corner, cowering in fear.

Ahsha tells Xavier to start talking and demands that he tell them who he is. He tries to bargain, telling Ahsha that he'll tell them everything they want to know if he lets go of him - he won't run. Ephaine sternly tells Ahsha not to let go of him.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## Interrogating Xavier

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) ties [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md) up while [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) explains to him that it's for their own safety. Xavier is breathing heavily, giving the impression that he is scared. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) re-summons his Dancing Lights to illuminate the sewer tunnel.

Ahsha asks Xavier to start talking. He begins giving a truthful account of why he is here - to watch the tournament. Ephaine wonders why he needs to use the sewers in that case, to which Xavier says that it is too dangerous to be in the crowd at [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) due to who he knows is attending, alluding to the high-ranking [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) presiding over the event - [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) in particular.

Ephaine asks why he would risk his life and capture for a recreational event. He truthfully answers:

> We heard about the angel that fought in the last match.

When Ephaine tries to ask Xavier which person he considers to be the angel ([Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)), he is unable to provide a name. She presses, suggesting he is part of a conspiracy and is working with others. When she asks if he is alone, he tells her that he is alone down here (lie), but not in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) (lie).

Ahsha tells Ephaine to keep an eye on the commoner, worrying that they will overhear something that they're not supposed to. Ephaine tries to shoo them, but they cower in place, visibly shaking. Ephaine orders them up the ladder, threatening them with a "ball of flaming star gas". This only causes them to cower more under their arms. Ahsha suggests leaving them be. Ephaine continues to watch them.

Ahsha continues her questioning of Xavier. She wants to know why he is here and why it is worth risking his life. Ephaine reminds him that the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) and the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) are at war, so his presence here is particularly problematic.

Xavier begins talking. He provides his full name and states he is part of the Veritacris, and is here with [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) (first name) and [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md) (first name). He continues to insist that they are only here to see the angel. Ahsha finds him to be genuine.

Ephaine brings up the threats [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) had made against [Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md). When she says that Allisa has visited violence on Barthon, Xavier gets indignant, refuting the statement that any violence was done. He tells the party that they would never hurt someone, and that any threats they made were necessary for their survival, but were completely without substance.

Ahsha retorts by questioning why the half-elf corpse ([Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md)) possessed an [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md) military badge. Xavier doesn't know what became of Castien and is not aware that he was trying to break from the Veritacris and leave the city under his own principles. Xavier lies that their group do not impersonate or lie about who they are (while Allisa is disguised mere feet away from them), suggesting they only use sneaking and hiding tactics.

Ephaine explains the military badge they found on Castien. Xavier, not knowing that Castien is already dead, asks where he is. Ephaine bluntly breaks the news to him, but makes sure to state that the party didn't kill him and don't know how he died. Xavier is mournful and worried about his body and the Syntenne funeral rites that likely will not be carried out for him.

*[Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md):*
> Oh mother be with me. This is an awful thing that has happened.

Ephaine and Ahsha try to use Castien's body as leverage to get Xavier to tell them where [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) is right now. Xavier claims that she will be here soon, which prompts Ahsha to state that she doesn't know where the body is as a result. Xavier understands her meaning.

Noon and Ahsha swap places so that Noon can continue the interrogation. He starts to take on a partial Syntenne accent, trying to appeal to him. Noon tries a "good cop" routine, explaining that backup will be arriving soon that will be less happy about his presence in the sewers, but if Xavier is willing to give the party information the information they want, it might be possible for him to escape deeper into the sewers. Xavier by this point has dispensed with his frightened act, a wry smirk crossing his mouth. He tells Noon that he is already telling them what they want, so this works out well, as he should be let go for complying already.

Xavier tells the party that he isn't worried about the guards as Allisa will be here soon, and that there won't be any guards. The party interprets this as a threat. Xavier hammers home that Xavier and Allisa are incredibly determined to see the angel:

*[Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md):*
> Also let me make one thing clear. I do not think you understand how serious we are about seeing this match. I would give my life for Allisa. She has been searching for this person for over 100 years.

When Ahsha asks why, Xavier changes his tact. He asks the party if they think he is being honest with them before telling them that he is telling them nothing but the truth. Noon points out that he has yet to explain why they want to see the angel. He reiterates that they merely want to see her, but adds that their purpose here is to verify the existence of an angel one way or another. After that they would leave.

*[Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md):*
> And to answer your question: the reason she is searching for the angel and has been for 100 years, and has looked in the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) and the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) and the [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md) and now the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), is because she no longer wants to be alone.

This revelation floors Ahsha. She asks Xavier if [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) is an angel too. He nods, explaining that in elven the word for such a person is "[aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md)".

Ahsha pulls Ephaine and Noon to one side to discuss what they do with Xavier. Ephaine points out that he hasn't given them enough reason to let him go, as well as the implicit threat of no guards not sitting well with her. She argues that the party should take him back the way they came, out to the surface, and return him to [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) in accordance with their orders.

## Allisa Revealed

After some discussion, Ahsha binds Xavier, ties his hands and feet, covers his head entirely with his hood, and throws him over her shoulder. As she does so, Xavier speaks in elvish, knowing that Allisa will be able to hear it. He tells her to "leave him and go". Ephaine looks suspiciously toward the commoner in the corner, noticing that not only are they watching intently, but their appearance doesn't look natural and moves subtly in weird ways. She pre-emptively casts Bless on the party.

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) drops her Disguise Self spell, revealing her true form. She runs across the corner of the sewers, making a beeline for [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md) slung across [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md)' shoulder. While attempting to grab him she casts Dimension Door, opening a rectangular doorway in the middle of the space next to her, a portal to a unrecognised [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) street at sunset visible on the other side. Ahsha is able to keep hold of Xavier. Allisa chooses not contest it further, disappearing through the door which shuts behind her.

*[Initiative order ends]*

Not wanting to be surprised by any more magical trickery, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) shoves a gag in Xavier's mouth.

## Leaving the Sewers

The party make their way back the way they came, heading towards the sewer entrance ladder. As they turn the corner they see a group of [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) who have just descended into the sewers. They are quite jumpy, shouting for the party to identify themselves. Ahsha states that they are on [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) business, attempting to walk past them. Noon informs them that they are in pursuit of a suspect, asking the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) to accompany them.

The [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) leading the group sticks his arm out to prevent Ahsha from passing.
