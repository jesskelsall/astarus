## Sounding the Alarm

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) step back out into the courtyard outside of the building they hid [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md)'s corpse in. They notice that the streets are busier than when they entered the sewers, the final day of the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival attracting its largest crowd yet.

Wishing to sound the alarm on what they've found and heard from [Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md), they head to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), looking for [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md). At the side entrance they are stopped by a mix of [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) guarding the door. The [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) asks if they are on the guest list, [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) persuading them to get help, particularly as the group looks very rough. When the member asks what's going on, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) insists that it's need-to-know [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) business, and they get the message.

With an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) heading inside to get help, the [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) with the guest list expresses their failed desire to be an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md), revealing an arm covered in scars from bite wounds. They place a hand on [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md)'s shoulder and use their druidic magic to cast Cure Wounds.

The [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) that went to get help returns, informing the party that [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) isn't inside, despite being on the guest list - though it is roughly 5 hours until the [Nature's Battle 27](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-27.md) final match. Ephaine asks if [Samantha Ilis](../characters/samantha-ilis.md) is inside, but that name is not found on the guest list. She then asks for [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) who isn't here before the [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) tells them that [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) is here.

The party accompany the [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) into [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), leading them along a grand corridor then through a room where many [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) officers are relaxing and socialising. Beyond is another grand room, with [Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md) and [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) at its center, quietly conversing.

As the [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) barges through the double doors into this room, Legacy demands to know why they are being interrupted. Noon speaks up, insisting that their business is important. Legacy demands they get on with it if that is the case. Noon explains that the party have discovered a [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) plot that could be targeting the tournament. Legacy beckons over an [Astornox guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) who he instructs to fetch [Tanin Arnous](../characters/tanin-arnous.md) at once.

Ephaine provides Legacy with the [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md) military badge that she found on [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md)'s corpse, as well as one of his ears. He is emotionless as he examines both items, but then immediately shouts to the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in earshot:

*[Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md):*

> Lock the building, now!

The room erupts into chaos as the enlisted [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in the room scramble to figure out what is going on and lock down the building. Into the room enters [Tanin Arnous](../characters/tanin-arnous.md) who comes straight over to Legacy, asking what is going on. Tanin and Legacy exchange glances as Legacy reveals the half-elf ear wrapped in a napkin. Tanin demands the party succinctly explain what is going on.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) tells Tanin that they believe [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spies are using the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers to disrupt the tournament. Ephaine and Noon explain that they found a half-elven corpse in a section of the sewers that they believe runs directly under [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md). Tanin is dismissive of the news of an already dead elf.

Ephaine tries to explain that they learned from someone ([Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md)) about [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spies that have already infiltrated [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md). When Tanin asks for his name, Ephaine gives it willingly, understanding that this might upset Ahsha. Neither Tanin or Legacy recognise the name. When Ephaine suggests that Barthon has likely fled the city already, Legacy orders Tanin to fetch a truthseeker. When Legacy asks Ephaine where Barthon was last seen, she is unable to explain where the building they were in was. Ahsha chooses not to divulge details. Legacy becomes frustrated with the lack of usable information being provided.

Ephaine tries to salvage the situation by divulging some details of what Barthon told them. She informs Legacy of [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), the presumed ring leader of the spies, who has been threatening Barthon and appearing at his house.

She once again suggests that an attack on the tournament could be afoot. Legacy is confident that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) have the arena protected. Ephaine asks where there might be an attack vector, but Legacy refuses to discuss security weaknesses. Ahsha and Ephaine implore Legacy to at least do something. He concedes, asking Tanin if there are any more [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) to spare.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) suggests that [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) could help. Legacy sneers down his nose at Ahsha, but she meets his gaze, not taking his intimidation.

*[Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md):*

> Okay. You think you're all that? Well, I suggest you get back out there and come back with some more useful information. Or even better yet, some people in chains. Because if you don't, and if I have my way, you won't have a badge by the end of today.

[Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md), who has been standing back and listening in this entire time, steps forward and touches his hand to Legacy's side, sternly stating:

*[Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md):*

> You won't have your way, that's not your jurisdiction.

[Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md) gives Ronvyn some serious side-eye before excusing himself to go and bark orders at the [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) still present in the corner of the room. Ronvyn reintroduces himself, explaining that they've met before at the tournament's opening meeting.

## Formulating a Plan

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) once again offers [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)'s help in any way possible. [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) points out the mess that the next few hours will be thanks to the party, and concedes that Legacy was right about one thing - the situation will go smoother for them if they are able to find more evidence of spies or a plot.

Ronvyn asks the squad where in the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) structure they sit. Ephaine explains they are assigned to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), under the command of [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md). Ronvyn thanks them for bringing the situation to his attention, imploring them to get back onto the streets and investigate what might be going on. He orders the squad to report to him directly for the time being. When Ahsha asks for aid before they head out, Ronvyn casts Mass Healing Word (*"bark"*) on the party.

Ronvyn gives an overview of [Astornox guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) placement within the city. He notes that the guards are mostly stationed around [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), leaving the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md) nearby and the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) Stronghold on the city outskirts less protected than usual. He expresses a desire to send some [Astorrel guards](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) back to the stronghold just in case.

When Noon once again presses the importance of the sewers, Ronvyn rolls out a map of the city on a nearby table. He waves is hand over it, casting Illusory Script to reveal glowing blue lines representing the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers. They animate slightly, showing the direction the sewage travels through the system. Ahsha is able to point to the courtyard outside of the building they descended into the sewers from, allowing Ronvyn to trace the sewers from there towards the arena. He shows the party that the section of the sewers they were in isn't closely connected to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) or either of the strongholds. Ronvyn is generous with the privileged information of the sewer system, even showing the party how one could get into the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md).

He goes on to highlight a few sewer access points that lead to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md).

| Outside | Arena Access | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dead end | Leads into storage rooms under arena stands, next to arena floor. | Has the most guards of all the entrances. |
| Crossroads | | |
| Right angle | | |

Ephaine is keen to learn about which direction the sewage flows through these sections. Ronvyn explains that the sewage flows away from the arena which considered sanitation when it was built. When Ephaine asks about the sewage flow near where they found [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md)'s corpse, he reveals that upstream from there leads out of the city. When the party gets caught up in thinking about if the spies have a way of getting into the city via the sewers, Ronvyn tells them to focus on the threat against the tournament, as the [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) will be redistributed by tomorrow and can help with issues away from the arena.

When [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) takes a side bar to discuss what they should do, they realise that it's not their decision to make and defer to Ronvyn. He makes it official that their orders are to search around the sewers connected to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), and to report back before the tournament starts. He assures the party that he will make the effort worth their while.
