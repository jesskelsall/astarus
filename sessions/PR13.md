## Battle Aftermath

While [Morog Whiteknuckle](../characters/morog-whiteknuckle.md) and his bandit troupe left with the last 2 horses, heading south, the party licked their wounds and evaluated their situation.

Sustaining heavy injuries, the party realised the scope of their wounds.

- [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md): Blunt force trauma from clubs.
- [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md): Bloodied arm and chest from greataxe slices.
- [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md): Not injured, but sore from horseback combat, and from falling off her horse.
- [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md): Wounded from multiple sources.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) came to consciousness, instinctively using Fey Presence to frighten [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) who was within range. She checks that the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) is still on her person, which it is - it doesn't appear [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) had any want of it.

Torbra salvages the 2 dead horses for meat, retrieving 4 rations.

The party debates what they should do next, and the loss of [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md). With many of the party having business in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), and knowing that there is an opportunity to seek [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) from the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) there, they endeavour to continue on their journey to the capital.

The plain is to continue to [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) and look to get a boat that they can take down river to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md).

## Resting Overnight

### 18:00

Rather than heading into [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) overnight, the party decides to sleep out on the grassy plains before resuming their journey in the morning. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) uses Mold Earth to form a hut from the party's cart which remains on its side.

Here the party makes a campfire and turns in for the night.

*[Long rest]*

### 07:00

The party prepares for their day, gathering their equipment and cooking the horse meat on the camp fire, nourishing themselves for the day.

## Arriving at [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md)

### 08:30

The party finishes the journey to [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md), walking for 30 minutes across the grassy plains and into the edge of town. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) doesn't disguise herself.

Heading down the main riverside street in [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md), they decide to split into 2 groups:

- [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md): Searching for a boat.
- [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md): Buying supplies.

## Buying Supplies

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) checks the map and determines that the journey to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) will roughly take a few days.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) find [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) General, one building before [The Greedy Trout](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-greedy-trout.md). They head inside and are greeted by the shopkeeper who initially remarks at their bloody clothing. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) convinces here that it was wolves that attacked them. The shopkeeper remarks that there must have been a lot of them.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) buys:
- 4 robes (3 gp 5 sp)
- 12 rations (6 gp)
- 1 bedroll (1 gp)

Once finished, they begin to make their way towards the inn.

## Searching for a Boat

Torbra and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) find [Oleg Purley](../characters/oleg-purley.md) on one of the docks along the river's edge. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) goes to talk to him about buying a boat. Oleg is taken aback by [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s height, particularly as he is a halfling.

He tells the pair that he has a boat for sale for 50 gp, or they could hire it providing they bring it back within a week. Torbra remarks that they (her and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)) don't have enough money to buy it outright, and they don't believe they'd be able to return the boat in time based on the length of the journey.

With some information about their options, they make their way towards the inn.

## [The Greedy Trout](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-greedy-trout.md)

The party meets back up along the main street and heads into [The Greedy Trout](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-greedy-trout.md) to enjoy a drink before they head off. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md), particularly keen, pushes the door open first.

While in the doorway she notices 2 [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) talking to someone behind the bar. She freezes in place, whispering "[Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md)" to the party.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) turns around and walks along the main street, wanting to leave the area without appearing too suspicious. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) heads inside, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and Torbra following behind.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) inconspicuously makes her way to the bar, putting her hood up and avoiding the guards. She waits for the bartender to come to her, and doesn't attempt to eavesdrop their conversation.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and Torbra find a table under the mezzanine that's a distance from the bar, over by a wall. They sit down and wait for [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md).

Eventually the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) leave the bar, looking around at the patrons before heading through the corridor to access the upper level. At this time the innkeeper [Mordus Shren](../characters/mordus-shren.md) comes over to serve [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md).

She orders 3 ales (2 sp) before asking about the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). She successfully persuades Mordus to tell her about what they wanted. They both lean in for a quiet conversation.

Mordus tells her that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are looking for someone "tall and blue" ([Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)), as well as someone with "grey skin" (Torbra). They are going upstairs to check the rooms. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) exclaims that "tall and blue" sounds ridiculous, and Mordus reluctantly agrees. 

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) joins [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and Torbra at their table. She tells them that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are looking for [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), someone "tall and blue". She suggests that they quickly finish their drinks and leave the village. They begin discussing how they're going to approach buying the boat, and if they can afford it. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) explains that she can easily pay for it.

## [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) Wanders Off

Simultaneously, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) walks off down the main road to put some distance between her and the [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md). As she goes she gets perplexed and surprised looks from passers by, some of which she waves to.

Making her way past the edge of the village, she finds some bushes to pick berries from, lingering here in peace. Eventually she makes a flower crown which she wears around her head.

## [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) Sighted

One of the villagers that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) walked past, knowing that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) is looking for someone large and blue, bursts through the door of [The Greedy Trout](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-greedy-trout.md) and shouts:

> The blue woman! The blue woman! She's here! She's here!

After a moment, the 2 [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) run down the stairs and back to the entryway, running over to the woman and exclaiming:

> Where? Take us, now!

They rush her out of the building and into the street.

The party, realising the bind they are now in and the limited time they have before the situation becomes worse, down their drinks (Torbra: 1, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md): 2) and rush back out into the main street, trying to figure out where [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is.

## Finding [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)

The party observes the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) running down the street in the direction that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) headed. The woman who informed them of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s presence is seen sighing and moving into a side street, her job done.

After briefly considering interfering with the guards who are running away at speed and are too far away, the party decides to head in the same direction in search of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).

Throughout the search, the [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) can be seen going between the streets at a run, trying to find [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). At points they are seen knocking on doors and shouting.

Reaching the edge of the village, the party splits up and fans out, each going down a different street in search of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) eventually finds her over by some bushes outside of the village. It takes her 30 minutes to find her. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) tells [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) of the guards searching for her, urging her to disguise herself and to come with them to the dock so they can leave.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), up until this point oblivious to the danger to the party, transforms into a small old man, trying to sound elderly.

## Leaving [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md)

Meeting back up at the edge of the village as agreed, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) briefly pretends to be someone else, much to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and Torbra's confusion. Eventually she comes clean, and the group heads back along the main road towards where [Oleg Purley](../characters/oleg-purley.md) was.

As they proceed, one of the [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) exits a side street in front of the party, looking in their direction. At a glance he doesn't recognise Torbra, and runs off, continuing his search.

The party convinces Torbra to meet them on the edge of the village downstream, back near where they found [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). This will minimise the risk that the guards recognise one of them. They agree to pick her up using the boat.

Back at the dock, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) pays Oleg 50 gp using the money pouch that [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) paid her for [finding the Goldreach Meteorite](../storylines/ended/finding-the-goldreach-meteorite.md) for him. Oleg explains that the boat is a bit further along the dock, with oars, ready to go.

The party gets into the boat, two rowing while the third watches where they're going. They steer the boat downstream, heading in the same direction as several transport boats that are heading towards [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md).

Eventually they come across Torbra who hops in the boat. The party shuffles around so that Torbra and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) can row.

They continue rowing downstream, heading towards [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) disappears around a bend in the river, and they have the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) to themselves for a time.
