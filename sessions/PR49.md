## Battling the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md)

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) continues its fight against the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) in the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) crater in [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md). Three [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) and one [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) battle against the party and [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) while the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md), approximating the appearance of [Gillian Close](../characters/gillian-close.md), commands the battlefield.

*[Initiative order resumes]*

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) casts Scorching Ray at the hunter that [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is attacking, hitting it with all three beams, causing some of its [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to atomise into the air. While doing so she backs up away from the crater's edge. That hunter slices twice at Torbra but fails to find purchase. The other charges at her and attempts to knock her over but fails and can't land either hits with its blades. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) retaliates by firing two Eldritch Blast beams, one at each, hitting the one that charged, knocking it backwards but doing little damage.

The [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md), its body still surging with ever-rising [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) that approximates a humanoid form, solidifies the dust at the ends of its arms, producing two small blades that strike at [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md). The attack isn't telegraphed, the arms striking forward at her despite the appearance that its body is facing away from her. Nevertheless it misses with both blades. As their swing ends, the blades collapse to the ground and lose their solid form while the mind forms new arms. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) reacts by backing up out of danger.

The [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) runs across the crater towards Saoirse. It teleports, appearing in front of her with its blades raised, swinging down instantly. Both impact, the shock of the strikes breaking her concentration on her [Sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) spell that was in effect on Torbra. The frost magic in her Armour of Agathys races down her chest in reaction to the strike, freezing the blades in place. The watcher recoils, but in doing so loses its blades which remain stuck to Saoirse's chest for a second before their form disintegrates and collapses to her feet. She watches as [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) ripples from the back of its body to its front, creating two new blades before the creature teleports back to its original location.

For the second time the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) causes the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) covering the entire crater floor to swell, rising in height around Torbra and [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to 2ft tall. Both are swept off their feet as the dust surges towards the mind, the pair falling to the ground. Meanwhile [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) casts Scorching Ray at the first [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md), all but one beams hitting their mark. She moves herself between Saoirse and Thanea in a defensive stance.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) continues to flee from the crater, shouting at Allisa to "fuck up" the creatures she is escaping from, or heal her. Torbra stands and swings her halberd at the hunter before her while reorienting herself closer to the party. She manages to connect once in the process. Thanea casts Fire Bolt at it while Torbra circles it. It impacts its back, causing most of its back spines to collapse along with one of its hind legs, which slowly starts to reform. The hunter looks to be struggling to stay apart.

The [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) retaliates by slashing Torbra twice, cutting deeply with both, but at the cost of one of its blade arms collapsing to dust. The second hunter charges out of the crater and rushes towards Thanea, knocking her prone before striking. Both blades come down hard on her, her Restore Balance removing some of its advantage, but both catch the sides of her torso in its attempt to skewer her into the ground. Saoirse blasts it with Eldritch Blast, pushing it to the top of the crater's edge.

The [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) moves back into the crater before teleporting to Allisa, but both of its blades come down onto her shield, held at the ready vigilantly for such an occasion.

## Avatar of Saoirse

The [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) manipulates the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) in the crater, causing plumes of it to rise and fall, seemingly at random. One plume envelops the injured [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) in front of Torbra, taking its form with it, nothing remaining. The mind itself stops raising dust from the crater floor, its form disappearing quickly as it begins to re-form on the opposite side of the crater, this time giving the appearance of [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) herself. Two more [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) appear as two plumes of dust subside, joining the original one in the crater.

Both [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and Saoirse herself notice the new appearance and its uncanny resemblance to Saoirse.

## [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md)' Protection

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) moves closer to [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) before casting a spell from her staff (Guardian of Faith). Radiant light is emitted from the blue gem at its end, causing two tendrils of incorporeal radiance to swirl and coalesce from above into a single point on the ground in front of Saoirse. From it two radiant wings erupt, expanding in size and rising upwards while they take shape. They form into giant wings of a bird of prey, made of geometric shapes that cast yellow, orange, and red light through it, like light shining through faceted gemstones. This light is cast on the ground below the three in prismatic patterns as the wings finish outstretching, now 10ft wide each. The visage of [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md)' wings offers protection to those beneath them.

## Battling the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md)

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) begins running towards the group underneath the giant wings, casting Bane as she goes, affecting the closest [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) and the remaining [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) underneath the wings. She shouts at [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) to "fuck shit up".

Torbra, unsettled by the presence of the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) masquerading as [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), charges directly at it. She swings her halberd but it passes cleanly through the constantly moving [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), its only effect to carry some of the dust to the side with the swing of the blade. Torbra is stunned momentarily, unsure of how to proceed, while Saoirse yells at her to get out of the dust. Torbra remains in front of the mind, repositioning so others can still see it.

Thanea stands and kicks off from the ground, flying on her Radiant Soul wings into the air. She casts Fireball, growing a large orb of fire in front of her hands before heaving it downwards into the middle of the three [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md). It explodes into a ball of flame as it connects with the crater floor, enveloping all three and barely avoiding both the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) and Torbra. When it subsides, the closest watcher is nowhere to be seen, having perished and scattered onto the crater floor with the rest of the dust. The other two suffer from the fire damage.

The [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) begins burning under the radiance of Guardian of Faith but is unbothered, charging round to Thanea's position and swiping up with its blade arms. It finds purchase with both, skewering her lower chest and pulling her to the ground. As the blades pierce she falls unconscious, her wings vanishing as she collapses without resistance. Saoirse blasts it with Eldritch Blast twice, the first doing nothing as it turns into a cloud of dust to avoid it. The second blast impacts as intended, knocking it from over Thanea's body. Saoirse spits blackened necrotic blood towards the hunter.

The [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md), staring at Torbra before it, reforms its anti-magic bubble. This is only perceptible to Torbra as a brief flash of purple from its already purple glowing eyes. Both [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) teleport to Torbra's side, each of the four hits cutting her as intended before they both teleport back to the middle of the crater. Both then strategically spread themselves out across the crater, wary of another Fireball.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) pushes her staff holding arm towards the hunter, the staff's gem facing upwards, before spinning the staff upside down as she casts Hold Person on the creature. Its hardened body locks in place, unable to retaliate to Saoirse's blast. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) rushes over to Thanea and attempts medical aid, applying pressure to her bleeding wounds and pulling her garments tighter over them. She feels like she is helping (death save success).

Torbra activates her Frost Rune before swinging twice at the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) again, determined to do it damage through sheer willpower alone. She swipes through its unmoving form, clearly not worried by her strike, which once again does no damage. Testing what it can do, she backs up, provoking it to form a blade arm and slice her across her arm. She continues to head towards the crater's edge.

The [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) remains stuck in place, unable to shake Hold Person. Saoirse urges Allisa to help Thanea, who responds that she will try through the strain she is under focusing on holding the spiny creature in place. Saoirse, sensing an excellent opportunity to inflict some damage, runs over to the hunter and stabs it in the face with her dagger, scoring an easy chunk of damage.

Both [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) teleport to Torbra and slash her, hitting her three times including once critically, wounding her severely. They both teleport back to the middle of the crater near the mind.

## Battling the [Meteoric Drones](../creatures/meteoric-drone.md)

The [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) causes plumes of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to erupt from the crater floor yet again, returning the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) to its reserve of dust. In their place four [Meteoric Drones](../creatures/meteoric-drone.md) form, their makeup as a headless torso with four arms and two legs completely alien to the party. Dust swirls from the floor to their backs, forming a figure of eight that gives the impression of hummingbird wings.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) casts Aid on [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), returning Thanea to consciousness in the process. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) circles the party to get a thrust of her rapier into the held [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md). Bolsters by her success she follows up with her dagger. Both attacks do little, but the easy opening maximises its potential.

Saoirse calls for Torbra to kill the hunter while it is held, so she rushes out of the crater and over to it, slashing at it twice with her halberd. Both hits land critically in its held state, carving up its sides. She surges to attack twice more, bringing her weight down on its torso. It is sliced in three, the second hit collapsing the torso pieces to the ground where it instantly loses its form and disassembles into its constituent [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md).

Thanea stands, wasting no time to cast Fireball on the [Meteoric Drone](../creatures/meteoric-drone.md) closest to the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md). The erupting blast catches three drones and the mind in its area, destroying two of them instantly. The mind, severely weakened by [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) it has created, runs out of magical energy and scatters across the crater itself. Immediately the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) comprising the crater floor stops moving and settles.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> The thing is gone. What's happening?

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Well you obviously fixed it.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> I don't think it's dead...

With only two [Meteoric Minds](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) left, both take flight above the crater and towards the party. Both raise all four of their hands, palms outstretched, firing Magic Missiles towards the party. The homing bolts of force energy hit Allisa, Saoirse, Thanea, and [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) twice each. Saoirse's Armour of Agathys is broken while Thanea falls unconscious again.

Saoirse hexes the closest done before responding in kind, pointing a beam of Eldritch Blast at each simultaneously, hitting both and pushing them backwards through the air. She runs to the nearby large rocks to take cover.

Allisa casts Scorching Ray, sending three beams to the drone on the left, and only one to the other which was caught in Thanea's Fireball. One beam strikes each drone. The one on the right begins to plummet from the ground, losing its form half way down and hitting the ground as a pile of falling dust.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) moves closer to the remaining drone before sliding to her knees and throwing her dagger up to it. It impacts its chest, causing a hole of rapidly expanding loose [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to form which begins overtaking its form. As it reaches its arm joints its body loses form and begins collapsing to the ground. The thud of three still intact limbs can be heard as it reaches the ground, its entire form now dust settled on the crater floor.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## Battle Aftermath

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) rushes over to [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md). She drops to her knees and throws away her shield, intent on bringing her back to consciousness. Reaching for her [Citrine Eye Necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md) reflexively she realises it is no longer in her possession, instead using the end of her staff on Thanea's head to cast Aid, returning her to consciousness. Thanea's first sight is of Allisa's metal facemask looming over her. Thanea instinctively tries to stand but Allisa places a reassuring hand on her shoulder.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> It's over. We won.

Thanea thanks her. Allisa encourages her to rest, but Thanea insists on standing.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) collectively begin investigating the crater, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) starting by retrieving her thrown dagger.

| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | |

Saoirse is unable to find anything amongst the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). While searching she realises that the entire crater floor is [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), and that the creatures were being formed from it. Its sheer quantity worries her.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s foot catches a metal belt buckle devoid of the rest of the belt. She digs deeper,discovering a potion of healing. She digs around further in that area but finds nothing more.

Torbra uses the spike of her halberd to feel around for anything that isn't dust, sweeping it across the floor gently. Eventually she hears metal on metal and stops to investigate. Digging through the dust she spots a long strip of metal, stopping herself in time to avoid getting cut by the blade of a longsword. Grabbing its unearthed pommel she pulls it from the ground, revealing a plain looking sword with an unusual cross guard made of teeth ([Verlust](../items/magic/verlust.md)).

She thinks on the blade, recognising its dwarven design style, but still finding the addition of teeth bizarre. In examining it she checks its weighting, finding it to be well balanced, before giving the weapon a practice swing. As it swings through the air the blade ignites, leaving an arc of fire in its wake that dissipates as quickly as it formed. As the blade stops moving, all trace of fire is gone.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> Holy shit.
