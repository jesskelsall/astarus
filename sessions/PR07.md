*This session was offered so that the boss fight in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) against the Meteoric Watchers could be played out earlier than the next weekly Wednesday session.*

## Fighting the Meteoric Watchers

### Round 1

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) begins combat by drawing her crossbow and casting Expeditious Retreat. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts False Life to gain temporary hit points. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) in badger form burrows into the rocks below her. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) runs across the difficult terrain with ease, action surging to dash and then attacking with her longsword. It deals less damage than expected due to the watcher’s resistance to slashing damage. Torbra then turns and runs, triggering an attack of opportunity.

The Meteoric Watcher takes a slice at Torbra. It uses its hands to lift its front off of the ground before slicing inwards with both blade arms at once, connecting with her for damage.

On its turn the watcher runs over to [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and attempts to slice her, but misses.

### Round 2

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) casts False Life on herself at will, having seen [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) do the same last round. She then puts away her crossbow. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts Sleep precisely so that it only affects the watcher, but it has no effect. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) continues burrowing slowly in the direction of the meteorite. Torbra attempts another swing and misses.

The watcher once again attacks [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) with its blade arms, connecting and dealing some damage.

### Round 3

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) sprints over to the meteorite as fast as she can. She looks at the meteorite, observing it is 1ft in diameter and that it is seemingly perfectly spherical. Because it is glowing so brightly it isn’t possible to see any details in it.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts Fireball on the watcher, hitting it point-blank, engulfing its head in flames briefly, knocking it off its footing and causing it damage. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) uses wild shape to turn into a draft horse, sending rocks flying in every direction as she bursts out of the ground. Torbra swings again at the watcher, missing again.

The first meteoric watcher vanishes from in front of [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and Torbra’s eyes, pulling air into the void which it has left, before reappearing next to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md), displacing the air next to her. It attempts to slice her but misses.

The second meteoric watcher then teleports in behind [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), once again displacing the air where it does so. It immediately slices at [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), damaging her behind.

### Round 4

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) leaps onto the meteorite in an attempt to cover the light it is emitting. She falls belly-first onto it, connecting with it against her belly. She fails the wisdom saving throw (natural 1) for coming into close contact with the meteorite and falls unconscious with meteoridis. Only Torbra sees this as it happens. Robin is given the list of meteoridis compulsions which now affect [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md).

As this happens, the orb stops glowing, removing the purple glow from the cave, though it is still light enough to see due to the hole in the ceiling letting the daylight in.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts fireball on the first watcher by [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and the meteorite. Hannah rolls a natural 20, doubling the quantity of dice being rolled, and dealing a fair amount of damage. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) kicks one of the watchers with her hooves. Torbra swings round to the back of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and attacks the watcher there with her longsword, but misses. She then uses her second wind to regain some of her health back.

The first watcher (next to an unconscious [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md)) raises its torso, placing all of its weight onto its back legs. Its movements are peculiar, switching from flesh and bone movements to mechanical construct-like movements, allowing it to rotate and contort its limbs and torso in unnatural ways. It attacks [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) with a force blast generated from between its hands, damaging her. She succeeds the strength saving throw and keeps her footing. The second watcher turns to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and slices at her, damaging her.

## [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md)’s Meteoridis Dream

> The darkness slowly clears and your senses return to you.
>
> It remains dark - it’s night and you are outside. From all around you hear the gentle rustling of grass, and straining for a second you can see it at your feet, stretching out in every direction as far as you can make out.
>
> Then you glance up and are immediately captivated by the night sky. Stars. So many stars. Were there always this many?
>
> After a moment it dawns on you - the moon isn’t out, but the sky is so bright. Not so bright as to illuminate the land beneath it, but bright enough that it’s noticeable. It feels like emerging from a dark space into the daylight, but that feeling doesn’t come to an end.
>
> You feel... empty, wanting. The place you were before felt right, you just want to go back there. Anywhere that brings you closer. Anywhere that makes you feel... whole again.
>
> Looking back up at the sky you notice something changing. One of the stars is moving from left to right - slowly but surely. At first you thought it was just your imagination, but with each passing second you become more sure of what you’re seeing. Then you notice a second, then a third, then a fourth... ten, twenty... too many to count.
>
> They’re all on the move, and they’re moving together. Arcing downwards as they travel, they keep picking up speed. And behind each one, a brilliant white trail, illuminating the sky with a million trails, all moving in concert.
>
> The stars continue to speed up. You raise your finger to follow one of them, causing you to move your finger past your face from one side of your face to the other within a few seconds. But they keep speeding up. Faster and faster. Gradually and almost unnoticeably.
>
> But as they do, the trails are darkening. Darker and darker. Wait no, that’s not darker, that’s colour. They’re changing colour. They’re going... purple? The faster they go, the more purple they become. Faster and faster, more and more purple.
>
> The darkness returns...

## Combat Continues

### Round 5
[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) shoots the first watcher with Ray of Frost, firing a ray of frost which smashes into the face and chest of the watcher, leaving it somewhat shaken. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) kicks the second watcher again. Torbra slices the second watcher, this time hitting it. Her blade drags like metal on stone, not getting much purchase and feeling strange compared to slicing into flesh, but leaving a mark as it goes.

Both watchers teleport away, out of sight.

### Round 6

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) moves to a new position and uses the dodge action to avoid any incoming attacks. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) moves over to the meteorite next to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and also dodges. Torbra also rushes over to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and attempts to wake her up, but fails the medicine check, shaking her to no effect. The meteorite rolls out from under her.

The meteorite is round and grey, smooth and featureless. It reminds the party of the creatures. There is a visible crack with a small open hole.

The first watcher teleports back in on the edge of the crater, while the second teleports back in behind [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md), but takes no further action.

### Round 7

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts fireball on the second watcher which is now right behind her. As she begins to attack it opens its eyes once again, glowing bright purple and piercing into her, attempting to distract her from her attack. She fails on the wisdom saving throw, imposing disadvantage on her attack roll, but she hits anyway. As the watcher reconfigures after taking damage, it takes longer than usual to do so and a small part of it falls off.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) kicks down at the orb, causing it to fly across the crater and bounce around briefly. As soon as this happens, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) regains consciousness, still prone. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) then licks [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) in the face.

Torbra runs over to the second watcher which is next to [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and slices at it with a sideways swing. Her sword grinds across its surface as if across stone, but half way along her swing the resistance disappears and she nearly throws her sword, as the watcher disintegrates into a gravelly dust on the floor before her.

The second watcher teleports away from its spot on the edge of the crater and reappears directly in front of Torbra, slicing immediately but missing.

### Round 8

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) stands up and casts Eldritch Blast at the remaining watcher. Rolling a natural 1 she not only misses but some of the force of the blast surges backwards and knocks her back to prone. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts fireball but misses. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) gallops over to the meteorite and attempts to kick it again but misses. Torbra attempts to grapple the watcher but fails due to it contorting and rotating out of her grasp.

The watcher teleports on the opposite side of the crater away from the group.

### Round 9

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) moves over to the meteorite and picks it up. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts another fireball against the watcher which connects with its torso, causing it to fall to the ground. It takes longer to get up than last time. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) gallops over to it and kicks it again. While reconfiguring again, one of its blade arms falls off completely. Torbra runs over and swings her sword at it, grazing its shoulder.

The watcher teleports again, reappearing next to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) before slicing at her with its one remaining blade arm, doing a small amount of damage.

### Round 10

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) casts Eldritch Blast at the watcher right in front of her. It flies 5ft backwards, turning into dust as it goes.

## Aftermath

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) looks more closely at the orb. She sees that it is made of a grey stone-like material, uniform in shape and smoothness with few imperfections. It is cold to the touch. There is an area 2in wide that has a zig-zag hairline crack that splits into two lines, with the junction between them exposing an opening into the meteorite’s interior. Inside the surface is much rougher. It contains some pieces of the meteorite’s external surface as well as a fine powdery dust made of the same material. It is clear to her that it is made of the same material as the watchers themselves.

She uses sleight of hand to tip the dust into one of her pouches and succeeds in not being seen. This happens before [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) comes over to take a look for herself.

Torbra begins investigating the bodies. There are 6 of them, 3 of which were the adventurers they spotted yesterday near [Hurley Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hurley-farm.md). In total there are 5 adventurer types with the remaining person appearing common. She finds: 3 short-swords, 3 daggers, and a maul. She takes the maul.
