## Exiting the Cave

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) continues searching through the bodies and finds:

- 14 gp, 26 sp, and 16 cp.
- Potion of Invulnerability (correctly identified).

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) scoops up some of the grey dust that remains of one of the slain [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md). She is able to but it is mixed in with gravel from the crater and is hard to identify. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) approaches [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) to examine the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) for herself, which [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) lets her examine, before handing it back to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md). [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) carries it wrapped up in a cloth dangling by her side from her belt.

The group spends some time investigating the cave, making their way back to the previous chamber. They are concerned that there may be an additional watcher that may have escaped (especially because of what happened in [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)’s dream), but find no evidence of the watchers leaving the cave. It becomes apparent that the watchers came up from the cave and violently forced the wolves from their den.

The group takes a short rest before making their way back out to the surface.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) explains that she doesn’t remember much of what happened around her passing out by the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), and is just relieved that she didn’t die. The party resolves to return to [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) with what they’ve found and seen. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) is wary about returning to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) in case her dream comes true and the town burns down.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) remains a draft horse and attempts to leave the cave as one. At the narrow exit to the cave she tries to force her way through before almost getting stuck. Torbra tries to push her but it doesn’t achieve much. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts Minor Illusion to make a loud bang sound in front of her face in order to scare her, which causes her to kick Torbra in the chest, knocking her backwards and dealing damage.

After edging back out [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) then turns back into her regular firbolg form, explaining that she sometimes gets carried away as the animal she is wild shaped into. She then wild shapes into a cat to get through the narrower cave section, hopping onto [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md)’s shoulder on the way out.

## Heading Back to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md)

### 15:00

The party makes their way out of the 5ft drop and back into the forest.

They make their way back out of the forest the way they came in, moving at a fast pace but not quite running. The marching order is [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md)/[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md), Torbra.

Heading south east towards [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), the party bypasses [Hurley Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hurley-farm.md) and moves on towards [Nightcrest Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/nightcrest-farm.md).

### 21:00

The party arrives at [Nightcrest Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/nightcrest-farm.md) as the sun begins to set on a summer’s evening. They decide to see if they’re able to secure lodging here for the night on their way back.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) knocks on the door but gets no answer. She knocks again, again with no answer. The party heads round the back of the house and through the gate into the inner courtyard.

The courtyard is unremarkable and as they remembered it. Torbra sees some flecks of blood in the middle of the courtyard, concentrated in one spot. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) spots the back door to the house ajar and one of the ploughs abandoned in the field and suspects foul play.

She checks the house, finding a haphazard poor farmhouse used as much for storage as it is for living, with a few items out of place. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) also takes a look. The fire appears to have been lit at some point today but has since gone out.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) goes to check on the lean-to where the home made keg of beer is housed and finds the keg empty but slightly damp, ready for reuse. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) examines the blood and finds it to be fresh but drying, concentrated in one spot and drop-like rather than a splash.

## [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) Approach

### 21:30

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is not disguised and appears as a firbolg.

Two [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) shout at the party to catch their attention. They approach from between the house and the courtyard and enter through the gate that the party entered through.

They inform the party that they’re not allowed to be here as the farm is off limits, Captain’s orders, and to clear off.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) mentions that they are on a mission for [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) and are looking for someone to sleep. This catches the lead guard’s attention before they discuss something between themselves (planning what to do with them). Nobody is fully able to overhear their discussion.

The [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) offer to accompany them back to [Holyrook Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/holyrook-farm.md) before the lead guard nods to the second one, who leaves in the direction of town at a brisk pace. The lead guard summons [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) who joins the group. Everyone gathers up and follows this guard on the walk to [Holyrook Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/holyrook-farm.md), occasionally turning around to make sure everyone is staying together.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) asks the guard what happened to the farm. The guard is persuaded to divulge that the farmer is a suspected traitor for harbouring [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) and has been imprisoned in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md). They were sent out this afternoon to find out what he knew but he resisted, so he was taken away. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) tried to push for more information but was rebuffed.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is suspicious that neither guard has mentioned her firbolg form yet.

## At the Bridge

### 22:00

Heading south from [Nightcrest Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/nightcrest-farm.md) the guard and party cross the bridge over the stream, which they had crossed on their way towards the forest.

Two adventurer types are seen heading towards them along the path. They have swords but don’t appear to have hostile intent.

- Female human.
- Male human, older.

They ask the guard for directions to [Hurley Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hurley-farm.md) and he kindly obliges, pointing them up the road past [Nightcrest Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/nightcrest-farm.md) to its end. The guard asks if they know Janus, prompting them to reveal that they’re searching for the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). The guard is dismissive of this and lets them on their way.

Looking up [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) spots a flicker of something across the sky. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) recognises it as a crow descending on the group. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) exclaims that Wrenn’s crow is back, while the two adventurers cross past the party. The crow descends on the guard, pecking and scratching at his face. He begins to scream.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) manages to pull the crow from the guard’s face, now with blood streaming down it. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) asks the guard if he is okay.

The two adventurers turn around suddenly. The woman runs over to the guard and drop-kicks him. The man runs over to the group and says:

> They’re after Wrenn and you’re in trouble! Don’t let them catch you. Get back to him!

They both turn and run west towards the forest.

Torbra looks for the second guard and sees him off in the distance running towards [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), about half a mile from where the party is.

The lead guard slowly stumbles back onto his feet. His face is covered in blood and is struggling to keep his eyes open from the blood, but regains his footing and draws his sword.
