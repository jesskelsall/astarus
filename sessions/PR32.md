## Arriving on the Estuary

[Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) arrives on the Humar Estuary after taking the plunge into the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) from [the Maiden's Accompaniment](../places/ships/the-maidens-accompaniment.md). They are soaked, covered in mud from the waist down, and the dreary rainy weather shows no sign of letting up.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) chastises [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) for her poor planning. Torbra retorts that she could have came up with a competing idea.

The party turns their attention to finding shelter from the elements. Looking around Torbra finds the estuary to be incredibly marshy, with a mix of land and ponds, and only a small handful of trees dotted across the horizon.

Thanea checks the contents of her bag, not yet realising that her [Meteoric Map of Astor](../papers/maps/meteoric-map-of-astor.md) has been ruined. She pours the water out from the bottom of her bag. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Produce Flame as a source of heat, pointing out to the party that she could create a fire if they can find fuel for it.

Torbra starts making her way towards the nearest tree, beginning to navigate the snaking pools of water and mud that prevent a direct route. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) goes ahead of her, constantly casting Mould Earth to create a single-file walkway through the mud and shallow water that helps speed up the party's travel.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) wonders about finding a settlement for shelter. The party doesn't believe one exists nearby, so instead they turn their attention to the trees again. Thanea suggests that where there is a tree there will be roots, hopefully meaning solid ground that they can shelter on.

It takes 30 minutes for the party to make their way to the closest tree. It is a mature medium oak tree with a thick trunk and a large enough canopy of leaves to provide partial cover from the persistent rainfall. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Plant Growth to grow more leaves on the tree, closing many of the gaps in its canopy, removing most of the large drips falling on the party below.

## Drying Off

With [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) still intent on creating a bonfire, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) suggests she chops down a tree branch while she casts Mould Earth to make the ground around the base of the tree easier to make camp on. The pair agree and get straight to it.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) suggests that the party take their clothes off to dry them near the campfire being set up. She casts Disguise Self on herself, giving the impression of a stylish and aristocratic [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md) outfit with a cravatte. One she is happy with the illusion, she removes her clothes, pulling them out of her disguised form in a seemingly peculiar manner. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) quips that she hopes the clothes dry before her disguise fades. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) pulls damp robes from her bag, changing into them. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) pulls out her mostly dry bedroll, getting into it after removing her own wet clothes.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) spends 20 minutes setting up her 2 person tent, providing a waterproof shelter for the party. They all decide to squeeze into it, sitting virtually on top of each other. Torbra cuts a branch down from the tree and forms a campfire from it despite the wet conditions. Saoirse and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) create a rack for hanging their clothes on next to the fire.

*[Short rest]*

After 2 hours, the party's clothes are no longer soaking wet, but they are still damp. Torbra's damp robes are almost dry due to the tent acting as a hotbox and her body heat warming them through.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Druidcraft to seek a weather forecast. She sees the current heavy rainfall with no further changes, not foreseeing the upcoming passing of the rain. She informs the party, prompting them to agree to move on despite the weather.

## Lost?

The party begins packing up their makeshift camp. Torbra considers where they are and where they should go next. Thanea helps her figure out their current location by pulling out her [Meteoric Map of Astor](../papers/maps/meteoric-map-of-astor.md), but realises that it is ruined - half of its ink has washed off, the rest is smudged beyond recognition. They are only able to deduce that they are south of Fort Knowe, but are unaware that they are half way down the Humar Estuary.

A sense of panic and dread briefly overtakes the party as it dawns on them that they may be lost. After a few moments they piece together their rough position on the estuary based on their view across the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) and its width, though they are clueless as to what they will find if they head in any given direction.

With little to go on but their memory, the party decides to head south west across the estuary, hoping to find the Humar Estuary Crater as they go.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) takes the lead, casting Mould Earth to help with the terrain ahead of them. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) keeps watch over the party's rear. The party travels for 2-3 hours until it begins to start getting dark. During this time the wind has subsided but the rain remains mostly persistent, giving slight signs that it may dissipate.

## A Voice and a Shack

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s ears prick up as she hears faint splashing off in the distance ahead of her. She stops, alerting the party who look and listen in turn. They begin to hear periodic splashing that sounds intentional. Not able to see anything ahead, the party decides to cautiously advance despite [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s reservations that they may be hearing a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) that came from the [Humar Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md). [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) takes the opportunity to use Disguise Self to blend her colour into the surrounding palette.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) suggests the party move carefully toward the noise in double file, allowing someone else to keep an eye out for danger. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) volunteers to go first while everyone arms themselves for a potential conflict. Their efforts to be stealthy are thwarted by the squelching of their boots, Torbra's noisy armour, and the pairs bumping into each other on [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s narrow Mould Earth path.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) uses Restore Balance to fill [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) with a warm radiant energy which heightens her concentration, allowing her to multitask effectively at creating a path and watching for danger ahead.

Through the low hanging cloud and rainfall ahead the front pair lay eyes on the [Leithran Shack](../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md) - a wooden shack part surrounded by a wooden dock, both suspended over a body of open water. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) notices an obscured figure ([Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md)) on the dock and a disturbance in the water that suggests movement within or upon it.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) shouts hello in the direction of the shack. Faintly and eerily on the wind she hears Montel shouting back:

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*

> Help! Help!

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is distrusting of the voice, cautioning the party but suggesting they speed up. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) worries that the voice is a trap, particularly out here in the middle of nowhere. They proceed toward the shack at a normal pace.

As they get closer, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) can see Montel on the dock, kneeling or leaning down, with another figure in the water - the source of the surface disturbances. The voice seeks the party again:

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> Is there someone out there? Help!

*[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md):*
> Who's there?

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> Help, come on!

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> What's wrong?

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> I'm under attack! There's crocodiles!

*[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md):*
> What's a crocodile?

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> Help!!

Torbra rushes forward, not wasting any more time and wanting to help. Everyone else follows, but [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) chooses to hang back somewhat.

As Torbra goes she tries her best to land each footfall on solid ground, but catches a foot in the mud, losing her leg below the knee to the bog, before falling forward into the deeper water beyond it. She surfaces, floating in the water 30ft from the shack. Around her two crocodiles surface, looking right at her.

## Saving Montel from Crocodiles

*[Initiative order begins]*

The crocodile attacking [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) immediately attacks him, knocking him unconscious. This is seen by the party from their positions.

The crocodiles surrounding [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) swim toward her and attack - one missing while the other scores a critical hit, restraining her in the process. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) responds by casting Ice Knife at the crocodiles, hitting them and exploding ice into Torbra who gets caught in the crossfire. The first crocodile expires, sinking into the water.

Montel makes a critical failure on his first death saving throw, placing him one failure from death immediately. His life hangs in the balance.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) tries to protect Torbra, casting Fire Bolt at the crocodile attacking her. Meanwhile [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) casts Eldritch Blast at the crocodile attacking Montel. She hits it, knocking it from the dock it is attempting to climb onto, putting some distance between it and the unconscious Montel.

Torbra regains her composure, digging deep with Second Wind and then striking at the crocodile latched onto her. She swings her halberd twice, hitting with only the first hit. She digs deeper, lashing out at it twice more while figuring out how to attack while floating in the water. She cracks the crocodile's skull with the first hit before finishing it with the second.

Four more crocodiles rise to the surface of the water, attracted by the disturbances and Torbra floating in the water. One immediately begins climbing onto the dock, trying to reach Montel. Another swims over to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and attempts to bite her but fails. Two more rush Torbra and Saoirse. The one attacking Torbra clamps its jaw around her leg.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) attempts to swipe at the crocodile with Primal Savagery but finds no purchase against its leathery skin. She steps back away from the water, avoiding another bite in the process.

Thanea steps closer to the water's edge and casts her first Fireball, aiming between four of the crocodiles, hoping to place the resulting fiery explosion in such a way that it hits the crocodiles but not the party. She is able to calculate such a spot with minimal deviation.

Thanea summons a large ball of fire with both hands, heaving it forward with a two armed pushing motion. It sails past Saoirse, radiating intense heat as it goes. It arcs downward towards the water's surface. The moment it touches it, a massive explosion of fire erupts in a large area, briefly setting the surface of the water on fire. The tree [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is stood under and the wooden boat at the dock are set ablaze. The crocodile facing Saoirse is roasted by the wash of fire, blackening and charring its hide, killing it instantly. The crocodile attacking [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) manages to dive away from the worst of the fire but is still seriously harmed.

Thanea is shocked by how effective the blast was. She was trying to give her Fire Bolt spell some more power and ended up discovering she could cast a considerably more potent spell entirely. She shouts an apology at Saoirse, worrying if she's okay. Saoirse replies that she is okay but urges Thanea to fly over to Montel to save his life before it's too late.

Saoirse blasts two crocodiles with Eldritch Blast, killing the one latched to Torbra and the one running along the dock toward Montel. Torbra makes it to the dock, climbing up and heading past the burning boat toward Montel. She sees a still person wearing rags with long straight blonde hair draped over their face.

One of the last remaining crocodiles attempts to climb onto the dock and attack Torbra but isn't able to get good purchase on the woodwork and misses. The crocodile near [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is spooked by the flaming tree above her. It instead attacks Saoirse with a critical bite.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Haste, speeding herself and her reaction times up. She swims over to Saoirse and hits the crocodile twice with her staff, doing very little damage through its thick hide and thicker skull. Thanea throws a Fire Bolt past Saoirse and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) to the crocodile attacking Torbra.

Saoirse casts Eldritch Blast on the crocodile in front of her, pushing it back without considering that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is directly behind it. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) dives to avoid it, swapping places with it. Saoirse swims for the dock. Torbra smacks the crocodile with the side of her halberd, knocking it from the dock into the water. It decides it has had enough and swims off between some trees.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and a crocodile struggle. The crocodile clamps down on her. She shouts a Healing Word at [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md), causing him to cough to consciousness. When she goes to hit the crocodile with her staff, a critical miss causes the crocodile to grab hold of her staff and pulls it from her hand, disappearing under the water's surface with it.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) swims over to the dock and climbs past Saoirse and the burning boat. Thanea finishes the last crocodile off with a Fire Bolt before swimming over to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s staff and bringing it to her.

Montel leaps to his feet and immediately darts for the door, barging it open while shouting:

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*

> My girl! My girl!

*[Initiative order ends]*
