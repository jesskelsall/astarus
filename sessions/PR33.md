### Initiative Pool

2 dice.

## Saving the Burning Boat

Following [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s fireball during the crocodile fight outside of [Leithran Shack](../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md), everyone but [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) turns their attention to the burning boat moored at the shack's dock.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) jumps onto the boat hoping to push it below the water and extinguish the flames. She slips as she goes, tumbling backwards into the boat, falling prone. The flames roar on, setting [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) ablaze.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) debate how to help [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) with their magic while [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) passes out from the fire damage. They both push the boat to try and capsize it, but the boat only rocks momentarily before it starts drifting away from the dock.

Thanea uses Divine Soul to grow her radiant wings, flying over to the boat. She casts Aid on [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), bringing her back to consciousness, still in the boat surrounded by flames. Thanea swoops down and grabs her, pulling her from the boat desperately as [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) panics. She begins to roll from the boat which Thanea assists with. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tumbles into the water.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Don't do that again!

The boat continues burning as it drifts even further from the dock.

## Entering the Shack

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) opens the door to [Leithran Shack](../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md), finding [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) consoling [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md), a four year old girl, who is sobbing after the commotion of the crocodile fight. Montel discards his shortsword and drops to his knees, water from the rain falling off him. He consoles Esme, ensuring that everything is okay while wiping a tear from her eye. She begins to cry again. As she does her hair shifts, revealing to Torbra an elven ear.

Torbra removes her robe and drapes it over Montel's shoulders. He recoils briefly, not realising she followed him into the room. He meets Torbra's gaze, allowing her to see his matching elven ears. He pleads to Torbra not to hurt them. Torbra reassures him that she has no ill intent. Not noticing her [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) badge he relaxes slightly.

Montel assures Esme that Torbra is a friend, prompting her to provide her name to the pair. She puts her halberd down, kneels and offers a hand to Esme while formally introducing herself. Esme stares inquisitively and slowly places her hand in Torbra's. Torbra fails to notice that Esme is an earth genasi. After a moment Esme grows a hollow grin out of politeness.

Montel begins to explain his situation, telling Torbra that they've been here for several days and would likely have perished if not for the party's fortuitous timing.

## Saving the Burning Boat, 2nd Attempt

Back outside, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) casts Eldritch Blast in front of the boat in the hopes of splashing water to douse the flames. Her first blast is accurate enough to achieve her goal, but her second glances the hull of the boat after entering the water.

The boat immediately tips and starts to sink. Saoirse pulls out her rope in a panic and tries to attach it to a crossbow bolt. She succeeds but realises that she won't be able to fire the bolt with the rope wrapped around it. As the realisation sets in, the boat sinks completely.

## Montel on Edge

Hearing the sound of magical blasts being fired outside and wood being shattered, [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) dives for his shortsword, grabbing it and brandishing it towards Torbra's neck.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Montel shouts at Torbra, demanding to know what's going on. Torbra panics slightly, declaring that she will go outside to check. Montel nods at her, allowing her to leave.

Torbra sees the rest of [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md). Thanea has her wings out and is floating above the water while [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is in the water. Torbra explosively demands to know what is going on. Saoirse tells her that she sank the boat. Thanea tells her that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) almost died.

*[Initiative order ends]*

Torbra chastises the party over trying to save a boat with explosions, clearly annoyed by the events. Through the door she gestures to Montel with disbelief, causing him to partially lower his guard, still somewhat distrusting of the strange visitors. Montel puts his backpack on and holsters his shortsword back into it.

Saoirse and Thanea come over to Torbra to inquire if the person who ran off is still alive. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) flies back over to the dock and lands gracefully, her radiant wings folding up as she lands. Montel's jaw drops at the sight of Thanea. He questions Torbra if Thanea is with her, Torbra giving an affirmation. Montel steps forward to examine Thanea.

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> Which god sent you?

Thanea dismisses the question by explaining that she wasn't sent by any god and is instead here to search for a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). Montel and Thanea exchange a brief formal introduction. He appears to be spaced out, examining his surroundings again and checking the rain in the palm of his hand.

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> Have I died?

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Thanea tell him that he hasn't died. He remarks on the strange day - first crocodiles and now the eclectic party meeting him. When Thanea asks why he is here, he invites everyone inside out of the rain. He heads inside to talk to Esme, priming her for incoming friendly visitors and remarking that one of them is an angel. She stares out of the door with an open mouth. Montel tells Esme that he loves her. She replies in kind - her first words since the party arrived.

The party shuffles into [Leithran Shack](../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md), completely drenched after their time in the pool. Thanea ends Radiant Soul so she can squeeze inside without the burden of her wings getting in the way.

## Getting to Know Each Other

Montel asks Torbra about their business here looking for a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). Torbra explains that the party is here on a mission to find a specific one and arrived here in challenging circumstances. Thanea asks Montel if he has seen anything strange or out of place while travelling here, aided by Saoirse using Minor Illusion to create images of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) and [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) to try and jog his memory.

Montel replies that the only strange thing he has seen is four strange military types, alluding to the party and the [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md) he sees on their clothing. The party are slow to realise that he is talking about them. As they ask for details of these people he starts describing them. Thanea asks if they are [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), revealing that Montel doesn't know about the organisation.

He questions their badge and if it means they are in the military. Thanea says no (not correct), explaining that they don't like the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). Saoirse does a better job of explaining that while they are part of the military, their goals aren't that of the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). Montel cuts her off mid-explanation, tiredly asking for them to be upfront if they are here to "take them back". He takes some convincing to realise that the party has no interest in apprehending elves, taking a few sighs of relief, looking like he dodged a bullet.

Torbra asks who and where they are trying to avoid. Montel parts his hair on the sides to reveal his elven ears, making a silent point. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) mirrors his actions, revealing his cow-like firbolg ears, causing Esme to smile at her. Montel tells the party that they want to leave the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) and that it was a mistake to come here. It is clear that he has no idea where he is going and is only here to avoid the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md). When Torbra asks where they aim to go, Montel says the [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md) of [Kardanis](../places/regions/kardanis.md), away from people like her, pointing at her badge.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) empathises, giving a deadpan summary of their troubles with the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). Montel remarks that at least they had a choice, causing him to well up and fight back tears from his experiences with [Vensys Leithran](../characters/vensys-leithran.md)'s death. Torbra offers them both help. Montel is reluctant as he originally wished to make this journey alone. He asks Torbra if the party would be willing to keep them safe and away from the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

Saoirse replies that they have kicked some [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) ass before and wouldn't mind doing it again. This brings out a smirk in Montel who begins to warm to them, declaring them good folk and worthy of their trust for now. He invites Esme to agree but she goes shy with five sets of eyes on her. Everyone fails to notice the skin tone similarities between Torbra and Esme.

Montel asks what the plan is. Thanea explains that they need to complete their mission first. Montel once again explains that he knows nothing of the things they seek, not having seen anything since the pair left [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). Torbra recognises the town name from [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md)' [Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md), having noticed it as a potential through-town for the choice of [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) missions she passed up. Torbra relays the location of [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) to the party.

When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks for a forked twig (divining rod) to aid in looking for the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), Saoirse notes the night hour and suggests the party sleep for the night before continuing their search.

## Amusing Esme

Torbra, Thanea, and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) take their wet clothes off and change into robes and town clothes. It is clear that Montel and Esme are not bothered by this, suggesting their familiarity with intimate (poor) living conditions.

Prior to taking her wet clothes off, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) casts Disguise Self to create a "unicorn onesie" - something resembling a theatre production's approximation of a unicorn, or at least how she thinks one might look. Her vision does not translate correctly. Instead she turns into a jester that physiologically has a unicorns head with articulated lips for speaking. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) loves it, Torbra finds it an improvement, Thanea facepalms. Montel is in stupendous disbelief while Esme begins laughing, declaring Saoirse a horse. Saoirse augments her disguise with an array of flowers.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) uses Wild Shape to turn into a horse, significantly increasing the amount of space she takes up. Thanea falls backwards as she is hit by [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). Montel gets increasingly confused, shouting "why!?" repeatedly while Esme bursts into giggles.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) ups the ante, using Giant's Might to grow to the height of the room, knocking Thanea (who just got back up) and Montel aside. She looks down at Esme who goes silent while meeting her gaze. After a few moments she goes wide eyed and gasps.

*[Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md):*
> Whoah! You're so cool!

She looks at [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and declares:

*[Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md):*
> I want to be like Torbra!

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks what about her, prompting Torbra to make Esme choose between them. The whole party is enjoying the ridiculousness of the moment, swept up in the infectious childish wonder of Esme. She thinks for a moment before asking Torbra if she can ride [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> Let's find out!

Torbra attempts to mount [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) but bangs her head on the roof before clumsily half falling over.

Montel, chuckling along nervously, declares that enough fun has been had. She asks if [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Torbra are able to change back. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) answers by doing so while Torbra's size wears off within the minute, her not able to end it willingly. Even this amuses Esme who finds the pair's abilities awesome to behold.

## Plans for Tomorrow

As the fun dies down, Montel ashamedly asks if they have any food as they don't have much. Torbra provides them with two rations from her bag. He is thankful they are prepared for wilderness exploration. Everyone spends the next hour sitting and eating for the day. Montel provides lighting in the dark conditions using a candle and tinderbox.

Over food Montel speaks to Torbra about their plans tomorrow. He says that the pair can stay here while the party attends to their business - they will stay put until the party's return. Torbra admits that they don't have the best grasp on where they are. Montel instead suggests coming with them. Torbra is fine with the idea providing they hang back and keep out of harm's way.

Montel realises that Torbra thinks he was offering combat help and awkwardly dismisses the notion, admitting that while he owns a shortsword he is no fighter and would prefer to avoid combat whenever possible. He seeks Esme's agreement that the pair are good at avoiding danger and receives it with a nod.

Thanea asks the party if they have a plan for how to find the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) tomorrow. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) hints at having a method for finding it but doesn't divulge the details.

The party unfurl their bedrolls and bed down for the night. Torbra takes first watch outside the shack in the drizzling rain. Her senses are muted due to the sound of the rain, which begins to abate as her watch ends.

## Esme's Murmurs

When Torbra returns to the shack at the end of her watch she hears a faint voice from inside. She recognises it as Esme's voice - murmurs as she sleeps, repeating the same words periodically.

*[Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md):*
> Practice. Apply. Grow.

Torbra doesn't realise the full significance of the words she heard when retrieving her Rune Knight powers from the standing stones on the bank of the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md). It keeps her up all night, a half memory of its significance taunting her as she lies in bed.

Thanea takes second watch, observing other crocodiles in the deep water. Fortunately they pay her no mind and don't present a pressing danger. As the sky lightens and the sun begins to rise, clear skies drift in from the east, treating her to a dramatic orange sunrise. She reflects on the relative freedom of their mission and the peacefulness of being alone in the wilderness once again.

## Saoirse Deva Dream 3

During the night [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) dreams of an alternate version of events in [The Dog's Groke](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md), during [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s battle with the [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md), formally [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md).

Her dream takes place through the eyes of [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md). She watches the events of the fight unfold, including the initial struggles, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) passing out, and Torbra pulling the creature into the hall before getting blasted into the opposite room.

The dream progresses to the point where Thanea is on the floor of Slaine's room unconscious. Saoirse sees through her eyes, observing the battle developing around her. Suddenly she witnesses a radiant figure with glowing eyes and wings enter the room. They rush over to her, leaning down and looking into her eyes before offering a hand. Saoirse realises that she is looking at a version of herself where she has the same [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) powers as Thanea.

Saoirse willingly takes her own hand, allowing her to move her body and focusing her vision. The hand raises her to her feet before she realises what is happening. Radiant Saoirse gives a grin before pulling out her daggers. A radiant glow forms on the surface of the metal as she readies them, before she charges out of the room toward the creature, a clash of puncture wounds heard from through the door.

Saoirse's vision fades to white as the dream ends. She wakes up in the morning feeling ambivalent: warm and nurtured, but also hollow and incomplete.

*[Short rest: [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md)]*  
*[Long rest: [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md), [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)]*

## Morning Revelations

The party, Montel, and Esme begin packing up their gear in the early morning. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) uses Druidcraft to check the day's weather, seeing a thick blanket of clouds giving way to a warm sun. Esme claps gently, impressed by the feat, catching [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) unaware. She asks how [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) can do that. When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tries to explain, Esme can't really process her interpretation of "druidic magic", creating a circular loop of childish questioning.

Montel goes outside and finds Thanea, informing her of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s weather findings. He makes small talk with Thanea about the weather while staring off across the Humar Estuary under the early morning sun. He speaks to himself and to [Vensys Leithran](../characters/vensys-leithran.md):

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> You would have liked this.

He clocks a look at Thanea who smiles back at him, silently placing a hand on his shoulder in acknowledgement. Montel goes back inside to retrieve Esme so she can see the picturesque morning. She totters outside. Montel warns her of the edge of the dock, ever vigilant of her safety.

Torbra decides to try and lift Esme onto her shoulders. As she goes to grab her she notices an unmistakable colouration of her skin - her own. She places her arm next to hers, comparing them directly. While their skin tones aren't identical, Torbra has a clear gut feeling that they are one in the same.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> Look, we're the same.

Esme also makes the comparison, looking up at Torbra and smiling.

Montel catches a glimpse of the pair and comes over, seeing their arms and making the same realisation. Tears begin streaming down his face. He inquires with an air of shock and muted bewilderment.

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> Wait what? You're... like her?

Torbra explains that she's never met another person like herself. Montel does his best not to burst into tears, his eyes reddening. He asks where Torbra is from. She explains that she grew up in Iredale but was found in the woods as a child, an orphan. Montel makes it clear he doesn't know the place.

When Torbra explains that the town isn't hard to get to, Montel asks if there are others like her there, already forgetting her previous statement due to shock. He then asks if she has met an elf like him before or if there are any there, to which Torbra confirms that he is the first she has met.

It becomes clear that Montel is considering whether Iredale is somewhere they could could be safe. Torbra tells him that she knows the captain of Iredale and as such could write some sort of letter of recommendation to him on their behalf. He laments not knowing much about [Kardanis](../places/regions/kardanis.md) and his understanding that the [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md) is built for much shorter dwarves. Torbra reassures him that Iredale is more diverse and welcoming than that. Montel once again points out that the place's diversity ends at elves.

Montel explains that there were other elves in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), perceiving a safety in numbers that turned out not to be true. He trails off as painful memories flood back.

## Esme's Past

[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) offers a history of [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) to [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md), assuming she would want to know about her lineage in light of their similarity. She is incredibly receptive to learning more in the hopes it will help her with her own search for answers.

Montel mentions his wife [Vensys Leithran](../characters/vensys-leithran.md) and their life in the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). Due to a family feud they had to leave, so they emigrated to the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) via the Kas'ran Desert, Mossband, [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) and then [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), where they eventually settled. They passed up [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) due to the heavy presence of [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) coming and going, presenting a risk to their safety.

Vensys fell pregnant as they arrived in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), where Esme was born. They lived there for four years until "then it was only the two of us" (Vensys was killed by a local gang with a hate of immigrants and elves in particular), prompting Montel and Esme to hit the road and attempt to move their lives anywhere else, though they don't know where.

Montel tells Torbra that Vensys was more like himself than Torbra - an elf. When Torbra points out that he is suggesting Esme was born of two elven parents, Montel reminds her of the elven ears she possesses, proving she is an elf like them. Torbra points to her own human rounded ears, drawing similarity again between herself and Esme regardless of their ears.

Montel tells Torbra of the word used in the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) for such people - genasi. She asks what it is exactly. Montel does his best to describe a rare gift that few possess, valued by the republic and celebrated, rumoured to be a blessing from the [gods](../gods/gods.md) themselves. He mentions red skinned genasi that can breathe fire and blue skinned genasi that can breathe underwater, but recalls no other instance of grey skinned genasi that he has came across.

He expresses his gratitude for now knowing another, but laments the trouble with being even more different than the average elf in a kingdom that has a poor reputation towards them. Torbra sympathises, wishing only for Esme to grow up away from such sentiment and have a true childhood. 

The notion makes Montel well up with tears again as he agrees. When Torbra puts her hand on his shoulder in awkward sympathy, he leans in for an embracing hug, crying uncontrollably into Torbra's shoulder, the flood gates of emotion opening. After a few moments of shock Torbra hugs him back.

After a few moments, Esme pulls on Montel's trousers.

*[Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md):*
> Are you okay daddy?

He pulls away from Torbra and kneels to her, responding through his tears.

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> I am. In fact I think I'm better than fine. These are tears of joy. These people are here to help us. They really are.

Montel turns back to Torbra, changing the subject.

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> So, we're following you, right?
