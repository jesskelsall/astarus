## The Day of the Final

*[Long rest]*

[Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) wake up the following day, on the morning of Bhydag, 1st of Shavdor - the third and final day of [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md), and the day of the [Nature's Battle 27](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-27.md) final match. They have the whole day to themselves, or they can be returned to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) early if they wish.

The party make their way downstairs from their sleeping area in the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) Stronghold, entering a communal space styled similarly to the ground floor of [The Mission's End](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-missions-end.md). [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) are sat at a table, having just learned that [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) has already left the stronghold, presumably on her own business.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) emerges down the stairs, catching the eye of Ahsha and Ephaine. He is looking noticeably more effeminate, wearing a long flowing gown, heels, and wearing makeup including black lipstick. He is also notably more outwardly positive. When Ahsha and Ephaine pick up on his changes, Noon explains that his father expected a certain type of attire for the tournament.

The party debates what to do with their day. They are keen to explore the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival, though they are aware that they are likely to have achieved a "minor celebrity" status with their participation in [Nature's Battle 27](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-27.md).

## A Letter for Noon

As the party is about to get up and leave, an [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) comes over to speak to Noon. They confirm his identity before providing him with a letter ([Schiller Weapon Offer](../papers/letters/schiller-weapon-offer.md)) that they explain arrived for them this morning. Noon takes it and thanks them. On the back of the envelope is the [Schiller family](../organisations/schiller-family.md) crest pressed into black wax.

He opens the letter and reads it silently. As he goes the good demeanour on his face drops, catching Ahsha's attention. As he reaches the end of the letter his mood improves. Engrossed in the letter, he only responds to Ahsha once he has finished reading. Noon informs the party that despite his facial expressions, the letter is good news. He mentions that he and his father ([Bernard Horace Schiller](../characters/bernard-horace-schiller.md)) don't often see eye to eye.

At the table opposite [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears, sat on a chair and leaning back. Only Noon sees her.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*

> Aww, I think he's the one that's soft! I was beginning to think that father didn't love you. I don't think you need his charity, do you brother light? Though I'm not too sure about your new friends...

A wry smile crosses Noon's face before he gives a subtle knowing nod towards [Nills](../characters/nills.md), who in response chuckles, swirls a hand around their wrist, and disappears, the smoke that comprises their form dissipating up to the ceiling before fading away.

Noon ponders for a moment before addressing Ahsha and Ephaine, declaring that he has a proposition for them - he may be able to acquire some new weaponry ([Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md)). He points out his family's affinity for weapon making. This doesn't mean much to Ephaine, but Ahsha with her pit fighting background is very familiar with their weapons, having seen one before up close and understanding their rarity and in-demand nature. She realises that she's in the presence of someone special, then begins gushing about the [Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) example she once saw. Noon tells Ephaine that his family owns a weapon manufacturing business and are quite industrious sorts.

Noon explains the proposition: he can get access to [Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) weapons at a sizeable discount. He asks what they would both be interested in:

| Character | Weapon preference |
| --- | --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | Greataxe or Greatsword |
| [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | Dagger |

Noon is candid with the party, reading out the prices on the confidential letter to both Ahsha and Ephaine. They both immediately deflate at the sound of the eye-watering prices. Ahsha is surprised that the price is *with* a discount.

Ahsha suggests that the party could spend the day doing odd-jobs for people in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) in the search for extra coin. Ephaine wonders about whether [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) are allowed to take on work outside of their duties. Ahsha assures her that while it is not expressly permitted, there is no rule against it. They endeavour to find some work today.

The party once again discuss their plans for the day. Ahsha is keen to see a [Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) weapon this morning if possible. Ephaine asks about seeing the tournament final, but Ahsha would rather take an odd-job if possible. They agree to try and see the final if time permits.

Noon cryptically alludes to being able to acquire a [Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) weapon for free without saying as much.

## [Schiller Steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) Shopping

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) tells the party about [Schiller Steel Eskrigg](../places/buildings/shops/schiller-steel-eskrigg.md) before trying to find the shop. It takes the about an hour to find it, especially as Ahsha (who has local knowledge) deferred to Noon who didn't actually know how to find the shop.

They finally find it inside of an upmarket building. On arrival, Ephaine wonders if they're about to meet Noon's father. He is dismissive, explaining that his father never leaves [Kardanis](../places/regions/kardanis.md).

Inside they meet [Callum Briar](../characters/callum-briar.md), who first sees Ahsha and Ephaine, judging them immediately and telling them that the store is closed. As Noon enters last and closes the door, Callum's demeanour switches to one of abject horror, profusely apologising for insulting Noon. It is clear that Callum knows who Noon is by appearance alone.

Noon enjoys how uncomfortable Callum is. He approaches Noon, shaking his hand with both of his while introducing himself. When Callum asks what the party needs, Noon asks for 3 daggers and a greataxe. In response he locks the door and fetches a greataxe from under the counter. Noon motions for Ahsha to pick it up, Callum deferring to Noon's judgement. Ahsha is surprised at how light and well balanced the weapon feels. Callum informs Noon that the shop only has one dagger currently in stock.

Callum confirms that Noon is aware of the family prices before providing the cost of the full order: 2,640 gp. Noon tells Callum that they'd only like the greataxe and tries to get Callum to put it "on my father's tab", but Callum refuses, worried that he would lose his life if he gave a [Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) weapon away, even to a family member.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears behind the counter, seemingly leaning on Callum's shoulder. After a brief quip he vanishes again:

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*

> Well, it's a shame, but the pen is mightier than the sword!

Ahsha relinquishes the greataxe, placing it back on the counter. Callum puts it back under the counter hurriedly, worried that the party might just decide to take it and run. It is clear to Ephaine that Callum is treating Ahsha and herself with extreme suspicion. The party begins to leave, but Noon approaches the counter to talk to Callum more privately.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*

> I would advise you, if you want to keep your job, that you'll keep that axe to one side.

This intimidates Callum enough that he wets his pants. He profusely agrees before noticing that he's wet himself. Noon shoots him a predatory grin before leaving.

Ahsha and Ephaine question why Callum was so intimidated by Noon. He explains it away as quirky family politics. When Ahsha questions why he would fear for his life, Noon brushes her off, telling her that he is not at liberty to discuss the family's business practices.

## Looking for Work

The party discuss what to do now. Ahsha suggests they try and find work, wondering if her old mentor ([Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md)) is knocking about and may have something they can do. She leads the party to the pit fighting building he was usually found at.

On arrival it becomes apparent that the building is abandoned and boarded up. Ahsha looks inside to see what could have happened, seeing a cluttered mess. Wanting to delve further, she takes Ephaine's crowbar and begins prying the board from the front door. As she struggles to remove the soggy and rotting boards, she hears a familiar voice from behind:

*[Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md):*

> Oi! You son of a bitch!

Ahsha spins around and picks his heavy dwarven body up, spinning him around before letting him down. She asks him what happened to the old place, to which he responds that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) closed it down as they are trying to regulate pit fighting and turn it into a more publicly visible industry. Ahsha introduces Ephaine and Noon before asking if Barthon has any work for them that would pay.

He ushers them into the building across the street - his house. It is well kept despite the lower class neighbourhood, with a focus on the fireplace. He explains that he and some of his acquaintances are trying to take the pit fighting scene underground. They have found a closed off section of the city sewers that should be relatively dry and could be used as an underground pit fighting ring. He offers 40 gp if they can clear out the rats in their way, possibly more if they can finish the job today as it will afford them an opportunity to move equipment into the sewers under the cover of the festival.

Barthon puts an emphasis on the dangerous nature of the rats, relating to Ahsha that Luke (a mutual pit fighting acquaintance) lost his last good hand to a rat bite, and is now re-training to be a kick boxer.

The party agrees to take on the mission. Barthon leads them to the sewer grate closest to the section he wants clearing. Ephaine casts Pass Without Trace on the party before they head out, making it trivially easy to move stealthily.

Barthon leads them to a courtyard with a statue of [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) on a pillar at its center. Here he opens a door to the ground floor of a multi-storey building, revealing the interior of this floor to only be a concrete shell. Inside he locates the drain cover and lifts it with his crowbar.

He provides the party with instructions on where to go: right at the first junction, then left at the larger opening's junction. The party proceeds down the ladder, Ahsha heading in first. Noon tries his best to keep his dress out of the sewer water, not doing very well.

## Into the Sewers

Noon casts Dancing Lights, providing floating lights which hover above each party member. Ahsha takes point with Ephaine at the rear.

The party follows the sewer tunnel for 50 ft before coming across an angled junction. As instructed they take the obtuse angle to the right. After 10 ft more they come across a much larger perpendicular tunnel. There is a 5 ft drop into this area, the current tunnel appearing to continue on the opposite side. Water is flowing from the current tunnel into the wider section which is relatively dry.

Ahsha steps down into the wider section of tunnel, confident that they need to proceed left. Ephaine, still at the rear, hears the sound of faint splashing coming from the pipe behind them, as well as squeaking from rats in the wider section. The group readies themselves, Noon casting Mage Armour in preparation.

The sound of rushing water approaches them from behind, eventually revealing itself to be a current of water that spills into the wider section, threatening to knock everyone over, but they all hold their ground. Ephaine sees a humanoid hand floating in the liquid as the bloated body of [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md) floats into the chamber.

Ahsha flips the body over to investigate. She finds them bloated, wearing destitute rags. Suddenly their face begins to bulge as a rat bites its way out of an eye socket, several more rats emerging from the same place.

## Sewer Rats

*[Initiative order begins]*

As the party jumps into action, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) casts Faerie Fire, on the swarm of rats, illuminating considerably more rats in the water than the party was aware of. Another surge of water begins to bring more rats into the wider section, swarming the party intently.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) begins to hack away at the rats in front of her while [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) casts Arms of Hadar to lash out at the swarming rats.

It doesn't take long for the rats to start crawling all over the party. Ephaine tries to run away down the tunnel to combat them, but they pursue her with vigour. Noon soon falls unconscious into the water as the rats become too much to bear.

Ephaine casts Moonbeam on herself, burning some of the rats covering her. This proves effective but she's not able to stand in it for long.

Ahsha seeing Noon go down opts to try and run from the rats swarming over him, getting hit in the process. The situation at this point becomes desperate. She hacks away at the rats surrounding Noon, landing crucial blows at the most opportune time, killing most of them outright.

Ephaine casts Moonbeam again, this time on Ahsha. This burns away most of the remaining rats.

With the rats defeated, Ahsha makes sure that Noon isn't face down in the water, before Ephaine casts Healing Word on him, bringing him to consciousness. Noon proceeds to throw up, wordlessly disgusted by the sewer he is now submersed in.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## A Mysterious Corpse

Ephaine decides to take another look at the corpse of [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md). Rooting through the pockets she finds 6 gp 8 sp before also retrieving the military badge of an [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md). This revelation worries the party. Ephaine recognises the gold bar as denoting an officer rank, though she isn't sure exactly which [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) rank it maps onto.

Ephaine looks further at the corpse, trying to determine a cause of death. She finds no weapon wounds, with any other details lost to several days of water damage. She also notices the slightly pointed ears of a half-elf.

Showing the badge to the party, Ephaine asks Ahsha if this means trouble. Ahsha suggests they talk to Barthon about this, but Ephaine doesn't trust him as she doesn't know him. She becomes increasingly worried that they have inadvertently fallen into trouble, particularly as they don't have official business down in the sewers. Ahsha suggests leaving the corpse and thinking nothing more of it, but Ephaine insists on a proper burial. The group are worried and unable to agree on a course of action.

Ephaine pulls out her bed roll, placing it on a part of the wider tunnel section that is dry before using it to wrap up the corpse, binding it all together with some rope.

Ahsha and Ephaine agree to head back up to the surface with the body. Ephaine wants to report their death, as their family deserve to know what happened to them. Ahsha worries that carrying a random corpse through the streets of a city looks too suspicious. They tentatively agree to figure this out once up the ladder.

The party make their way back up into the ground floor of the building they got into the sewers from. The room is empty, but Noon notices a figure hovering on the other side of the doorway they entered in from. After informing the group, the feeling is that it's Barthon. Ahsha opens the door and their suspicions are confirmed. She ushers him into the building.

## Barthon's Betrayal

When [Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md) wants to know how their mission in the sewers went, Ahsha bluntly asks him why "there is a dead [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in the sewer", before showing him to the body. Ephaine explains that they were attacked savagely by a lot of sewer rats and weren't able to even reach the area that he wanted them to clear out, but that the corpse they found is now more pressing.

As Barthon looks at the corpse of [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md), he glumly pleads with Ahsha not to do this to him, and instead walk away and forget what they've seen here - he'd even make it worth their while. Ephaine brings up wanting to make sure this person's family knows what happened. Barthon, now distant, declares that the person doesn't have a family and isn't an [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md). Ephaine asks if they were impersonating one, but Barthon doesn't answer, instead staring at his feet.

Ahsha appeals to Barthon's sense of fatherhood to Ahsha, asking what sort of trouble he's in.

*[Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md):*

> He's a spy.

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*

> For who?

*[Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md):*

> For the Syntenne of course.

The gravity of the situation washes over the party. Ahsha and Ephaine make sure that Barthon knows how serious his collusion is - Ephaine points out he could be executed for this. Barthon is well aware of this, sounding unfazed as the pair lay into him.

Barthon is in disbelief that the pair think he would do this willingly, knowing it is not worth the risk. Once again he hesitates, urging the party to walk away, trying to protect them from the truth. Ephaine and Noon try to get him to divulge further details.

Barthon gives in. He explains that he was coerced. One of the spies ([Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md)) infiltrated the pits by wearing a hat, which he admits sounds silly, but he is not in the business of asking questions. Once they were in, he was implicated. It became clear that the spy knew where his family lived, giving them leverage over him.

He names the spy that has been working with him closest - [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), though he is unsure if she is their ringleader. She threatened to tip the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) off to him working with spies if he didn't comply. Barthon also identifies the corpse by name as Castien ([Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md)).

He makes it clear that all they have wanted from him is somewhere to stay and a bit of local knowledge - he finds them surprisingly unknowing of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)'s culture.

Ephaine asks why Barthon had them clearing out the sewers. He reveals that it was for the spies. Ephaine is furious at the revelation - Barthon had them aiding spies without their knowledge. Noon walks off to mull over the implication.

Barthon stutters through an apology, making it clear that he has a daughter and he worries for her. He has sent his family away to [Mockerkin](../places/towns/mockerkin.md) for their safety. Noon finds this understandable as they had leverage on him. Barthon then suggests rolling the body into the sewer and skipping town with the party, drawing a line under the whole thing. Ahsha echoes Ephaine's sentiments that the body was a person that likely has a family that deserve to know about him.

Ahsha worries that the death of Castien will have dire repercussions on Barthon. He gets panicked, asking how he died, but the party doesn't know. He assures Ahsha that it wasn't by his hand, raising his voice and urging Ahsha to believe him. While she does, both Ahsha and Ephaine continue to be furious at how he has now endangered their lives too.

Ephaine asks Barthon to leave them alone for a while so they can discuss their next steps. Barthon makes sure they know that if he doesn't report Castien's death to Allisa, it will come back to haunt him.

## Next Steps

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) suggests that they do what their training tells them to do - report this to their superior, [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md), who happens to be in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) for the tournament.

It occurs to [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) that the tournament final is in 5 hours, and that the spies could be plotting to attack [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) while it is packed with spectators. The notion hits [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and Ephaine equally hard. Suddenly they feel the pinch of time.

Ahsha wonders if they could investigate the sewers around and under [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) for any signs of sabotage or plotting. Ephaine wonders if it would be best to report this and leave it to the experts - the situation feels like a matter out of their depth. Noon is concerned that that would take time that the party doesn't have.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears again, leaning up against a wall with one foot against it, arms crossed. Once again she doesn't stay long:

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*

> Well this is quite the pickle, isn't it! I think you've got enough time...

Ephaine once again implores telling "the powers that be" about this, rather than Ahsha's suggestions on handling the matter themselves. Ahsha wonders where [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) is in all of this.

A tentative agreement is reached that the group need to find and inform [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) before they do anything else. When Noon suggests that one of them could find Bryce while the rest begin acting, Ephaine makes it clear that she is willing to take the fall if need be, and that she is having a very hard time with the whole situation.

Ephaine and Ahsha ask Barthon how Allisa gets in contact with him. He is blunt in telling them that she simply shows up at his house, which Ephaine finds direct. Once again he is asked what the spies are interested in, to which he again replies that they are interested in culture and "what makes us tick". Unsurprisingly they are interested in information about the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), but he puts a fine point on explaining that while their geographical knowledge is sound, their knowledge of the culture and religion of the kingdom is woefully lacking, much to his surprise.

After discussing what evidence they should bring to Bryce, Ahsha and Noon suggest bringing the military badge. Ephaine goes one step further and cuts off a half-elf ear from [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md)'s corpse before wrapping it in a napkin.

Barthon asks what he should do now, suggesting that if the party is going to the authorities, maybe he should hand himself in now. Ephaine tells him that maybe he should go and be with his family now. Ahsha echoes the sentiment, telling him to forget they ever crossed paths, which he agrees to. Ahsha asks if he has enough money, but Ephaine recalls that he offered a 40 gp reward for their work.

Barthon removes his coin pouch and gives it straight to Ahsha (containing 84 gp 4 sp 86 cp). Ephaine is quick to make it clear that this isn't buying anything from them, which he understands. [Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md) leaves hurriedly.

The party finds a spot on this floor to hide the body for the time being before heading back out onto the streets of [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md).
