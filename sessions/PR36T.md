## Teleported Somewhere Unfamiliar

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) appears inside of [Supreme Hall](../places/buildings/supreme-hall.md) near the doors after having teleported by using the letter ([PR36-L-3](../letters/PR36-L-3.md)) she possesses. A brief smell of ozone indicates that magic was just at work. As she arrives it crumbles into ashes in her hands, falling between them.

Startled, she drinks in her surroundings, noticing [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md) sat on his throne. Next to him stands [Patricia Wilbenotel](../characters/patricia-wilbenotel.md) who is engaging in quiet conversation with him. Noticing Thanea's arrival, the pair stop talking and stare towards her. Thanea recognises their armour as [Astornar](../organisations/government/astornar.md) and Patricia as one of the generals that judged the [Astornar](../organisations/government/astornar.md) trial for [the firbolg controversy](../storylines/ended/the-firbolg-controversy.md).

Thanea begins to panic, muttering to herself:

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Great, you've really fucked up this time.

She apologises to the nearby guards while trying to sink into the ground, feeling very seen and unable to do anything about it. Patricia begins to walk along the room towards her, the journey across the room echoing around her, making Thanea even more nervous.

Patricia tells Thanea she is either late or early, prompting her to apologise again. Patricia stops in front of her, taking a hard look over her. She declares it a pleasure to meet her again, Thanea doing the same, formally introducing herself. Patricia does the same, calling herself the General of War. Her face is one of resting sternness.

Corville clears his throat intentionally, prompting Patricia to leave. She wishes Thanea good luck. As she goes, the two guards push the doors open for her, letting her in to a similarly designed antechamber. The guards close the doors behind her, an audible clunk echoing around the room. This scares Thanea even more.

Thanea tentatively starts walking towards [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md), trying to judge if this is what she is supposed to do. No word or signal comes from Corville, so she presses on, slowly making her way forward. The length of the room makes the journey feel endless.

## Meeting the General Supreme

As Thanea approaches the base of the steps, Corville stands before raising a hand in gesture for her to go no further. Thanea complies immediately. Not sure of the etiquette of someone of his rank she bows forward with her upper body, profusely apologising for the time she arrived, babbling. Corville matches her bow but only with his head, keeping his eyes on her.

Corville tells her it is okay, causing her to stop babbling. He asks her if she knows who he is, to which she replies correctly, noting that she can at least read his name on the letter.

Corville descends the steps slowly, stopping at the first step. He starts by congratulating [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) on their efforts in [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md), saying that they fought valiantly. Thanea thanks him, saying they gave it their all but regretted not being able to win, and they'd like to do better next time. Knowing that the option won't be available again, Corville stifles a wry grin.

He asks Thanea why he has summoned her here. Thanea expects that it is because she grew wings and flew above the arena, earning a confirming nod. Thanea readily tells him that it was a first for her and due to her feeling in danger, before offering to tell him anything he wants to know.

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> I think it goes without saying that we've not seen someone who possesses your abilities. That's why you're here.

Thanea explains that she has no idea how rare this is or if others exist, despite her efforts at researching in [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md) and asking other people. She also mentions her "weird dreams" and suggests they may be related. Corville tells her that the libraries will only tell her so much. Thanea figured as much but has no idea how to learn more.

Thanea recants her [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) deva dream wherein she took flight on radiant wings, a feeling that would later become familiar to her. When Corville asks if her dream has "come to pass", Thanea explains that she has had other dreams before that have come true, though the dream specifics and the final play of events don't match exactly. She believes that her [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) dream represented her time in [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md), particularly her first use of Radiant Soul. She alludes to [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) being present in many of her dreams, and it was her who gave her the power to manifest her wings.

She then talks of her first deva dream of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) and its influence on her choice to leave her forest home to pursue it. Corville makes Thanea aware that he knows of the meteoric work that the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) are currently doing. When Corville asks her if the [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) are related to her powers she tells him that she isn't sure, concealing her feelings that there may be a connection. Corville hopes that they are not linked.

## Demonstrating Her Wings

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> Anyway, talk is cheap. A demonstration, perhaps?

Thanea reluctantly agrees but does as she is told, closing her eyes while using Radiant Soul to conjure her radiant wings. When she opens her eyes they are glowing white-yellow, the entire eye consumed by it. She spreads her wings to put on a full show.

Corville's face does not change, giving Thanea no sense of his thoughts.

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> Impressive, and the stories do not do it justice.

He twirls his finger to instruct Thanea to spin. She does so, narrowly missing his face with her wings, not bearing their size in mind while moving. He then raises his upturned open palm, causing Thanea to demonstrate her ability to fly. She lifts off the ground with a few flaps of her wings, hanging in the air with skill.

Corville continues to express how impressed he is, noting that for someone who only took flight for the first time recently, she has mastered the skill quickly. Thanea tells him that it comes very natural to her, it taking no effort on her part to start in dangerous situations, an ability of instinct rather than control. Corville hopes that they keep her safe.

## Being Interrogated

As Thanea continues to talk, Corville cuts in without tact, asking Thanea where she was born. She tells him that she doesn't know but tells him she was found in the forest as a child and raised an orphan in Bootle. She starts to shy away from the specifics of her upbringing so as not to touch on her troubled past.

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> That's okay, we know a few things about you. We know about the barn you burned down and the fate your parents met.

Thanea freezes in shock, a look that Corville does not miss.

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> You must understand, you're a person of interest now.

Thanea nods, not quite understanding his meaning. Corville squints, his line of questioning growing more serious by the second.

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> So, [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) from Bootle, what do you know of [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)?

Thanea doesn't recognise the name and says as much.

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md)? The Veritacris?

Thanea shakes her head, her bewilderment clear. She apologies for never having heard these names. Corville simply says "good" before he steps down from the first step, getting uncomfortably close to Thanea. She stands her ground out of fear. Corville pauses dramatically.

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> So you have no dealings with the Republic?

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> No, I've never been there. I've lived my whole life on the road and in the forest, just visiting towns. I'd never been to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) before and have never left the kingdom.

Corville smirks before shaking his head slightly.

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> You barely know what you're talking about.  
> Okay! I believe you.

Corville turns around immediately and begins climbing the steps back to his throne. Thanea apologises again, not sure what's happening here.

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> Well, we don't either to be honest.

## The Nature of Radiant Soul

[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md) interrupts himself, realising he forgot to bring up a topic. He is unsure if the revelation has reached her yet, and so invites her to cast a spell. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) tries to cast Minor Illusion but no illusion appears in the palm of her hand. Thanea is surprised, saying that she thought her wings were magic. Corville tells her that they are currently in an anti-magic field, so her power must be different somehow. Thanea notes the use of her wings in this place didn't feel different.

Thanea suggests that she could try using her healing magic which she believes is related to her wings. Corville agrees, descending the steps again to meet her. He pulls down the bracer on one of his arms, revealing the inside of his forearm near the wrist. He then uses telekinesis to move a dagger from his pocket to his wrist, Thanea watching as it floats through the air. As it meets his wrist it makes a small incision before floating off to the side and hanging in place. Thanea flinches.

After a moment of hesitation she touches her hand to Corville's lightly bloody wrist, pressing onto the wound gently. She uses Healing Hands, radiant light emerging from under her hand. When she removes it the wound is gone. This confirms Thanea's suspicions that her wings and healing ability are connected. Corville's dagger floats back into his pocket.

## Parting Ways

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> What you have is undoubtedly unique. Your abilities will be most useful.

Thanea instinctively thanks him for the compliment, not knowing what else to do, still nervous in the situation she finds herself in. Corville ascends the steps as he begins to talk, stopping to stand at the top, looking back down at Thanea.

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> Well, I wish you well in your meteoric studies. Please stay out of trouble. And it would be a shame for you to die.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Yeah, I think so too. Thank you.

Corville ends the anti-magic field around them, Thanea picking up on a slight smell of ozone and shift in the air.

*[Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md):*
> Goodbye, [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md).

Corville raises his hand, palm open, a blinding blue flash of light emanating from it. As it subsides, Thanea finds herself back in the place she was in before responding to the letter ([PR36-L-3](../letters/PR36-L-3.md)).

Thanea curses to herself, calling herself an idiot, still beating herself up from appearing in [Supreme Hall](../places/buildings/supreme-hall.md) at the wrong time.
