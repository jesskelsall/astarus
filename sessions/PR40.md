### [Inspiration Pool](../mechanics/dm-inspiration.md)

2 dice.

## Rain Sets In

The party continues riding west along the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) on a miserable grey morning, having just recently crossed the [River Carn](../places/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md).

Around midday it begins to drizzle, the clouds overhead thickening and darkening the day. The party is open to the elements on the back of their cart, but press on. After an hour of drizzle it begins to rain properly. [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) asks [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) if she can cast Tiny Hut over the cart, but [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) informs her that it is static and can't be placed over something else.

The two horses under control of [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) become belligerent due to the rain, but Torbra is able to keep them under control, albeit at a slower speed. The rain grows heavier as a strong wind picks up, blowing westward at the back of the cart, lashing rain on Saoirse and [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md).

A thunderstorm breaks out, with rumbles of thunder heard around the party, indicating that they are heading directly into the storm. The treetops begin to sway and bend in the wind, giving a clear indication as to the intensity of the wind. The party presses on.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Saoirse lament the weather, hoping it will pass quickly.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Can't you magic hocus pocus people do something about this?

Torbra jokes that she can become giant but can't control the weather.

As the party is talking, a large bolt of thunder impacts a roadside tree 60ft back from the cart, shattering it instantly, the tree pieces collapsing to the side of the road. It startles the party, Saoirse remarking at how insane this weather is.

Saoirse asks if the party should continue or stop to protect themselves. Torbra explains that they are most likely safer on the road than amongst the trees around them, though the threat of a tree falling is present. Saoirse agrees. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks if the [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) in the party have any magic that can protect them from falling trees. Saoirse points out her Eldritch Blast could blast something out of the way.

For the next 20 minutes the party continues without any nearby lighting bolts, but with the threat ever present.

## The Road is Blocked

Cresting a small undulation in the road, Torbra and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) see a downed tree 40ft down the road ahead of them. From the left side of the road its trunk has snapped under the force of the wind and its old age, collapsing it across the road, its branches resting on a 10ft rise to the right of the road. The road is blocked.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) encourages Saoirse to user her magic to move the tree, but Saoirse says this looks more like a job for giant Torbra. Torbra stops the cart 30ft away from the tree. Thanea looks around the area, noticing the tree's roots are still mostly in the ground. She also spots a large tree slightly further forward to the right and a dirt path beyond it, disappearing up to the higher shelf of land to the right of the downed tree, curving to the left as it goes.

She informs the party about the narrow path. Torbra expresses her caution, describing their current situation as perfect for an ambush, putting the party on alert. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks if the tree looks like it was cut down, but neither Torbra or Thanea can tell. [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) gets ready to cast Eldritch Blast at the first sign of trouble while [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) casts Mage Armour on herself.

Torbra begins to get down from the cart to go and take a closer look, but Thanea stops her with a hand on her shoulder. Thanea casts Light on a pear before throwing it in the direction of the tree. It lands half way between the cart and the tree, providing no useful illumination on the tree. Torbra continues to get down, reading her halberd and approaching the tree.

Thanea also gets down, looking for movement. Saoirse crouches in the back of the cart, keeping her eyes above the cart's edge for danger. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) relaxes backwards into the pears, waiting to see what happens.

Torbra reaches the tree, finding the trunk shattered from what looks like storm damage. 

As Thanea approaches the horses at the front of the cart she faintly catches the sound of nearby ogres talking, not able to identify the origin, only their rough direction to the right of the road. She informs the party, causing Torbra to head back to the cart cautiously, halberd at the ready.

## Charging Ogres

The pair then begin to hear multiple stomping footsteps approaching them, a bassy thud with each footfall, as the ogres run down the hill. Torbra sprints back to the cart to regroup.

The party looks on as three ogres come charging down the side path, wooden great clubs in hand with metal and bone pushed into them. They stand 12ft tall, large foreboding creatures with beastly humanoid faces.

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) peers over the side of the cart to see what's going on. She sees three ogres charging directly towards the cart.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Well shit, they don't look vegetarian!

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) rushes to the right hand side of the cart and casts Fireball towards the ogres, all three caught in the rapidly expanding fireball. The tree to their right bursts into flames, as does the one to the left on the hill above. Steam is briefly visible as the heat of the fire burns off the rain and moisture.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) charges forward, placing herself between the cart and the ogres. She uses Giant's Might to grow larger before holding her ground, preparing to strike one of them with her halberd if they approach.

A fourth ogre emerges from the ablaze tree at the top of the cliff, shouting "fire!" in giant, which Torbra understands. It flees to the cliff edge before throwing a javelin at Torbra, catching her in the leg. The lead ogre dashes towards Thanea. The second ogre charges towards Torbra. As it does, Torbra attempts to slice at it with her halberd, but swings wide. She is able to avoid its great club as it slams into the ground. The third ogre charges towards the cart.

[Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) rises from the cart and casts Eldritch Blast, one blast at the ogre in front of Thanea, the other at the ogre charging the cart. The first blast misses, ripping droplets from the air as it flies between Thanea and the ogre. The second impacts the ogre, doing minimal damage but pushing it backwards with its force. Saoirse climbs down from the cart, lurking behind its back corner for cover.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) gets up and moves to the right hand side of the cart and casts Dissonant Whispers on the ogre in front of Thanea, playing a discordant song on her lute which pierces the mind of the ogre. It winces, taking psychic damage, before turning and running back in the direction it came. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) gives Bardic Inspiration to Torbra.

Thanea uses Radiant Soul to sprout her radiant wings, flying 20ft into the air and away from the ogres. Torbra continues swinging at the ogre in front of her, managing to connect with it once. She uses Action Surge to attack again, hitting twice including a critical hit, wounding it severely.

The ogre tries to retaliate but misses. It cries "it's not fair!" in giant, turning to flee, but Torbra slices it as it turns, landing a second critical hit, finishing it off. The clifftop ogre tries to throw another javelin at Thanea but misses, the javelin sinking into the ground near Saoirse. The ogre attacking the cart slams its great club into the cart's side in an attempt to hit [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), damaging the cart but missing her as she lurches backwards. The ogre previously engaged with Thanea returns to the fray, engaging with Torbra but missing.

Saoirse steps round from the side of the cart and blasts the closest ogre with Eldritch Blast, both blasts connecting, pushing it into the tree behind it. She ducks back behind the cart, moving to its front.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) leaps from the cart, running over to the ogre pushed to the tree. She stabs it with her rapier, shouting at it as she goes, her words cutting it with psychic damage. The ogre recoils while pinned against the tree, visibly drained and struggling to fight on.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Don't fucking touch my cart.

Thanea casts Scorching Ray, 3 beams of fire energy flowing from her fingertips. One beam hits the ogre [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is engaged with, her Radiant Soul enhancing its damage. The ogre is pierced by the beam through the neck, it collapsing sideways from the blast. Thanea pumps the other two beams into the ogre on the clifftop, striking it decisively as it continues to look confused at the flying [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md). Thanea sticks her tongue out at it before flying away, over the back of the cart.

Torbra continues slicing at the ogre in front of her, using the Bardic Inspiration from [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to connect. She slices its blubbery belly open, almost felling it. The ogre hits back with its great club, it crashing down on Torbra's shoulder, one of the bone fragments sinking into her shoulder. The clifftop ogre throws a javelin at Torbra in support, but the javelin impacts the great club before it [clatters](../characters/clatter.md) to the ground. The ogre, frustrated and scared, begins to run away.

Saoirse steps round from behind the cart and casts Eldritch Blast twice at the ogre Torbra is battling. She slides on the mud underfoot, causing both of her blasts to fire off into the tree above Torbra, breaking a small branch which falls down and hits Torbra on the head inconsequentially. Torbra thinks nothing of it, the thunderstorm and high winds still raging all around them.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) points at the ogre in front of Torbra while laughing before her face gets serious. As she says "perish", it looks at her and screams before its eyes roll back in its head, the psychic damage finishing it off. The ogre collapses to the floor in front of Torbra.

As the final ogre flees, Thanea flies after it, casting Scorching Ray. Two of the three beams impact it, and with the added radiant damage from Radiant Soul, the beams impacting its back cause the ogre to collapse forward and slide 5ft across the slick grass.

*[Initiative order ends]*

The party begins searching the ogres, each character searching a different body:

| Character | Items |
| --- | --- |
| [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) | Small animal bones x30 |
| [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | Bloodstone necklace (50 gp value) |
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | Dead fox, rusty dagger sheathed in its mouth |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | Spear, ration (day) x1 |

[Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) notices that [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) has taken a few hits, so uses Healing Hands on her.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) is flying between the ogre corpse and the group, 10ft above the ground, when her wings fade away suddenly, Radiant Soul coming to an end. She begins to plummet, but [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) sees her begin to fall and casts Feather Fall, slowing her descent as she begins to tumble forward through the air. Thanea lands softly.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Thank you for not letting me eat dirt.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)*
> It didn't look appetising, so...

## Clearing the Road

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) marches over to the tree to begin heaving it out of the road. [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) stops her, insisting on trying Eldritch Blast first. She blasts the tree trunk twice, but the most that happens is that the nearby branches wiggle.

Torbra pushes her entire strength into the tree, pushing the trunk away from the cart in an attempt to rotate the tree to the side of the road. The roots still attached to the ground give resistance, so she is only able to move it half way to her goal. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) pipes up, inspiring Torbra to finish the job.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Come on big boy, you can do it.

Inspired by [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), Torbra digs deeper and pushes even harder. The roots giving resistance begin to snap one by one until the tension is released, causing the tree to move at speed away from Torbra, clattering into the tree line by the side of the road, coming to rest where she intended to move it to.

Thanea playfully remarks at Torbra's strength, Torbra happily joking back.

## Continuing to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md)

With the road now clear, the party gets back in their cart, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) once again driving while [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) navigates.

The day remains rainy as the party proceeds west along the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md), though the thunderstorm is now behind them and the winds have calmed down. By evening they pass the turning up the [Carn Path](../places/roads/carn-path.md) towards Hartsgarth and Carnmere, proceeding for several more hours before making camp for the night. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) casts Tiny Hut to shield the party overnight.

During the night there is a commotion on the road as [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) come and go, unbeknownst to the party dealing with the fallout from the storm.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

In the morning the party resumes their journey. The rain has stopped but the road is muddy, the cart's wheels sinking into muddy ruts along the mostly gravel covered road. The weather remains cloudy.

## Arriving at [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md)

By early afternoon a first view of [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) is visible to the party. The [River Carn](../places/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) has been winding alongside the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) all day. As it gets close to the road again, a large 20ft wall can be seen that spans the land from the river on the left to the forest line to the right. Battlements can be seen atop the wall, and a large gatehouse comes into view where the road intersects the wall.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is happy to be arriving but describes the town as "a pit".

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) keeps an eye out on the gate house. She observes a few horses and carts ahead as a queue is forming as road traffic slows on entry to the town, but sees no [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) anywhere. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) thinks nothing of it, knowing [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) to be a former military stronghold that is now only patrolled as much as the next town.

Torbra leads the cart through the gatehouse, finding no guards or gate checkpoint to contend with. Proceeding through as the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) passes through the middle of the town, she is quickly flagged down, two buildings down by a worker (wearing drab leathers and a grey flat cap) who waves at her to pull into the cart entrance of the [Hyceodd Trade Post](../places/buildings/stables/hyceodd-trade-post.md). Torbra complies, instructing the horses to enter the opening in the side of the building.

## Delivering the Pears

Inside Torbra finds a large barn-like interior with stalls for horses and carts. [Upton McAran](../characters/upton-mcaran.md), stood in the middle of the interior, approaches the cart and speaks to Thanea who is closest.

*[Upton McAran](../characters/upton-mcaran.md):*
> Looks like you're one of ours.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> We're here to deliver pears.

*[Upton McAran](../characters/upton-mcaran.md):*
> Okay. Stall number six!

Thanea thanks Upton as her and Torbra cooperate on moving the horses and cart into the correct stall as instructed.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) hops out the back of the cart and goes over to Upton to strike up a conversation with him. He quickly learns that the party are delivering pears from [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). Upton inquires about the heavy rain overnight, commenting that they seemed to survive the conditions. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) tells him that they ran into ogres, Upton calling it a risk of the job.

Upton inspects the cart, finding the damage from the ogre's great club. He calls it "regular wear and tear" before inspecting the cargo of pears. He declares them to be "wet, but they'll sell", overall happy with the delivery. He fetches two other stable hands to unload the bags of pears while the party stand to one side.

After the entire cargo is appraised, Upton informs [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) that the cargo is worth about 47 gp, less than she paid in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) for it. She is resigned to the news but calls Upton a good guy, instead asking him for 45 gp. Upton shows some muted appreciation before taking the coin pouch he was going to pass to [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), removing 2 gp and pocketing it for himself.

Torbra is surprised that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) would give away money so flippantly, but she rationalises it as paying for the damage to the cart, saying that the party has plenty of money.

When [Upton McAran](../characters/upton-mcaran.md) asks [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) her name, she lies, calling herself "Bertha Halfstring". [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) audibly snorts at her first name. Upton offers [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) more work if the party has need of it. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is thankful but explains that the party has business in town for now, so maybe later.

Upton gets back to work, pointing to a pair of stable hands who are unloading a cart carrying logs. He warns them about how they're carrying it, but too late as one of the stable hands drops his end of the log, it crushing his foot. The other stable hand keeps his end of the log held up while he watches on in shock. The stable hand falls backwards to the ground in agony.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), to the party:*
> Well that'll leave a mark.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) heads over to help, by which point Upton and the other stable hand have lifted the log from the foot of the injured stable hand. She observes blood and a bone sticking out from his leather shoe.

Thanea casts Healing Hands on the foot, causing the injury to heal around his broken foot, the bone still visibly broken from the bulge on the top of his foot. Upton processes what he's just seen quizzically before taking decisive action. He places two hands on the foot and snaps the bone back into place. The stable hand screams in agony for a moment before passing out from the pain. Upton reassures Thanea that he'll be okay. Thanea wishes them well before excusing herself.

## Exploring [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md)

The party emerges from the [Hyceodd Trade Post](../places/buildings/stables/hyceodd-trade-post.md), finding themselves on the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) with the gatehouse to their right and the middle of [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) to their left, with a slight view of the marketplace much further down.
