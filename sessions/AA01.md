## Introduction

> [South East Kardan](../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md) is the perfect place for life to flourish. A land nestled between the snow capped mountain ranges and hemmed in by the [Sea of Songs](../places/seas/sea-of-songs.md). The land in between is verdant grassy plains, rolling hills, lush forests, snaking rivers and lakes cradled by the mountains.
>
> It was here that the [gods](../gods/gods.md) brought humans, halflings, and gnomes. Here they were destined to make something of themselves, and so in good time, the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) formed. It is strong, prosperous, and militaristic. It welcomes anyone with open arms, but punishes harshly those that don't obey.
>
> Though most of the kingdom is controlled by the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), the large military organisation that handles everything from war planning to guard duty, there exists a smaller organisation with a humbler purpose. The [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). Protectors of and against nature, keeping Astor's ambition balanced with the natural order.
>
> Two to four years ago, you began a journey to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) ranks. Being invited to the recruitment programme is no small feat - the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) are small in number and selective, but that didn't stand in your way. Neither did the training which saw you working with [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mentors to hone your skills and learn about the natural world around you.
>
> Today is graduation day. It's been a long time coming. Over the last week this year's cohort of 100 graduates has finished the 8 day journey from [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md), the coastal city where the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) train all of their new hopefuls, to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), the shining city on the lake and the capital of the kingdom.
>
> Here is where our story begins.

## Graduation Ceremony Speech

*See: [Astorrel Graduation](../storylines/astorrel-graduation.md)*  
*See: [Astorrel vs Astornox](../storylines/astorrel-vs-astornox.md)*

All 100 graduates present in [Kirrel Hall](../places/buildings/kirrel-hall.md), lined up and watching the stage. Other [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) look on from the sides.

[Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) welcomes everyone to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md):

*Announcer*

> Introducing [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md), [Astorrel Captain](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-captain.md) of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md)!

*[Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md)*

> Welcome to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), the finest city in Astor. It is my pleasure as the Captain of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) to welcome you all here today. I hope that today is one that you remember for the rest of your days, and I hope to work with some of you soon. Best of luck to you all.

[Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) gives the opening speech of the graduation ceremony:

*Announcer*

> And now the commencement speech from [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md), [Astorrel Commandant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md)!

*[Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md)*

> On today, Mishdag 2nd of Finsbock in the year 312, it is my great pleasure to commence the annual [Astorrel Graduation](../storylines/astorrel-graduation.md) Ceremony for the 100 graduates present here. Welcome.
>
> You've all worked hard to get here. You've spent 2 to 4 years honing your skills in [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md) so that you can join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), Astor's organisation charged with upholding the ideals of [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) the Generous: to protect nature and its bounties so that future generations can enjoy and benefit from them.
>
> In many ways this is the end of a journey, but actually the real journey begins today. Today you'll pledge yourselves to one of the insider [gods](../gods/gods.md), receive your badge, rank, & graduation purse, and then you'll meet your superior officer so you can begin your service.
>
> Remember your training. Be vigilant yet cautious, responsible yet reactive, understanding yet just.
>
> For those of you who become Squad Hands and Squad Leads today, I offer you on final piece of advice. Be respectful and considerate to the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) we work alongside. I have seen much tension between our organisations recently. Don't embarrass our organisation by throwing kindling on the fire.

The announcer explains the next step of the graduation ceremony:

- Go to [Diamond Prime](../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md) in [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md) and pledge yourself to one of the insider [gods](../gods/gods.md).
- Return here with proof of the deed, within 1 hour.

## Graduation Pledge

The recruits begin to make their way out of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) and into [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md) where [Diamond Prime](../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md) is. The route is lined with citizens ([Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), and retired citizens) here to watch and cheer the graduates on.

4 lines form outside [Diamond Prime](../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md), one for each door (left to right: [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md), [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md), [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md), [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md)). The [players](../../../players/logan.md) lined up at the door they intended to choose.

Inside [Diamond Prime](../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md), only one worshipper is present at each shrine at a time. They pray in whichever way they choose, before a caretaker marks their forehead with a coloured paint with the symbol of their chosen god.

| Character | God | Prayer Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) | Touches statue |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) | Both hands on statue. Talks out loud with reverence. Mentions "[Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md)' Kiss" in her eye. Taps statue several times. |
| [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) | Solemnly knees and bows head. |
| [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) | Eyes downcast, hands clasped behind their back. |

The statue of [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) is a hawk with its wings spread wide, 2ft in wingspan. It is made of yellow to orange coloured gems and appears to otherwise be solid gold.

### Whisper [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) Chat 1

While Whisper of the Breeze is praying to [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md), they notice the statue begin to grow brighter, hurting her eyes with its brightness. The female voice of [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) echoes through the room and Whisper's ears.

*[Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md)*:

> No need to be so glum.

Whisper takes the voice in, but does not visibly react. She is taken aback, but doesn't react in a way that draws attention to themselves. After looking away from the statue briefly, the glow vanishes in an instant. Whisper doesn't notice that the caretaker didn't react either (only Whisper saw the glow and heard the voice).

## Graduation Presentation

Back in [Kirrel Hall](../places/buildings/kirrel-hall.md), each graduate now receives their badge, rank, and graduation purse. Graduates are called up in name order and walk across the stage, from stage left to stage right.

- [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) pins the badge on their robe and shakes their hand.
- [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) gives them their graduation purse (pouch) and bows.

### Superior Officer Assignments

Following the graduation presentation, the announcer explains that a board at the other side of the room will show you who your superior officer is, and where to report to. Those posted to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) must immediately report to their superior officers, as they are waiting.

There is a fairly equal split between [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md), and [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md).

Job board:

- [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md)
  - [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md), [Auric Rise](../places/buildings/auric-rise.md), 3H
    - [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md)
    - [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md)
    - [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)
    - [Morgan Caithness](../characters/morgan-caithness.md)
    - [Penance Zahiri](../characters/penance-zahiri.md)
    - [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md)
    - [Tabari Se](../characters/tabari-se.md)
    - [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md)

The [players](../../../players/logan.md), looking for other graduates with the symbol of [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) painted on their head, find each other, plus [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md). They chat for a while before looking for their assignment on the board. Darius barely utters a word.

Finding that they must head to [Auric Rise](../places/buildings/auric-rise.md), 3H ([Bryce Morton's Office](../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md)), they choose to ask a nearby [Astorrel Lieutenant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-lieutenant.md), standing against a wall, for help. They explain to the group that [Auric Rise](../places/buildings/auric-rise.md) is a building, located outside of [Kirrel Hall](../places/buildings/kirrel-hall.md) and is the first building on the left as the street exits the small square outside. They slip away after [Grant Thackeray](../characters/grant-thackeray.md) and [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) come over to talk.

### Redwyn's Mentor

[Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md)'s mentor, [Grant Thackeray](../characters/grant-thackeray.md), approaches them at this point with [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md). Grant and Levelle are old friends, having been in the same squad when they joined the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

Grant congratulates Redwyn on making [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md), and wishes them all the best. Levelle does the same.

### Ephaine's Mentor

*See: [Retrieving Ephaine's Star Map](../storylines/retrieving-ephaines-star-map.md)*

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) looks around [Kirrel Hall](../places/buildings/kirrel-hall.md) and can't see her mentor, [Ludolf Hornwallis](../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md), anywhere. They have her star map and said they'd be here.

### [Auric Rise](../places/buildings/auric-rise.md)

Inside [Auric Rise](../places/buildings/auric-rise.md), many people are looking for their superior officers. The party quickly figures out that 3H corresponds to the third floor, and heads upstairs.

### [Bryce Morton's Office](../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md)

The [players](../../../players/logan.md) enter [Bryce Morton's office](../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md) where they find the members of [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md). Bryce is waiting within, sat at his desk. He stands up, introduces himself, and sits back down.

Firstly he splits the 8 [Astorrel Squad Hands](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) into two unnamed squads. Conveniently they're already stood in the correct groups of 4.

Next he explains how missions work: he provides them with missions to complete, they pay a bounty to each Squad Hand on completion, and that there may be time and evidence requirements.

Finally he explains that he intends to promote one person from each squad to [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md). Before making his choice he will give everyone chances to be acting Squad Lead so that they may prove themselves for the role. Each Squad Lead gets paid more, is held more responsible for mission successes & failures, and has opportunities for further promotion.

Bryce then leaves the room to get the squads their maps. During this time the party chat briefly about what squad name they should pick, while [Penance Zahiri](../characters/penance-zahiri.md) attempts fruitlessly to get [Tabari Se](../characters/tabari-se.md) to say something.

Bryce returns with his superior, [Samantha Ilis](../characters/samantha-ilis.md). She introduces herself, comments to Bryce that it looks like he has a good bunch, wishes everyone good luck, and leaves.

Bryce provides each squad with an [Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../papers/maps/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md).

He then instructs both squads to return here tomorrow at 10:00 to receive their first mission. Before then they should buy any equipment they need, eat & rest well, and enjoy what's left of their graduation day.

### Shopping on [Crafters Course](../places/streets/crafters-course.md)

The party make their way straight to [Crafters Course](../places/streets/crafters-course.md) after inquiring about the best place to buy what they need.

First they enter [S.Q. Wirral & Son](../places/buildings/shops/sq-wirral-and-son.md) as the line at the armoursmith is out of the door. 

- [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md): Chain mail, paid in full (75 gp), collect at sunset.
- [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md): leather, dyed black, paid half (5 gp), collect tomorrow.

Next they enter [Rhotrukk Wepons](../places/buildings/shops/rhotrukk-wepons.md) to buy their weapons. Nobody has any issues finding what they need, including a crossbow and bolts (Whisper), and a bow and arrows (Redwyn).

Afterwards they enter [Everything Else](../places/buildings/shops/everything-else.md) as Whisper wishes to buy lockpicking tools. They are able, as [Nilus Cray](../characters/nilus-cray.md) produces a set from the back room and sells them discretely. The rest of the party stock up on equipment kits and supplies.

The party tries their luck at [Friend of the Magicborn](../places/buildings/shops/friend-of-the-magicborn.md). Here they are faced with [Moss Under the Crumbling cliffs](../characters/moss-under-the-crumbling-cliffs.md), who is standoffish and evasive to their questioning.

- [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md): Asks what services they provide, gets no clear answer.
- [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md): Asks if they sell potions, gets a simple "yes".
- Redwyn: Yells at Moss for being unhelpful and non-descriptive. They respond: "how very astute of you".

Finally Ephaine wishes to buy spell materials, so the party next visits Grizgrep Reagents and Magical Curios. [Ormila Grizgrep](../characters/ormila-grizgrep.md) welcomes Ephaine inside as a rare and valued customer. Ahsha is welcomed less enthusiastically. Ephaine buys a component bag while Ahsha buys a small jar of 3 grasshopper legs. Redwyn buys a bottle of perfume at a haggled down price.

### Sitting Down for Food

The party decides they want to get some food as it's getting on towards sunset.

Beforehand, they swing back past [S.Q. Wirral & Son](../places/buildings/shops/sq-wirral-and-son.md) to collect Ahsha's chain mail armour which is now ready to collect. [Sandor Wirral](../characters/sandor-wirral.md) and [Clyde Wirral](../characters/clyde-wirral.md) are passing orders to waiting customers from their back room.

The party passes [The Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) and after sticking their head inside and seeing the homely wooden tavern feel, they decide to go inside. The atmosphere is party-like.

They meet [Tydrus Tinshield](../characters/tydrus-tinshield.md) behind the bar. They all order plates of pork and drinks. Redwyn speaks to Tydrus in dwarvish, trying to convince him to sell a Fox Tail Brewery "Blood Moon" (1 sp) for 1 cp. He insists that they must buy two rounds at full price before he'd even consider such a deal. Ahsha interjects that they're celebrating and offers to start a tab with 3 gp.

The party grabs a table.
