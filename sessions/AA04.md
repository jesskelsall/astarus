## Outside the [Blue Kobold Cave](../places/caves/blue-kobold-cave.md)

Faced with the mouth of a cave ahead of them, the party debates their next course of action. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) apologises for splitting a kobold in half during their previous encounter.

The party decides to send someone into the cave to try and negotiate, [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) agreeing to go in alone and unarmed. Trying to make her way in carefully, she kicks a rock which creates a noise.

## Kobolds in the Cave

As Redwyn rounds the corner where the cave narrows, she finds a reasonably sized room containing multiple kobolds, including several kobold dragonshields. They are ready for her and have moved into defensive positions, clutching spears and knives.

Redwyn tries to talk to the kobolds but quickly realises that they don't speak common. When she gets frustrated with this, she casts Vicious Mockery on the dragonshield in front of her. In turn it tries to take a stab at her, beginning combat.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Redwyn rushes to the mouth of the cave to escape. The rest of the party hears her fleeing, jumping into action. There is a heated back and forth in the mouth of the cave as the kobolds press forward while the party tries their best to hold a defensive stance, not wishing to attack the kobolds.

At one point [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) grabs the spear from a kobold dragonshield and breaks it over her knee, disarming it. This scares the kobolds enough to disengage back into the previous room. When Ahsha tries to pursue them, another dragonshield throws its spear at her, clearly still wary of the party's presence in their home.

Meanwhile, Ephaine grabs the restrained kobold that they captured from the previous fight and drags it into the mouth of the cave. Here Ahsha helps her untie it. The kobold immediately makes a break for freedom, vanishing deeper into the cave.

Ephaine casts Mending on the broken spear and passes it back to a kobold, offering it as a sign of peace. The kobold takes the spear before the defending group retreat into the cave. The party leaves the mouth of the cave, a tense encounter resolved without further bloodshed.

*[Initiative order ends]*

With the encounter over, the party resolves to return to [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) and tell the villagers of what they've learned.

## Returning to [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md)

As the party makes their way back to the [Arnaside Logging Camp](../places/structures/arnaside-logging-camp.md), the winds pick up again, blowing a heavy gale. As a result the party decides to take a short rest in the logging camp's hut.

*[Short rest]*

The party make their way back down the hill and into [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md), stopping first at [the Malneshitas](../places/buildings/temples/the-malneshitas.md) to speak with [Nenra Zossa](../characters/nenra-zossa.md). The party discuss with her the kobolds they have found, which Nenra isn't aware of, not having any first-hand knowledge of the creatures that have been causing [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) trouble.

The party asks Nenra is anyone in town speaks other languages, as they've not been able to communicate with the kobolds. Nenra tells them of [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md), a dragonborn who runs the [Head & Haft](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/head-and-haft.md) tavern.

The party split up to speak with people:

| Characters | Location |
| --- | --- |
| [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)<br>[Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) ([Head & Haft](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/head-and-haft.md)) |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md)<br>[Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | [Kulegar Bronhor](../characters/kulegar-bronhor.md) (his house) |

### With Kulegar

Ahsha and Whisper find [Kulegar Bronhor](../characters/kulegar-bronhor.md)'s house and knock on the door. He answers, ushering them inside out of the breeze. First they apologise for Ephaine, explaining her cutting a kobold in half as an accident and not characteristic of her behaviour. Kulegar is still wary of the party because of it but trusts them.

Kulegar is also apprehensive when the pair inform him that they returned the captured kobold to its kin in a cave they found north in the forest. Once again he trusts their judgement, hoping that they know what they're doing.

The pair tell Kulegar that the loggers should keep away from the forest for the time being while things are worked out. Kulegar tells them that he will shut the logging camp down for now.

When Ahsha offers to buy Kulegar a drink at the tavern later, Kulegar expresses concern that there may not be any drink left for her to buy, hinting at how out of supplies [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) is now that they're unable to sell their wood.

### With [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md)

Ephaine and Redwyn enter the [Head & Haft](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/head-and-haft.md) tavern. Here they find a couple quietly chatting over by the fire who treat them with suspicion before quietly resuming their conversation. They also find the tavern keeper, [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md), behind the bar looking bored.

When they approach, [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) looks terrified, not trusting the strangers present in the village. He knows who they are immediately, word clearly getting round.

As they inform him that they need his help, he shrinks behind the bar, talking softly and trying to hide, insisting that they should ask someone else for help and to leave him alone. He is clearly scared and lacking confidence.

When Redwyn tries to convince him to join them so they can communicate with the kobolds in draconic, he refuses. Ephaine tries as well but only manages to get him to agree to teach them some words in draconic. When Ahsha and Whisper join Ephaine and Redwyn in the tavern, they are pointed out to [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) by Ephaine and Redwyn. [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) asks Redwyn about the tabaxi, seemingly interested in Whisper. Ahsha and Whisper and then properly introduced to [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) before they try themselves to get [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) to join them. This succeeds when [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) asks if Whisper will be coming and the answer is yes.

The party learn the following words in draconic:

- Yes
- No
- Stop
- Wait
- Peace

Additionally Ahsha asks [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) what the word for leader is. [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) teaches this to Ahsha, but explains that the word doesn't translate well - in draconic it is more like "the one that holds the power".

With it getting dark, the party asks [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) where they'd be able to stay in the village. As [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) isn't accustomed to (or wanting of) visitors, there really isn't anywhere. [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) offers to put them up in the tavern overnight, offering them a spot by the fire to place their bedrolls. He politely asks them to refrain from taking anything from the bar while here alone overnight.

*[Long rest]*

## Whisper [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) Chat 3

During the night [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) wakes up. They see their party sleeping inside the tavern, but a light outside distracts them. They make their way to the door quietly and step outside.

It is quiet out and the wind is notably absent. Looking around they see a hawk on the edge of the next building over's roof, resembling the shrine to [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) in [Diamond Prime](../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md) - golden and shining through its many gemstones. It is casting light around it.

As Whisper approaches it, there is a flash of light. They suddenly find themself high in the sky above a desert landscape bathed in sunlight. To their side they see a large hawk who they presume is [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md). Getting their bearings they realise that they are also a bird, flying alongside [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) over the desert.

As they fly together they approach a village (Kuv'narash) and descend.

*[Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md):*

> This is Kuv'narash.

It is made of dried dirt, a maze of connected buildings with open windows. The people here are predominantly the lesser races of [South East Kardan](../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md) - mostly tabaxi and dragonborn. The people they fly past look poor and are simply trying to make ends meet.

Flying through the streets, [Whisper and Valnos](../storylines/ended/whisper-and-valnos.md) descend on a building, landing on its window sill. This open hole in the side of the building gives them a view inside. Here Whisper sees a family of tabaxi, living in cramped conditions. The colour of their fur and markings is immediately recognisable to Whisper, matching their own.

Whisper sees a mother in childbirth, her cubs emerging one by one as another female tabaxi helps her, moving them onto a blanket. The last cub is born, the runt of the litter, crying as it makes its way into the world.

*[Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md):*

> That's you.

A male tabaxi makes his way over to the mother and the cubs. He kisses Whisper on the forehead before embracing the mother. Whisper doesn't recognise this figure as their father.

The dream ends. Whisper wakes up in the morning by the fire, feeling content and energised.

## Back to the Cave

In the morning the party is greeted by [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) who returns to the tavern to make them breakfast, egg sandwiches.

Before departing the party checks in on [Clay Mullen](../characters/clay-mullen.md) who is still patiently waiting for them. He explains that he's happy waiting for a while longer despite his boredom and his horse Secret getting spooked by the prevalent winds on the coast.

The party heads out with [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md). He asks Whisper to keep him safe, expressing comfort in their presence.

Back at the [Arnaside Logging Camp](../places/structures/arnaside-logging-camp.md) the party check for any evidence of kobold activity but find none. They press on to the mouth of the cave.

## Negotiations in Draconic

The party asks [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) to try to talk to the kobolds from the mouth of the cave. He reluctantly agrees, shouting "peace" into the cave mouth.

There is a terse dialogue in draconic shouted between both groups through the echoing cave mouth. [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) explains that the kobolds are interested in talking, and to wait where they are for a bit.

After 30 minutes 6 kobold dragonshields emerge from the cave. One steps forward and talks to [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md), explaining that the kobolds are willing to talk, but that it must be inside the cave, and only [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) and one other may enter. Initially Ahsha gets the wrong idea, assuming that their leader would meet them out here, but instead the notion of descending into their cave is worrying.

Ahsha asks for a trade, which the kobolds agree to. Two dragonshields are ordered to throw their shield and spears to the ground and give themselves over to the rest of the party. They aren't tied up, but stay to one side, treating the party with extreme suspicion.

Ahsha volunteers to go with, exercising her role as acting [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) on this mission. The kobolds pull out grain sacks to place over their heads, intending to lead them both into the cave blindfolded so they can't find their way out easily. Both Ahsha and [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) reluctantly agree.

As [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md) is being blindfolded, he asks Whisper to tell him that everything will be okay. Whisper does.

The pair are lead into the cave by the other four kobold dragonshields, leaving Ephaine, Redwyn, Whisper and two dragonshields alone on the forest's edge, waiting for Ahsha and [Sharakas](../characters/sharakas.md)' return.
