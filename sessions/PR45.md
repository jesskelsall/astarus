## Fighting Alongside Allisa

*[Initiative order resumes]*

With [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) having arrived via Dimension Door into the middle of a battle with three [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) in the northern plains of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md), she jumps straight into action, joining the party in their fight for survival.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) flinches at the sight of Allisa:

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> What the fuck!

She backs up from the hunter between [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), charging at it with her halberd. It scrapes along its spiny back, chipping some of its stony hide away, turning back to [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) as it is removed.

The hunter turns to Torbra, slicing Torbra twice, once critically. In two decisive blows it wipes out the last of her strength, Torbra falling to the ground unconscious. One of the clifftop hunters blasts [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) with force energy, the other clifftop hunter inflicting the same blast on [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md). The blast knocks [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) from her feet as she loses consciousness.

Saoirse shouts for someone to help the pair up before stepping over Torbra to place herself between both unconscious party members. She casts Shatter on the clifftop hunters, both ringing with thunderous energy from the abrasive sound. One takes extra necrotic damage from her Necrotic Shroud. Its hind legs collapse to dust from the reverberation, it briefly falling to the ground before a rippling wave of dust passes over its body from back to front as it reforms new, thinner legs, standing once more.

Thanea casts Aid on [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), Torbra, and herself, healing them and increasing their maximum hit points temporarily, bringing both [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Torbra back to consciousness. She repositions herself behind the party in relation to the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md).

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) casts Wall of Fire, sweeping her staff as if drawing a line across the clifftop. As it goes bright radiant light can be seen flashing along the cliff edge before it bursts into flames, a tall wall of flames jumping into the air. The flames obscure the party's view of the hunters as they hear the flames roar while the trees behind flash burn and pop, water and sap sublimating within them.

Torbra gets to her feet before resuming her flurry of halberd strikes against the hunter amongst the party. The panic and delirium of waking causes her to over-exert herself, the hunter dodging both attacks easily.

The hunter amongst the party turns to Saoirse, slashing her twice. Both times her Armour of Agathys races from her shoulders to the hunter's claws, icing it up and dealing it significant damage, though expending her spell in the process. It recoils from the damage, teleporting to the top of a distant rock.

The hunters engulfed in flames run down the cliff, emerging from the Wall of Fire, racing up to Allisa, intent on slashing her simultaneously from flanking positions. As the first strike comes in from in front, she uses Warding Flare to attempt to put the hunter off its attack with a flash of radiant light, but it has no eyes with which to be dazzled, so the attack lands. As another strike comes in she casts Shield, the blade bouncing off an invisible wall of energy that briefly surrounds her. As another hit comes in it pushes past the shield, slicing her on her side, blood flowing from the wound quickly. The hunters then teleport to opposite sides of the area, one at the top of the cliff in an area not engulfed in flames.

Saoirse places her hands on herself and casts Healing Hands before moving behind Thanea, taking cover between her ally and the nearby tree. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), now conscious, crawls towards Torbra and Allisa before casting Bane, only affecting the clifftop hunter, the others out of range. She inspires Allisa to "fuck these things up".

Thanea casts Scorching Ray, throwing two fiery beams at the more injured [meteoric hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) at ground level, and a third that impacts the clifftop hunter. The weaker [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) is pierced by both blasts, its entire form losing its form and collapsing into a pile of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md).

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Can do.

Allisa throws a Fireball at the hunter on the clifftop, the wave of fire setting fire to more of the nearby trees. As the fireball dissipates she charges up the cliff, clumsily ascending using her staff, her shield still in hand, barely making it to the top in one movement.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> What are these things?

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> We don't know, but they're made of stone!

Torbra moves towards the hunter perched on a nearby rock, readying her halberd to strike if either of them teleport to her. As it teleports to attack [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), Torbra tries to swing at it, but doesn't expect it to teleport to someone else right at the edge of her reach, her swing going wide. It slashes at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), the first slice knocking her unconscious as she collapses, her concentration on Bane broken. As soon as she hits the ground it strikes down a second time, its blade arm puncturing right through her stomach and into the ground beyond, bringing her to the verge of death (2 death save failures).

The clifftop hunter meets Allisa at the cliff edge, slicing at her twice. Both hits land, cutting deep across her chest. She winces before throwing up blood inside of her helmet, the toll of battle beginning to wear her down.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) shouts "fuck you" at the hunter looming over [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), casting Eldritch Blast. Both blasts impact it, pushing it 15ft into the bottom of the cliff. She notices that the sheer force of the blast doesn't seem to affect the hunter much, it resistant to force damage. Fearing for the current situation, she dives behind a nearby tree, shouting for someone to heal [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md).

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) rushes to [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), casting Healing Hands on her, bringing back to consciousness. As she gasps awake she returns to her previous position, keeping distance between herself and the hunters.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)*
> Stay awake now, it's not sleeping time!

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) uses Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn. The party watches as a source of light grows bright from her, resembling the morning sun as it appears over the horizon, momentarily blindingly bright. Both [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) are hit with radiant energy. The one that was pushed into the cliff is unable to stay together any longer, radiant energy crackling through its body as the bonds holding its [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) together fail before it collapses into its constituent dust.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) charges over to the cliff, ascending a lower section easily with her earth genasi rocky terrain aptitude, reaching the back of the final [meteoric hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md). She strikes it with her halberd twice, landing two decisive hits, continuing the slow process of chipping away at it. The hunter reacts by teleporting to the lower clearing, rushing over to Saoirse and slicing at her twice. Two deep wounds knock her unconscious before it charges out from behind the tree, rushing towards Thanea for its next strike.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) once again stands up, meeting the hunter by Thanea and stabbing it with her rapier. The area around the puncture wound gives way into dust, surprising the hunter which recoils, surprising [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) who misses with her follow up dagger stab. Thanea blasts the hunter at point-blank with Scorching Ray, using Restore Balance to land a better hit with one beam. She extends her hand, three beams erupting like a shotgun blast, two hitting as the energy from Radiant Soul courses through its body. The beams impact its head, destroying it completely as the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) begins to smoulder, cascading across its back and body, collapsing the last [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) progressively as the damage spreads, its entire body returning to dust.

## Battle Aftermath

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md), to [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Is it over? Are you okay?

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) looks down from the clifftop, not seeing any more creatures to target. When she notices the pile of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) at [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s feet she realises that the battle is won, dropping Wall of Fire. This reveals the nearby trees which have now burned so completely that what remains of their trunks is carbonised. She makes her way back down the cliff, approaching the party. She asks if everyone is alright, noting that someone is unaccounted for.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) leaps from the cliff towards the party, landing with a giant thud. She questions if the fight is over, wary of danger that may teleport in at a moment's notice. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) collapses with a sigh, happy the fight is over.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> What the fuck were those things? So where's that other weirdo at?

The party realises that [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is missing, an ominous sign. Thanea and Torbra fan out and begin looking for her, Thanea finding her face down in the grass in the shady base of a nearby tree. She calls everyone else over, unsure how best to help her.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) rushes over, throwing her staff and shield to the ground, collapsing to her knees next to Saoirse. She grabs her by the shoulder, forcibly flips her over and casts Healing Hands, bringing her back to consciousness. Thanea asks Saoirse what happened, Saoirse recanting trying to hide but getting caught out away from the party. Thanea is happy to see her okay.

## Tense Discussions

Allisa goes back to her staff and shield, picking them both up and remaining a short distance away from the party, instinctually wary of strangers from the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). Thanea turns to her, noticing her breathing heavily as she recovers from energetic combat.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> So you're like us, right?

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I think so. Yes and no. It depends what you mean.

Thanea says that she doesn't know what she means, explaining that they have been muddling through recent events, unsure what it all means. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) begins talking about [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md), pointing out that this is their third encounter with similar creatures. Thanea interrupts her to point out that they're talking about their shared gifts.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), still coming to her senses, stands and begins walking towards Allisa. She gets only a few steps before Allisa raises her staff, pointing it directly at Saoirse.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> That's far enough.

Saoirse is confused, asking if Allisa was the one talking to her in her head. Allisa says that their situation is complicated, pointing at the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) military badge on Saoirse's chest.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> The last time I came across your kind, one of my colleagues died.

Saoirse asks if she's not confusing [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) with a "bunch of fuckwits" with anger issues, Thanea suggesting that Saoirse is talking about the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). Allisa makes it clear that she definitely means the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), noting the square badge, showing her knowledge. When Saoirse says that the party isn't the type to do things like that, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) scoffs.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Look, I apologise, but the reason I'm being cautious is... I'm with the Syntenne.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> You've got some balls being out here, then.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> You could say that, if I had any.

Saoirse tries to assure Allisa that they've helped "people like you" before, Thanea adding that they didn't join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) willingly and have no personal feelings about elves or the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). Allisa retorts that they've not met anyone like her before, alluding to her Scourge [Aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) lineage. Saoirse tells her the basics of [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) helping [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) escape the Humar Estuary before Allisa cuts her off.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I don't think you understand what I'm saying. I'm a [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) Veritacris. I'm a spy.

Allisa's staff stays raised and pointed at Saoirse. Thanea asks why she is telling the party this, particularly as they're just trying to survive and have nothing to do with the war. Saoirse questions how genuine she is being, as telling people you're a spy isn't very becoming of one.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> No, I... I want to be your friend. But I need you to understand how much I've risked to be here.

She points at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md).

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> As this one has quite astutely observed, I'm quite far from home and it hasn't gone terribly well. I've spent the last fifty years looking for you both.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and Saoirse are both surprised, Saoirse stating her age as 17, Thanea adding she is not much older. Allisa corrects them - she has been looking for someone like her. Thanea empathises with her, as she and Saoirse are just trying to figure themselves out. Torbra suggests that Allisa being a spy is likely the least interesting thing about the entire group of five.

## We Are [Aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md)

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) asks the party if there are any other military members in the area, urging them to answer honestly. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) explains that another squad ([Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)) has passed through the area recently, but the party has no idea what their mission is or where they currently are. Allisa asks that the party keeps an eye out for them, and tells them not to be surprised if she suddenly disappears if they make an appearance.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) asks if Allisa is planning on coming with the party. She plainly states that she hadn't thought that far ahead. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) questions why Allisa would come all this way just to find her and Thanea, particularly as she doesn't know who or what she is, and contrasts herself to Thanea.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Well, [Minsas](../characters/minsas.md) showed me both of you in my dream. I think there's some significance there.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Wait, who?

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> My deva, [Minsas](../characters/minsas.md).

Saoirse, confused, asks Thanea if she knows what Allisa is speaking of, but she is only vaguely aware that it has divine meaning. Allisa explains that her deva brought her through the sandstorm to [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md) in her dream ([Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)), noting the parallels between her experience and that of Thanea and Saoirse's. The pair both realise who Allisa is referring to, learning the name for their angelic guardians.

Allisa relates her experiences with dreams, noting that her deva gives her visions of other places which has included: [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md), the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) within it. She says that she tried to see her there, but wasn't able to reach her. Saoirse points out that Allisa didn't miss much as [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) lost the tournament ([Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md)), but Allisa is immediately dismissive, pointing out that the only thing that matters to her now is being right here with Thanea and Saoirse.

Saoirse questions how Allisa was able to find them, thanking her for arriving when she did. Thanea suggests it was her deva that lead her here, but Allisa disagrees, stating that she has the ability to see and speak to people in distant places.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) suggests that Allisa can see well "with her elven eyes". Allisa is dismissive, saying that her eyes aren't elven, once again alluding to her lineage. Torbra asks if she is elven before [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) firmly suggests that she take off her helmet and show them her face.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I'd rather not if we can avoid it.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> I mean it's a bit one-sided if we're talking to a face mask the whole time.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I would not call it one sided, the four of you standing across from the one of me.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) immediately backs Allisa up, calling it fine, Saoirse agreeing quickly. Allisa tries to be amenable, offering a way to put the party at ease. She raises her staff, the amethyst at its end glowing purple as she casts Disguise Self, taking her elven form. Torbra is taken aback, still uncomfortable at the uncanny effectiveness of the disguise spell.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> My name is [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), and I am the [Aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) of the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) questions if she is the only one, Allisa responding that as far as anyone knows, she is, but she gestures to Thanea and Saoirse, suggesting she knows better. Thanea questions the word "[aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md)", asking what it means. She relates to her the role of her deva, guiding her along a path using dreams, something with Thanea finds familiar, seeing why Allisa thinks they're the same.

Allisa asks [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) what dreams her deva gives her. She replies that they're mostly dreams of the future, in some sort of loosely true form. Those events feel inevitable and involuntary, with her eventually drawn to those events. Allisa relates, her mind racing. She tells Thanea that she also feels like she cannot avoid ending up in the places she sees in her dreams.

Allisa then asks Saoirse, but Saoirse can't relate, explaining that she always gets into trouble in her dreams, but despite that they always seem to help her, thankful of her deva if that is indeed who is giving them to her.

Saoirse mentions her warlock patron [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md), describing as another person "messing with her head".

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I think they're messing with more than your head. When we first met I felt that something was... off. And then in that dream, well that just confirmed it.

Saoirse describes the dream from her perspective as extremely scary, it not making her feel good about herself.

## [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md)

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) tells the party that her deva, [Minsas](../characters/minsas.md), tells her that they want her to convince [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) to come back to [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md) with her. She describes it as being deep in the Kas'ran Desert, the place where her and her deva first spoke.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) questions if her deva speaks to her, Allisa uttering a plain yes. Thanea says that she won't let [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) go alone. Allisa points out how absurd what she mentioned is, stating that they're both in the military and can't just go to the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) due to the [Astor-Syntenne War](../history/events/astor-syntenne-war.md). Saoirse suggests that they might be able to get [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) to make them spies, but Allisa shoots the idea down, stating that they're a different branch of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) military. She stops, telling them that the less they know about them, the safer they'll be.

Thanea mentions the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunters, suggesting that they already know. Allisa dismisses her, revealing that they're called the [Astornos](../organisations/astornos.md).

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> If I were you I'd never mention their name, if you value your lives.

Thanea circles back to point out that the party is in the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) out of necessity, forced into it despite her hatred for the military from a young age. Allisa relates, saying that they are more similar than they realise. She recants efforts to force her into a role she did not want before she chose to join the Veritacris instead.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> So what you're saying is you're not an official spy.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I chose to be a spy so I could see the world and search for another person like myself. If I had done as I was told I'd have been a politician or an arch-mage.

Thanea explains that [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) is currently on a mission and are expected to return to their superiors after, but offers to try and take on a mission that will bring them closer to the Kas'ran Desert, and that she is keen to explore avenues that might further her understanding of both herself and Saoirse.

Allisa ponders if [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md) will bring them the answers they are looking for, suggesting that [Minsas](../characters/minsas.md) may be able to speak to them directly there. She has a gut feeling that answers lie there, particularly after their shared dream. She is unsure if its events are a metaphor or literal events to come, which resonates with Thanea. Saoirse is quick to point out her hope that the events aren't literal due to its negative ending. Thanea disagrees, suggesting that it is an intentional effort to point them to [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md).

## What Are These Creatures?

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) questions what [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) is doing so far from civilisation, and asks about the dead [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) that the party just fought, stating that she's not familiar with them,  asking if they're native wildlife, showing her lack of knowledge.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) retorts that according to their superiors, "your people" made them, recalling [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md)' worst fear of [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) being a creation of the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) for their war effort. Thanea talks of the [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), stating that they are able to turn people into "twisted sand people with blades", then reiterating Elysia's theory.

Allisa sounds confused, suggesting that if they are indeed Syntenne created, they come from a part of her government that doesn't share information with their own spy network.

## The Scourge I Am

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) realises that she needs to further the party's tentative trust in her. She points at [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), calling her trusting for entertaining a [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spy in conversation, and stating that she will endeavour to assuage her doubts.

She backs up slightly before adopting a combat ready stance, repositioning her feet and gripping both her staff and shield firmly while dropping Disguise Self. She takes a large breath, beginning the process of removing her helmet. She knocks her staff against the neck of her helmet, two metal clasps on either side of her collar popping open before she raises her shield and uses its edge to push the helmet from her head, something she is able to do quickly, clearly due to extensive practice.

As soon as her helmet lifts from her head, the party are dazzled by a burst of radiant white-yellow light erupting from her entire body, momentarily preventing them from seeing her properly. After a few moments their vision adjusts, allowing them to make out her form more clearly. Her head and hands are glowing, similar to that of a deva, details too bright to be perceived except for her pointed elven ears and her bald head.

A touch of lingering mist in the immediate vicinity burns off as the long grass around her starts bending in her direction, drawn to the radiance. She hunches over slightly, her entire body clenching from the pain of her burning radiance that she is unable to contain, groaning through gritted teeth with each breath.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> See? Are you happy now tiefling?

She holds her position for a few seconds more before it becomes too much to bear. She drops her staff and shield without thought for them, drops to her knees and begins feeling around for her helmet. She grabs it and begins turning it around, palming it excessively due to being unable to see in such extreme light at close range. Once she orients it she slips it back over her head and fastens down both clips.

The radiant light is still being emitted, streaking through from her eye slits and gaps around the neck, but after a moment it dims quickly, fading until it is lost in the morning light. As it does she starts breathing heavily before dropping to her knees, gasping for air.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) asks if she is okay and wonders what has happened. Allisa grabs her staff and uses it to stand, grabbing her shield as she goes.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> That is my power. I've seen both of yours. We are obviously very different.

Thanea, still concerned, agrees after such a display. Saoirse muses that it didn't look pleasant for Allisa. She agrees but suggests it is worse for those who get "caught in the light".

## The Others' Gifts

Allisa asks [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) about their own powers, calling them gifted.

Torbra tells Allisa that she can enlarge herself. Allisa asks if it was from a spell that was cast before she arrived, but Torbra relates her ability to Allisa's own, a sort of innate gift.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> I've worked with a few genasi, but I've never seen an earth genasi as capable as yourself.

Torbra is surprised, questioning what she just heard. Allisa thinks for a moment, stating that she knows about 20 or so. Torbra says that she has only came across three. Allisa tells her that in the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), being genasi is seen as a rare gift that is celebrated, entitling them to greater social and political standing. Torbra expresses wish to speak more on the topic with Allisa when time allows.

Allisa turns her attention to [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), stating that she isn't familiar with her own gift. Saoirse joins in, accusingly asking her what the deal is with her shifter form.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Yeah! What the fuck's up with that?

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> What's up with what?

Saoirse imitates sharp beast claws, slashing her fingers slightly in the air in front of her.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> None of your business, that's what it is.

Allisa chuckles slightly. Saoirse is sour, saying that it's her loss that she won't be considered cool for sharing.

## What Is Your Mission?

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) brings the conversation back to [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission, asking what their orders are specifically. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) explains that the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) they fought were creatures that were assimilated by [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) from a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). She tells of how [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), once interacted with, begin to overtake that creature.

Allisa reacts by moving further away from the nearby pile of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), the remains of a [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) just killed. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) cuts Thanea off.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Thanea? Maybe we shouldn't be telling them too much? After all, you are a spy.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> As I said, I'm a spy so I can travel and look. Now that I've found, I have no need for such a role.

Thanea expresses her feeling that the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) wouldn't be sad if they all died, so she implies that she has no qualms talking to Allisa. She posits that they were tasked with finding out more about the meteors, so talking to Allisa is a form of investigation (despite disobeying orders to not tell anyone about [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md)). It is clear that she is contorting the truth to suit her own desires.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) speaks up, laying down her feelings:

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Let's be frank here. This thing over here is a spy, from the people who, according to our superiors, made these things. Any information you would give them, they would already know. If they did not make them, then it's useful for them to know.

Thanea reluctantly agrees but doesn't get the point that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is trying to make. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) spells it out - there is no reason not to tell Allisa what they know.

Thanea wonders if these [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) are also falling on the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) and threatening their citizens too. Allisa thinks, recalling occasional [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) over Southern [Kardan](../places/continents/kardan.md), but that natural matters of those kinds falls outside of her areas of expertise.

Allisa asks if she can remain with the party, possibly helping them with their mission if they'll allow it. She states that she would merely like to spend more time with Thanea and Saoirse, hopeful of another chance to see their skills in combat. She then looks to Saoirse specifically.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Maybe I can show you a few things. Some things maybe your deva is pointing you towards.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> It could be interesting, especially if it can make me a little less freaky, I guess. Because let's be honest, the way I am right now is just sad.

Thanea points out that her deva ([Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md)) is the one that sent her to the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) in the first place, so the idea of Allisa joining her on their meteoric mission feels right, stating her firm agreement.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> My deva has made it clear that my early dreams were no accident and were very specifically designed. Now I'm more interested.

## What Are We, Really?

Saoirse asks if all devas have names. Allisa regretfully points out that her deva hasn't told her anything about the pair, but that her deva is called [Minsas](../characters/minsas.md). She states that it was 70 years before hers "had a voice". When Saoirse is shocked at the length of time, Allisa states that she is young for an elf. Saoirse states in shock that she doesn't think she can wait that long.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Well, if we're not actually human...

Allisa considers if Thanea is right, but points out that at any rate, events in her life have progressed rapidly over the last year. Thanea relates, explaining that since arriving in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), her life has been intense and hasn't let up ever since.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> In the last year I've gone to all four corners of this continent.  
> I've spent my life in the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), but  
> I've visited every state in the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md),  
> I've visited every island in the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md),  
> I've visited every icy tundra in the [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md), and  
> I've been slowly visiting every town and city in the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md),  
> but now it's all coming together.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Multiple places I've never heard of. I grew up in the forest.

Saoirse finishes processing Thanea's previous statement, questioning the notion of not being human with disbelief, demanding she elaborates. Allisa steps in, pointing out her darkvision, Healing Hands, and raising her hand towards her full face helmet. She explains that she's not aware of anyone else who has those combined abilities. She suggests that while genasi and [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) are labels used to describe types of gifts, the reality is less understood.

Saoirse relates to the description of darkvision and Healing Hands, but states her belief that Effie gave her those gifts.

## A Distant Disturbance

In the nearby bowl valley of [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md), one of its northern cliff faces that connects it to the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) collapses. The Meteoric Mind's efforts to consume all natural matter in the area and turn it into [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) causes part of the cliff face to give way, no longer strengthened by roots and dirt.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) notices a flash of downwards movement on a distance mountainside as the rock slide begins before most of the party hear an echoing sound of something large, a sound like a large piece of metal being dropped, accompanied by a bassy thud. Torbra is able to recognise it as the sound of something very heavy impacting the ground. Her thoughts are of a large creature nearby. [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) hears it too, questioning what they just heard.
