## Moving On

Still reeling from [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s death, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) suggests the party return to [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md) as they don't have the party strength to complete their mission, not knowing what else might be waiting for them in the [Humar Meteorite Crater](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/humar-meteorite-crater.md). [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) suggests that they could return later now that they know where the crater is. Torbra doubts this, but Thanea has a good understanding of their current location, pointing that it won't be find to find the lake once in the right area.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is still collapsed on the ground sobbing. She suggests getting backup from [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md) before returning to finish the giant crocodile and complete their mission. She begins to get emotional.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Can we... before we go... just stay a little longer?

Thanea and Torbra implore them to move on at least some distance, putting distance between them and the giant crocodile that might decide to attack them again. They take a moment to remember [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) before getting ready to head out.

Saoirse asks Torbra if she can hold [Wizira's Staff](../items/wiziras-staff.md). Torbra gives it to her willingly. She fails to notice anything magical about it.

Torbra instructs the party to head north east, Thanea leading the way, ensuring they are heading in the correct direction. For the rest of the day they march toward [Fort Eldrick](../places/settlements/forts/fort-eldrick.md), [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) following along in a sombre mood, holding hands.

## A Fort in the Distance

By late evening the party begins to see the wall that runs from the [River Carn](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) to [Duskmere](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/duskmere.md) and signs of a fort ([Fort Eldrick](../places/settlements/forts/fort-eldrick.md)) half way along it. They are about 1.5 hours from the wall. Torbra is wary of proceeding any further while it is dark, suggesting the party camps for the night. Thanea assures her that it is likely a fort which won't trouble them, but both agree that camping for the night would be best.

The party sets up their camp for the night. When everyone is finished setting up for bed, Montel comes over to talk to Torbra about what their plan is when they reach the main road ([Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md)). She informs Montel that they plan on returning to [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md), at which point she'll help the pair on their way to [Iredale](../places/settlements/towns/iredale.md) with a letter to [Hjalmann Craggbeard](../characters/hjalmann-craggbeard.md).

Montel tells her that they don't particularly want to go to [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md) but will if that is what it takes. Torbra informs him that their best chance of securing transport north is the capital city.

*[Long rest]*

## Sizing Up the Fort

Under the morning sun the party can see [Fort Eldrick](../places/settlements/forts/fort-eldrick.md) and its wall more clearly, illuminating the fort itself, its central tower, and its box-shaped walled settlement on the other side of the wall. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) recognises the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) flags draped from the tower.

Saoirse asks if the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) will be able to help them. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) notes their prior reputation with the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md), but Saoirse points out their status as [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md). [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) has an exceptionally dim view of the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md), expecting they won't help without specific orders to do so.

Torbra examines the wall from this distance, seeing no way to bypass it and unable to see details of an entrance at the fort. She informs the party that their best bet is to proceed towards the fort.

When she informs Montel of their plan, he is wary of dealing with [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) directly. Torbra recalls the patchwork details of the Leithran family's past in [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md), sensing that dealing with [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) may open old wounds. The party discuss alternatives such as crossing the [River Carn](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) but eventually feel that the fort is still their best bet.

Thanea asks Montel if they are wanted by the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) or are just [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md). Montel is bewildered by the question, telling her that they are neither. Thanea realises that she got the wrong impression from the details of their lives she has learned so far.

Thanea asks Montel if the pair have a way to conceal their ears. Montel ruffles his long hair to cover them before pulling his large hood up and doing the same with Esme's. Thanea finds this too suspicious looking and asks if they have some sort of headband or head wrap that can be used instead. When he informs her that they don't, Saoirse suggests repurposing some spare clothes to create head wraps. A discussion breaks out as to how to make this look natural and not suspicious, the consensus being that everyone will wear one so it looks like a group style choice.

Saoirse takes out her common clothes and works with Thanea who turns them into strips of fabric. Saoirse guides her on how to do this in such a way that the covering will look natural and hide the ears. The pair are able to make four sets, enough for everyone but Torbra, who volunteers to go without.

Now kitted up and with a cover story that they are on official [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) business and are escorting Montel and Esme back to the city, they proceed on to the fort.

## Crossing [Fort Eldrick](../places/settlements/forts/fort-eldrick.md)

After an hour and a half the party arrive at the gatehouse on the southern side of the wall, looking upon its portcullis and large wood and wrought iron doors deeper within. On the wall and gatehouse a series of [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) look down at them.

The lead guard shouts down at the party, asking what their business is. Saoirse shouts that they're on [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) business. When the guard shouts for them to produce badges, the three do so without hesitation. The guard asks for more details of their business, to which Torbra tells them that they are escorting the other two to [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) in [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md).

The guard naturally doesn't know who that is, pressing harder for details. Torbra tells him that their mission is a secret. Torbra backs her up by explaining that it is not in their best interests to shout at guards about secret business.

*[Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md):*
> Fair enough, come on in.

Several [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) begin the slow process of opening the gate, starting with the large inner door. Once it is open [Bevan Lancaster](../characters/bevan-lancaster.md) flanked by two [Astornox Guard Corporals](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-corporal.md) emerges, making their way up to the portcullis. He ushers the party over with his hand. They all approach.

Bevan introduces himself as the [Astornox Captain](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-captain.md) of [Fort Eldrick](../places/settlements/forts/fort-eldrick.md). He asks if the party are just looking to pass through. When Thanea does the formal introductions he comments to himself that she is doing all the talking while the [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) is taking a back seat. He then asks about Esme, noting that they are escorting a child. Thanea tells him that they are on a mission that involves escorting them back to [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md). He is satisfied by the answer.

When Bevan asks if they are just looking to pass through, Thanea tells him that they are looking to be out of the fort's hair as soon as possible. Bevan appreciates the answer before asking them to show him their badges. Everyone does so, causing him to get closer to the portcullis to get a closer look.

*[Bevan Lancaster](../characters/bevan-lancaster.md):*
> They keep getting bigger, don't they?

Satisfied, he waves a hand at the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) on the other side of the gate, causing them to shout orders inside the fort, culminating in the sound of chains moving above before the portcullis begins to slowly rise. While it does he makes idle conversation with the party about the crocodiles on the [Humar Estuary](../places/topography/swamps-deltas/humar-estuary.md) and its weather, passing the time waiting for the heavy apparatus to move.

When the portcullis gets to Torbra's shoulder it stops. Bevan ushers the party under it. They all duck under one by one. Once the last of them is through, Bevan advises them to "watch your toes". Moments later the chains are let go, causing the portcullis to crash back down into place with a thunderous bang. The party isn't fazed.

As they go, Saoirse attempts to provoke one of the guards with a quip:

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Hey remember, stick 'em with the pointy end.

The guard she is talking to keeps his tight lipped demeanour and shakes his head at her slowly, while the guard behind him stifles a chuckle.

[Bevan Lancaster](../characters/bevan-lancaster.md) and his guards closely escort the party through [Fort Eldrick](../places/settlements/forts/fort-eldrick.md), taking them to the identical gatehouse on the north side, an identical procedure taking place in reverse to let them out of the other side. The party clears the fort without incident.

Back on the road, the party soon find the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) and follow it east, eventually turning off after crossing the [River Humar](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md). By nightfall they reach the [Sunrise District](../places/settlements/districts/sunrise-district.md) of [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md).

## Attempting to Enter the Wall

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) leads the party toward the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md), intent on taking the party including [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) to [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/government/tenterfell-house.md) to see [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md). Reaching the closest gatehouse, Torbra finds the usual gatehouse checks for [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md). [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) makes sure her badge is on display while Torbra makes sure her halberd is.

After waiting for a moment for their turn, the [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) running the gatehouse begins to point the members of [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) in one by one, seeing their badges clearly. When Montel, holding Esme's hand, is next in line, the guard stops him, declaring that he isn't allowed to enter. Saoirse immediately tells the guard that it is okay because they are with their squad, but the guard isn't having any of it - he sternly tells her that unless they have [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md) or are being escorted by a military officer, they're not entering the [Sunset District](../places/settlements/districts/sunset-district.md).

Saoirse threatens the guard by telling him that she will get Elysia and he will be in trouble. He begins to chuckle. She asks him if he knows who she is, but he is quick to retort:

*[Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md):*
> No I don't, which is exactly why you're not getting in with this person. We have very specific orders: no badge, no entry.

Saoirse begins to question the rules but the guard stands firm to his orders. Saoirse suggests Torbra goes to fetch Elysia while the rest wait outside the gatehouse, also telling her specifically to tell Elysia to tell this guard off when she returns, "even if it's for bullshit reasons".

## Fetching Elysia

Torbra heads directly to [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/government/tenterfell-house.md). On arrival she asks at the front desk if Elysia is in. Finding that she is, she heads up to the third floor where she finds [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) sat at her desk writing in a journal. She looks up at Torbra to confirm who she is before going back to her writing.

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> Ah, you're back. You're late.

Torbra alludes to some complications before asking if Elysia will accompany her outside so she can be seen rather than shown what they are. She closes her book, immediately regretting closing it so soon after applying wet ink to it.

Torbra tells Elysia that there is good and bad news. Elysia asks her to lead with the bad news. Torbra informs her of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s death, telling her that they lost her and not in her usual playful way.

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> Shit.

Torbra continues to list the outcomes of the mission. She explains that one positive is they discovered the [Humar Meteorite Crater](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/humar-meteorite-crater.md) and will be able to return to it for further study. Elysia is dismissive, pointing out that they were able to re-find a lake that had already been found by [Astral Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) once before. She hopes that Torbra has more. When Torbra alludes to more not being strictly related to their mission, Elysia expresses her pessimism that this sounds like more bad news.

Torbra takes Elysia to the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) gatehouse. By the time the pair arrive Elysia is visibly grumpy at the entire situation. She welcomes [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) back before looking at Torbra expectantly. Torbra introduces [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md), telling Elysia that they found the pair out on the [Humar Estuary](../places/topography/swamps-deltas/humar-estuary.md) and that they helped them toward the crater. Elysia greets them formally including a lean and a smile down to Esme, but Esme is full of nerves and apprehension about the city, guards, and most viscerally, the orange tiefling with all-black eyes looming over her. She buries her face into Montel's leg.

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> Um... h-h-he-hello.

Faced by this unlikely pair and unamused by Torbra, she shoots a dirty look at Torbra before prompting her for more details. Torbra explains that Esme is "like me" (Earth Genasi) and they wish to take care of them until they can move on to a better home. Saoirse asks Elysia to grant them safe passage.

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md), to [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> Well aren't you a saint.

Elysia gets 1 gp from her coin pouch and forces it on Montel before pointing him down the first side alley towards a nearby inn ([Lionel's Rest](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/lionels-rest.md)), telling them to stay there for the night. She then turns to the party and tells them to return with her as they have "business to sort out". Torbra apologises to Montel and tells him that they'll catch up later. Montel looks visibly scared by their current situation, particularly in the presence of [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) officers. He turns around and proceeds away as soon as possible.

Torbra sarcastically quips at Elysia that she is wonderful with kids but Elysia ignores her. The party return to [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/government/tenterfell-house.md) with her.

## Mission Debrief

[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) opens the door to her third floor room, letting the whole party in before closing it behind them. She goes back to her desk and sits down, sighing audibly.

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md)*:
> I put a lot of faith in you guys. I know this was only your first mission but it doesn't sound like it's gone too well. I mean for starters there's only three of you, which is... unfortunate.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) doesn't like Elysia calling [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s death unfortunate, but Elysia explains that it isn't too rare for [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) to die on missions. Elysia goes on to explain that their mission failure isn't a terribly big deal, except for their dealings with [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) which to her look like distractions from their mission.

Saoirse tries to explain that the squad found them on the [Humar Estuary](../places/topography/swamps-deltas/humar-estuary.md), in need of help, but Elysia shuts her down, angrily telling her that there was no need to bring them to her as they aren't her problem and have nothing to do with her or the meteoric threat.

Saoirse retorts that they are helping them because they are good people, and that the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) should have similar values. Elysia provides a blunt assessment of the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s values and their mission:

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> We do have values, it's get your fucking mission done, and look after nature, and make sure the world's not being destroyed by [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) or whatever is going on.
>
> We're talking about bigger things here than two people.  
> How many bodies did you see in that cave again?

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Too many.

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> Because I'm sure if we don't figure this out, it'll be more.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) gets the debrief back on track, explaining that they found the [Humar Meteorite Crater](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/humar-meteorite-crater.md), but it contained a giant crocodile that was able to kill [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). A clear look of shock and frustration washes over Elysia's face as she closes her eyes and scrunches up her mouth.

Saoirse explains that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) had been tracking a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) before meeting her untimely end. This gets Elysia's attention, checking through notes written in one of her books, finding some notes on what magic [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) possesses. Elysia recognises that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) cast Locate Object, causing her to ask what [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) was searching for. Saoirse explains that it was [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md).

Elysia mutters under her breath that [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md) is going to kill her.

Saoirse tells Elysia that the lake isn't a lake, it's a crater, casting Minor Illusion to create a close representation of the lake and its surrounding terrain in her hand. Elysia tells the party that this was the place they found, though the crater contained significantly less water. Torbra questions that if [Astral Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) knew it was a crater, why they didn't explore it. Elysia tells her that this was the first sign of the meteoric threat that her squad had found, so beyond the shards of the [Humar Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md) they had no cause to look further, continuing on with their [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission. Elysia offered [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s mission as a means of checking that they hadn't missed other clues.

Thanea suggests that the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) was likely there when [Astral Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) visited the crater, and now the crocodile had become attached to it, much in the same way that [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) did with the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md). Torbra puts forward her theory that attachment to the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) causes creatures to change, explaining the crocodile's giant proportions. That could mean that the crocodile is even larger on his return, or that there are other large animals out in the world due to [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md).

Saoirse immediately finds flaws in the theory, noting that Slaine didn't get any bigger. Torbra retorts that he did get more deadly. Elysia asks about the appearance of the giant crocodile, drawing the party's attention to the fact that unlike the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) and the [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md), the giant crocodile wasn't covered in or made of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). Torbra suggests that the crocodile could have eaten other [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) shards like the ones [Astral Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) found.

Saoirse suggests that they will be able to get answers when they go back. Torbra suggests they can't take the giant crocodile on with only three squad members. Elysia tells them that she will have to report the mission details and outcome to Quinn in the morning, cautioning the party that they may not get a chance to go back and may even be reassigned from Phenomena / Meteoric.

She is optimistic that the limited information the party have provided her will go some way to appeasing Quinn. She also states that she will look to get a new fourth [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) for [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) so that they have the firepower, and because [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads typically have four members.

[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) orders [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) to take two days of downtime before reporting back to her to see what the outcomes of her meeting with Quinn are.

## Passing on Post

[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) tells the party there is one more thing for them before they go. She begins searching in her drawers and on her desk for three letters addressed to party members that arrived while they were out on their mission. As she searches she knocks papers from her desk surface, causing her to curse in infernal under her breath. Eventually she finds what she is looking for.

She passes two letters to [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md), one in a fancy envelope with a grey [Astornar](../organisations/government/astornar.md) wax seal and a fully formed military address ([L-PR-06](../letters/L-PR-06.md)), the other in a drab envelope with only Thanea's name and city written on it ([L-PR-05](../letters/L-PR-05.md)). Elysia then wordlessly hands the third envelope to [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) ([L-PR-04](../letters/L-PR-04.md)), having seen [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s name on the front.

When Torbra asks who the letters are from she explains that the sealed envelope looks important, but the other she has no opinions about. Torbra flips over the envelope, seeing it is addressed to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), muttering "well shit" to herself. Thanea tucks her letters away, intent on reading them while alone.

Saoirse asks Elysia if she knows where she can find a book about riddles, explaining that she wishes to take her mind off of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s death with it. Elysia unhelpfully notes that there are many libraries in [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md) - one will surely have such a book. When Saoirse asks where the closest one is, she points out there is one in the stronghold ([Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/government/hawks-perch.md)). Saoirse chastises Elysia for not giving them a tour of the stronghold, but Elysia points out that this is precisely why they have time between missions.

As everyone begins filing out of the room to attend to their errands, Torbra goes over to Elysia and passes her a gold coin, telling her that it is to repay her for Montel and Esme's accommodation. Elysia thanks her.

Moments after closing the door behind them, most of the party hear Elysia sweeping the entire contents of her desktop onto the floor out of frustration.

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> Well apparently our horny lesbian is also a drama queen.

## Torbra Visits Montel and Esme

Torbra makes her way back to the [Sunrise District](../places/settlements/districts/sunrise-district.md), finding [Lionel's Rest](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/lionels-rest.md) where she knows [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) are staying. She uses her [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) badge to persuade the innkeeper to tell her which room they are staying in.

She knocks on the door, getting no answer until she talks through the door, explaining who she is. Montel, looking very tired, invites her inside.

Torbra apologises for what happened, telling Montel that she didn't expect Elysia's poor reaction. Montel thanks her for trying but informs her that the pair will be leaving in the morning for [Iredale](../places/settlements/towns/iredale.md). Torbra once again offers to write a letter to [Hjalmann Craggbeard](../characters/hjalmann-craggbeard.md), which Montel accepts.

While Torbra is rummaging through her bag for writing supplies, Esme, who now appears to be less scared and apprehensive of the city, comes over to Torbra and begins talking to her. She asks where they are, Torbra telling her that this is [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md), though they will be leaving soon. Esme asks if Torbra will be coming with them, but Torbra tells her that she can't, but she will come to visit her whenever she can. Torbra tells her that [Iredale](../places/settlements/towns/iredale.md) is where she grew up. Esme thinks this means she will be staying in Torbra's house but Torbra corrects her. Esme asks if Torbra's family is as tall as she is, to which she says no.

Content with the answers given, Esme goes back to playing in the other corner of the room while Torbra writes.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) writes a letter to [Hjalmann Craggbeard](../characters/hjalmann-craggbeard.md). It contains some information about how Torbra is doing and her role in the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md), well wishes to him and his family, and then information about Montel and Esme's need for a home in the town, with hopes that they will be welcomed. Torbra doesn't mention the Leithran family's troubles in [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md) but does point out that they are elves, imploring them to treat them the same as anyone else, calling them good people. She also alludes to Esme being "similar to me". Torbra leaves an address to [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/government/tenterfell-house.md) for future correspondence.

When Torbra hands the letter to Montel, he reads it through, tears welling up in his eyes as he reads what she wrote about their character. Once again Montel thanks her profusely for everything the squad did for her, telling her that he hopes that life in [Iredale](../places/settlements/towns/iredale.md) goes well for them. Torbra wishes them well, advising them to be careful on the roads. Montel produces 6 sp, chuckling that the gold coin was too much for their inn stay, and so they will be able to afford transport.

Seeing the silver, Torbra gives 5 gp to Montel. As soon as she pulls out gold coins from her purse, Montel begins to cry uncontrollably.

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> You don't know when to stop being kind, do you?

Torbra tells him that he wants them to have a good life and wants to see them when she visits her family next. She hopes that the money will help with their journey and setting up their life once in [Iredale](../places/settlements/towns/iredale.md). Her thanks her again before the pair embrace in a goodbye hug, in which she tells them to take care. Esme comes over and reaches up to Torbra with both arms for a hug of her own. She picks her up.

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> It was nice seeing you Esme. You're going to go on to your new home tomorrow. I'll come and visit you when I've got time, but make sure you grow up and be a good girl, alright?

Esme says okay, clearly not taking the goodbye as if she won't be able to see Torbra tomorrow. Torbra says a final goodbye before leaving.

## Thanea Reads Her Letters

After finding a private spot alone, [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) starts to open her letters.

She starts with the plain looking letter ([L-PR-05](../letters/L-PR-05.md)), finding a letter from her brother to be completely unexpected.

She then opens the fancier looking letter ([L-PR-06](../letters/L-PR-06.md)), noting the grey [Astornar](../organisations/government/astornar.md) seal before breaking it. She recognises [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md) by name and title as General Supreme, her stomach dropping as she realises that he is the ruler of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), realising this isn't an invite that she can decline.

Thanea is confused by the paragraph about using the letter to accept the invite, but inferring that the mention of her being [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) means that her attendance is achieved through magical means. As she examines it more closely she can feel a slight static tingle across the surface of the letter, indicating it may be magical itself.

Thinking that she needs to use the letter to accept the invite, she vocalises her acceptance while holding the letter. Rather than an acknowledgement of her future attendance, she is teleported into the [Tower of Ast](../places/buildings/government/tower-of-ast.md) in an instant.

## Searching the Library

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) goes looking for [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) to show her to the library within the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/settlements/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), but is unable to find her. Feeling stood up, Saoirse goes to look for someone else, eventually bumping back into [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md). Torbra doesn't know where Thanea is either, though neither see her disappearance as problematic. They proceed to the [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/government/hawks-perch.md) together.

Once there they head to the [Astorrel member](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) behind the counter to ask for what they are searching for. Saoirse asks her for any and all books concerning riddles. The member can't recall specific riddle books, but points Saoirse over to the theology section that includes books on topics such as rhetorical arguments. Asking the librarian if she likes riddles herself, the librarian is extremely dismissive, telling Saoirse she "prefers matters of truth".

Saoirse struggles to research in the library setting (natural 1), failing to find anything with the last hour before the library closes for the night.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) searches the library for the word "genasi", now having a word for her elemental lineage. She starts with [Humanoids and Rare Varieties](../items/books/humanoids-and-rare-varieties.md), drawn back to it after her previous visit. Within she revisits much of the 5th volume's contents, rediscovering the story of [Simanelli Tyrol](../characters/simanelli-tyrol.md). With her newfound context she realises that they were most likely a water genasi. This revelation takes her the hour to make.

Both Saoirse and Torbra leave the library as it is closing.
