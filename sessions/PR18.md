## Seeking [Sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md)

As the party arrives into the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), they are stopped by the 2 [Astorrel Guards](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) guarding the gatehouse. [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) speaks to the [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md), [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md), declaring that the party is here seeking [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

*[Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md):*

> Understood.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) congratulates Torbra on mooning the [Astornox Guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) as they reached the stronghold. Garrick and Sparrow make their way through the gatehouse, the party following behind.

Garrick turns to his left towards [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), unlocking the door with his key and proceeding inside, lighting the candles within and inviting the party within. He tells Sparrow that he can come with or leave, his choice. Sparrow wordlessly asks the party to decide - [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) pleads for him to stay. They all proceed inside.

On the ground floor, Garrick continues to light the candles in sconces attached to the walls. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) attempts to use Druidcraft to aid with lighting the candles, but the anti-magic field enveloping the building prevents any effect. She then tries to cast Produce Flame to see if fire will form in her hand, but once again there is no effect. Garrick sees her doing this, stopping what he is doing and smirking at her. He chuckles before explaining that what she is trying won't work in here, and that it is for everyone's protection.

Two more [Astornox Guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) who were stationed on the inside of the gatehouse have followed the party into [the Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) from behind, poking their heads in the door. Garrick sees them enter and gives them orders:

*[Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md):*

> Graf, declare the offer. Sesen, go find a member.

With that the guards acknowledge their orders and leave the room, Graf breaking into a run as he rushes to find other [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) to cover the gatehouse until the next guard shift can cover Garrick's guard's duties.

Torbra is hesitant, feeling that they have stepped out of a bad situation and into another. Sparrow asks if the party knows anything about [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), to which Torbra responds that she has no idea. Sparrow gets Garrick to introduce himself by name before asking that he presents his offer and explains the process.

He explains how the party will be under his protection, he will answer to no one, not even the [Astorrel Commandant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md), that he must sit outside of their [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) 24/7 while he offers [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), and that when he has had enough of doing so the party will be lead back out of the stronghold and into [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md).

He asks them why they seek [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) explains that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are mad at them for being [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), and that they are only into this mess because of one of the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md). Garrick asks the party if they know his rank, but they don't. Garrick finds their reason for seeking [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) satisfactory, and is candid with them that being [magicborn on the run](../storylines/magicborn-on-the-run.md) is a common reason to seek it. He explains that most who seek it don't make it this far, and thus they have his respect. Torbra laments that they only got here by leaving a trail of bodies. Garrick is quick to point out that he witnessed the fight on [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street with his own eyes. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) defends their actions by pointing out that they attacked out of self defence. He is dismissive of this, explaining that the commandant ([Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md)) will concern themself with this.

[Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) offers his terms of [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) to the party:

- The party will have quarters ([sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md)) upstairs in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md).
- They will sleep there, and food & drink will be brought to them twice a day.
- They may stay as long as they wish, and are free to leave early at their discretion.
- The offer is typically time limited - when Garrick has had enough, the offer will be rescinded.
- For safety reasons the party will be locked inside their quarters and will not have freedom of movement.
- There will be visitors who Garrick is able to allow into their quarters.
- The party may make requests of Garrick, who is amenable to helping them with reasonable ones.
- The party must deposit all their belongings in the chests provided on the ground floor, which will be locked away.
- The party must change into [Astorrel robes](../organisations/astorrel/uniforms/astorrel-robes.md) ([sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) variant) while in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).
- The party may take one possession in each, but Garrick will inspect it and must approve it first.

Graf returns in the doorway, out of breath. He relays to Garrick that the gatehouse is manned and they're just waiting for the next guard shift to wake up and get into position. Garrick is satisfied that his guard's duties are proceeding well. He asks him to give the party a hand as they change and store their possessions.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) brings up [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) to Garrick, explaining that he was captured by the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and is supposedly on his way to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) for conscription. He reassures her that Levelle will be told about this, and they will likely come and visit the party by morning. He asks them to raise this issue with them.

Sesen returns with an [Astorrel Member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) who heads behind the desk, pulls out a large book, and gets a quill & ink ready for writing. She busies herself with recording details about the offer of [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

The party goes about taking their possessions and placing them in the chests. Garrick goes into the locked room on the ground floor, returning with 4 [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) [Astorrel robes](../organisations/astorrel/uniforms/astorrel-robes.md), handing them to each person. One by one they go to the changing stalls at the back and change into them.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) asks where they should place the items they wish to keep. Garrick asks them to place the items on the counter so he can inspect them. When Torbra isn't sure what to take, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) says that she can take one of her things, to which Garrick interrupts and insists she can't. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) successfully persuades him that they share their possessions, resulting in Garrick altering his rule, allowing them to take 4 possession into [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) with them from amongst their possessions.

| Possession | Character | Garrick's Observations | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bagpipes | [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) | Pressed to check for contents. Hesitant. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) warned about playing loudly. | Allowed. |
| [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) | [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) | Unwrapped from cloth. Unsure what it is. Torbra convinces Garrick it is merely a rock. | Allowed. |
| Pouch of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) | [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) | Unsure what it is. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) explains it is drugs. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) explains it is a rare herbalist ingredient. | Disallowed. Thrown into [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md)'s chest. |

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) is unhappy that they are not allowed to take the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) in with them, warning Garrick not to lose it. He assures [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) that it will be safe, as the chests will be locked and placed in a locked room.

## Entering [Sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md)

[Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) leads the party upstairs to the first floor and over to the entrance to their [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), seeing the bell and chain hanging from the corner of the recess in the corridor, instinctively goes over to it and pulls on the chain, causing the bell to ring. She hears the connected bell inside the [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) ringing but isn't able to fully comprehend it, believing the bell to echo strangely.

Garrick opens up the [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), showing the party that in order to pass through the first door they must stand in the corner of the corridor and close the first door. After unlocking the second, he returns.

He explains to the party some of the features of their [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md):

- Living area with a soft floor and coffee table.
- Bathroom.
- Storage room with futons and bedding.
- Bell system of two connected bells, one inside and one outside.
  - Ringing their bell will cause Garrick to enter the room and help them.
  - Garrick will ring the bell when visitors are about to enter.

Garrick explains that he has final say over who is allowed in to visit. He looks at [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) and tells him that he is not allowed. Sparrow nods acceptingly, looking disappointed but not surprised.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) expresses bemusement that the party are being told to resolve their situation while in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), but they have no idea how to do that. Garrick advises the party to rest after what must have been a hard day and he will see to it that the right people come to visit over the coming days.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) asks if there are facilities for washing, to which Garrick reiterates that there is a bathtub. Not presuming their level of familiarity with modern plumbing, he offers to come in and show them how the bathroom works if need be.

One by one the party makes their way through the double-door airlock into their [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) quarters. The sound of both sets of doors locking behind them can be heard quite clearly, followed by muffled conversations through the slightly thin wall as Garrick instructs his guards on errands he needs them to run, before they can be head heading downstairs to leave.

The party start familiarising themselves with their [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). Torbra opens the cupboard discovering the futons stored within. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tries to figure out where to defecate. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) explains how the taps work but isn't sure herself. They ring the bell to summon Garrick who explains to them how to use the sink, bathtub and toilet. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) goes to the toilet with the door open.

## Visitor: [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md)

As the party is washing up and getting ready to bed down for the night, the bell rings, indicating a visitor. After a few moments the door opens and [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) steps into the room. Immediately she locks eyes on [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) sat on the floor by the coffee table, the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor in her lap.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) attempts to cast Detect Thoughts, but to no effect due to the anti-magic field that remains present throughout [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md).

Elysia is flabbergasted at the sight of a meteor, expressing disbelief to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md). She defends herself, telling her that she was allowed to keep one possession. Elysia asks if she knows what it is. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) does. Elysia demands that she tells her what it is. As [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) hesitates, she shouts:

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*

> It's a fucking [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md)!

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) agrees. Elysia is impressed. She introduces herself before telling the party that she heard about what happened to [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md), off-handedly placing the blame for him on herself. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) calls her a "horny lesbian" under her breath which Elysia hears, and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) & Torbra snicker at.

Elysia's demeanour changes. She explains that they need to have a chat, sitting down at the coffee table and attempting to reset the conversation. She cautions the party that the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) shouldn't be seen by anyone else, then introduces herself as the [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) for [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md)'s squad. She dismisses Wrenn immediately, declaring her interest in the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) rather than his predicament.

Elysia explains that [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) have been trying to get their hands on a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) for 6 months. Torbra and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) are flippant about the ease in which they came into possessing the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). Elysia explains that [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) has been working to learn more about these strange [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) since the winter, listing off their experiences to date:

| [Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) | Location | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Humar Estuary [Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) | Humar Estuary | Crater only. |
| [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) [Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) | [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) (not named) | Rumours of creatures eating the livestock, missing people. Sent some people there but gained no useful information. They returned a piece of the meteor to Elysia. |

Elysia admits that they don't know what they're dealing with, but the meteors scare her shitless. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) immediately agrees, sharing in her concern, explaining the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) that they fought in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md). Elysia asks if they fought them, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) saying yes. Elysia asks how dangerous they were, to which the party is dismissive of them due to their more dangerous encounter with [Morog Whiteknuckle](../characters/morog-whiteknuckle.md) and [The Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md).

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) explains that the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) appear to be made of the same material as the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), and that they have a pouch of it locked up downstairs. Elysia swears, demanding more details of its location, impressing upon the party the risk that someone might discover it. She tells the party that she brought lock picks with her, implying that she will try to retrieve the pouch.

Elysia explains that what [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) know of [the meteoric threat](../storylines/the-meteoric-threat.md) isn't common knowledge and that she'd like to keep it that way. She implores the group to hide the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) and not speak of it or their experiences to anyone else while here. In return she will try to help them with their situation after speaking to the rest of her squad. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) explains that [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) inspected the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) but was convinced that it is merely a rock. Elysia tells them to keep it that way.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) makes it clear that she will be keeping the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) until she knows that [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) is safe. Elysia coldly suggests that she can always not help the party and retrieve it from their corpses when the offer of [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) is rescinded and they wind up dead on the streets of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) puts her hand on [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md)'s shoulder, shaking her head and attempting to de-escalate.

Before she leaves, Elysia requests more specifics from [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) of the pouch of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) lies to her, insisting she doesn't know which chest it was placed in. Elysia sighs, explaining that it is too much of a risk staying in a chest, so she will come back when it is quieter to try and retrieve it.

Torbra asks what the risk is if the pouch is found. Elysia explains that her squad are worried that [the meteoric threat](../storylines/the-meteoric-threat.md) is a concerted effort to do harm, with one possibility being the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) possessing an unknown form of magic which is causing the meteors. That would in turn mean the end of the Astor-Syntenne War's armistice and a resumption of open warfare. Elysia is worried that if what they know gets out to the general public, there may be a mass panic. As a result they've been trying to gather evidence before taking the matter higher up the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) chain of command.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) asks why Elysia doesn't care about [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md). Elysia plainly calls him an idiot. She explains that she sent him to investigate the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) after having previously sent him to Carnmere, from which he returned empty handed. She concedes that his failures don't reflect well on her, and his disappearance will bring questions to her that she's going to find hard to answer while also trying to hide the truth of what they've been up to.

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*

> It's a bit annoying, but I can't say I miss the fucker.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) gives Wrenn some credit, explaining that without him the party wouldn't be here with the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). She is thankful that Wrenn was at least able to do that right. She hopes he shows up, at least because if not Elysia expects [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) will be sent after him.

Before leaving she hints that the [Astorrel Commandant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md) and [Astorrel Captain](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-captain.md) will likely be visiting soon, indicating that the commandant isn't exactly a barrel of laughs.

After she leaves, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) tells the group that she knows of Elysia because of what she learned from reading Wrenn's mind, and suggests that she is a person they can most likely trust. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) doesn't like her. Torbra agrees that they should hide the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) hides it in the closet where the futons are stored.

The party beds down for the night.

## [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) Patron Chat 1

As everyone is going to sleep, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) goes into the bathroom and closes the door. She drapes a towel over the oil burning light's glass container, darkening the room. She runs a bath and gets into the bathtub before calling out to Effie Silttooth, telling her that she's lonely, misses her, wishes that they could spend some time together, as well as the adventures & dreams that she's experienced lately.

There is a long period where there is no response before the light in the room goes out completely, and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) hears her patron's voice:

*Effie Silttooth:*

> You accepted their help. How could you!?

*[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) ó Dochartaigh:*

> Whose help?

Immediately the light comes back on and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) is left wondering what her patron meant. She finishes her bath and goes to bed.

*[Long rest]*

## The Following Morning

### 08:00

In the morning the party is woken up by the sunlight entering the room through the windows, and then the sound of the bell ringing.

| Character | Action |
| --- | --- |
| [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) | Woke up early to prepare spells for the day ahead. |
| [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) | Was sleeping cuddling the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), but manages to hide it in the cupboard before anyone enters the room. |
| [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) | Pulls the blanket back over her and sleeps in. |

Garrick enters the room, looking quite tired. He informs the group that a breakfast of bacon and eggs is on the way and then they have a visitor. He advises them to tidy up beforehand. Torbra throws all of the bedding in the cupboard. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) then also tries to fit the coffee table into the cupboard, causing a minor rip in one of the futons, but managing to squeeze everything in between closing the door. As the guards bring breakfast in on trays, they are confused at the lack of a table, instead setting the food, pitcher of water, and mugs on the floor.

Torbra decides it would be better to have a table to eat on, so she retrieves it from the cupboard, making a mess in the process but shoving the bedding back into the cupboard. The party eats their breakfast.

## Visitor: [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md)

### 08:30

As the party is finishing the last bites of their breakfast, the bell rings and into the room steps [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md).

They are immediately judgmental, declaring that these are the troublemakers killing [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) on the stronghold's doorstep. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) immediately retorts that they were defending themselves. They sit down and introduce themselves.

Levelle is here because of that morning's reports of [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) killed by the party as they made their way to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), noting the headache that it is causing them. They are also curious what brings them here.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) plainly states that it is her father. Levelle pieces together that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is the blue firbolg, asking her name, which [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) gives freely. Levelle explains the basics of [the firbolg controversy](../storylines/the-firbolg-controversy.md) between the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and asks for details of her situation. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) explains that she came home to find her father missing, and that [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) helped her understand that he had been taken for conscription by the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). Levelle finds [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) well informed on the controversy.

Levelle suggests that there are other instances of issues between firbolg clans and the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), noting in particular recent troubles in the [Mocker Swamp](../places/forests/mocker-swamp.md). They note that it is refreshingly welcome to meet first-hand a firbolg having troubles, asking for more specifics that may prove useful. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) explains that [Wizira's father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) kept away from [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) entirely, not interacting with the society of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) at all. She impresses upon Levelle that he would not have gone willingly.

Levelle states that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) believes all firbolg are [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), hence why he may have been taken. She doesn't know if this is true of the race. They ask the rest of the party what their involvement was with [Wizira's father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) disappearance. The party explains that they arrived after the fact, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) once again mentioning [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md). Levelle does not recognise the name, but the party explains that he is [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). When Levelle asks for his rank, they are unsure, but Torbra tells them that Wrenn is in [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md). Levelle states that they will look into who Wrenn is. 

The party mentions they crossed paths with [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) whose name Levelle recognises, believing them to work with the Major of Urban Expansion.

Levelle explains that the party have left them with quite the mess to clean up as there are delicate relations between the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) at present. They suggest that the party has given the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) a huge reason to knock at their door demanding blood. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) retorts that it was [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) that shot first, signalling the danger they were in and prompting them to join him in combat.

Levelle's demeanour becomes more serious. They demand his name, which [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) provides. She explains that he'd be dead if not for her help getting him back up and into the stronghold. Levelle makes it clear that they will be "having a word" with Sparrow.

Levelle informs the party that they managed to kill an [Astornox Magicborn Hunter](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md) ([Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md)), congratulating them as they do not go down easily. They plainly explain that as a result of this they will likely be killed the moment they step foot outside of the stronghold.

Levelle also informs the party that an [Astornox guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) was killed on [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street, and another in the sewers under the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md).

> Must have slipped. I'm sure it's quite slippery down there, anything could happen.

With that, Levelle explains that they have business to attend to following what they have learned from the conversation. They sternly inform the group that this won't be the last time they meet, and to try not to kill any of the [Astorrel guards](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md), annoyed to even have to warn them of this. They leave in a hurry.

After [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) leaves, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) says how surprised she is that Levelle wasn't thankful that the party helped save one of them. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) suggests that if [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) Hunters are supposed to be the best of the best, Vilnia didn't deserve their rank anyway. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) explains that she tried to put the second hunter ([Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md)) down but he kept getting back up.
