## The Skeletons Awaken

[Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) continue their fight against the short bow wielding skeletons that have animated within the first chamber of [Devdaha Crypt](../places/structures/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md), the archer trial.

*[Initiative order resumes]*

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) emerges from the raised area on the right hand side of the room behind the pillars, standing on the staircase between the central pair. She throws a Star Mote (Produce Flame) at the skeleton on the stairs opposite, settings its robes on fire and causing it to fall apart. Still with Starry Form: Archer active, she fires a spectral arrow at the skeleton behind, but it ducks under the shot.

The skeletons on the opposite side of the room stand, many having fallen when they descended quickly from the raised section on the other side of the room. They emerge from between the pillars, six shooting their short bows at [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md), targeting her due to her being the source of the Channel Divinity: Turn the Undead that wiped out half of the skeletons in the room. She deflects most of the arrows with her shield and heavy armour, but two manage to penetrate softer spots. The skeleton that [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) is engaged with in the corner at the back right hand side of the room pulls out a shortsword and attempts to stab her but misses.

Ahsha retaliates with her greataxe, disconnecting one of its arms and collar bone with a heavy swing. She follows it up by kicking it into the wall, it scattering across the stony surface as it impacts. She then slides down to the central lower section and tries to push past Korina, clumsily making her way around her.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) pops out from behind a pillar on the right side of the room, hurling Eldritch blast at the skeleton not far below. One blast hits critically, the combined force blasting the skeleton into pieces that fly in all directions. Its head flies backwards, impacting the skeleton behind it, knocking several of its ribs off. Noon retreats back behind the same pillar.

Korina casts Cure Wounds on herself to take some of the sting from the arrows out of her. She swings around Ahsha, placing herself at the bottom of the stairs. Ephaine, seeing Korina block the staircase, dips out from behind a pillar to cast Star Mote (Produce Flame) at a skeleton across the room, setting its bow on fire as it impacts its body. She follows it up with a spectral arrow which finishes it off.

The five remaining skeletons shoot Korina with arrows, three hitting (one critically). One arrow catches her in the neck, knocking her unconscious as she collapses to the ground, losing concentration on Shield of Faith that was cast on Noon.

Seeing Korina drop to the ground, Ahsha charges towards the closest skeleton, trying to attract the skeletons' attention. She hacks it down in one well placed hit before moving on to the next closest, repeating the feat, a second crumbling into a bile of bones before her.

Noon once again pops out from behind the pillar, blasting the remaining skeleton on his visible side of the room, finishing it off with the single blast that connected with it. He daintily lowers himself down the ledge and into the middle of the room, moving over towards Korina in her defence.

Ephaine rushes over to Korina, placing a hand upon her and casting Cure Wounds, bringing her back to consciousness.

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> Hey hun, stay down, I don't think they know you're back.

She steps around Korina, getting line of sight on the two remaining skeletons in the corner of the central area. She shoots a spectral arrow into the skeleton at the back. It retaliates but misses. The skeleton in front of Ahsha tries to fire at her, but she grabs the arrow from its short bow, snapping it in half, telling it "no". She crashes down on it with her greataxe, cutting right through its short bow as it tries in vain to defend itself. Ahsha moves up to the last skeleton, trying to swing hard at it, but her greataxe catches the side of the wall, causing her to miss.

Noon moves up to see the last skeleton, casting Eldritch Blast and hitting it with both blasts. Ahsha sizes up another hit on the skeleton as the force energy whizzes past her, the skeleton's bones scattering across the wall and raised area behind it. The room falls silent.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## The Archer Trial

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) offers to help [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) to her feet but she gets herself up. Ephaine suggests taking a rest before moving on, [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) agreeing readily. They collectively wonder whether to investigate the body in the middle of the room that has been present since their arrival, concerned that it might reanimate itself at some point. Ephaine suggests keeping an eye on their surroundings just in case.

Ephaine apologises to the group for roping them into such a dangerous place, not sure exactly what's going on. The party responds positively, happy to help her out here with exploring.

Ephaine and Ahsha find a spot in one of the upper areas to keep an eye out over the area. Ahsha gathers finger bones from the skeleton and uses her time to make a necklace from them.

About 5 minutes into their break, Ephaine's Starry Form ends. As it does the door on the far side of this room raises back up from the ground at speed, slamming shut.

*[Everyone: short rest]*

Ahsha encourages the party to investigate the mysterious body. Ephaine cautions that it could be dangerous. Ahsha attaches a femur to her greataxe handle, using it to attempt to lift the cape draped over it, but can't get it to move much. Noon casts Mage Hand to lift the cape up entirely, placing it to one side. The party observes a long dead skeleton covered in decaying cloth fineries and leather straps with buckles. A blade around the size of a shortsword or dagger ([Grievous Weapon](../items/magic/enchantments/grievous-weapon.md): Dagger) can be seen under the skeleton at its side, as well as a collection of coins strewn near the waist, spilled from a frayed coin purse that has decayed.

Ahsha uses her axe to scrape the coins across the floor away from the body so that she can pick them up without risking touching the body. She finds four silvery coins ([Chausain platinum coins](../items/coins/chausain-platinum-coin.md)). Ephaine ritual casts Augury, consulting her star chart for omens concerning touching the body (weal and woe). She is unsure of the guidance she has received, expressing hesitation.

Ephaine leans down to the body, caressing the skull with the back of her hand. As she does the magical trap cast upon the body triggers as a Guiding Bolt fires from the side of the room, emerging from somewhere unknown between two pillars, piercing right through her shoulder, a strong burning sensation present within it. Realising that the bones were booby trapped, she grabs the blade, looking it over. She finds it to be dagger-like with an unfamiliar ornate design that is thin and light, yet sturdy. She passes it to Ahsha who also doesn't recognise its design either, but finds it exceptionally balanced and sharp

Ahsha asks Ephaine if the dagger has any significance. She responds that it looked like it might be useful and thought it was at least worth checking it out, but is otherwise unsure of its origin. She suggests it might have been worth the damage she sustained to take it. The party begin discussing who might benefit the most from taking it, Ephaine and Noon the most obvious candidates.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears next to Ahsha who is holding the blade, running her shadowy hand across the metal slowly, seemingly inspecting it. She renders her verdict before disappearing:

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> This one's exceptionally sharp.

Noons eyes flare up as he becomes intensely interested in the dagger. Ahsha realises this, handing the dagger ([Grievous Weapon](../items/magic/enchantments/grievous-weapon.md): Dagger) to him by the hilt. Ahsha suggests that if Noon likes the look of it despite his discerning taste for fine weaponry, it must be worth him having. Ahsha asks Ephaine if there is any magic left in the room. When Ephaine explains that it will take time for her to ritual cast a spell to find out, Ahsha suggests leaving it, not wishing to spend more time in this room.

Ahsha takes a closer look at the four [Chausain platinum coins](../items/coins/chausain-platinum-coin.md) she picked up, noticing their crescent moon shape. She has no idea where these coins come from. The rest of the party take a look at them out of curiosity. Ephaine, able to read [elvish](../languages/elvish.md), notices that they say "Platinum" on the front, and "Chausain" on the back, though she doesn't know what the latter means. Ahsha hands out a coin to each person.

Ahsha asks Ephaine about getting the door open. She activates her Starry Form: Archer while the party is still near the body in the middle of the room. She looks to the door, seeing the points of light in the shape of the archer constellation upon them. Confident that she knows how the mechanism works, she fires a spectral arrow at the door, but it does not open. She is surprised, wondering out loud if she broke the door, or if it might only open once. She heads over to investigate, raising her hand to the door, but before she can touch it, it begins to slide downwards, everyone realising that there is a proximity element to its activation.

## The Corridor Beyond

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) looks into the next corridor, seeing a rectangular corridor lined with stone slabs that fade out into darkness, even with darkvision. Ephaine is cautious but encourages everyone through quickly, not sure how long the door will stay open for. As [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) heads through last, the door begins to close due to Ephaine being too far away from it as she begins to lead the party forwards. As the door closes, the corridor goes pitch black. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) casts Dancing Lights to add to Ephaine's Starry Form glow.

Ephaine leads the party along the corridor, traversing the flat and geometrically precise built corridor. The party notice that it is colder in here than the room they came through. After 15 minutes the stonework gives way to a similarly rectangular dirt tunnel that quickly transitions into ice on all four sides. Ephaine suggests that this passage must cut through the glacier, taking her aback. She asks if everyone is okay to continue, noting it will only get colder. The corridor begins to rise ever so slightly as it transitions into ice.

For half an hour the party continues, slowed down by the slippery icy floor. The corridor is notable for its lack of disturbance, marks or chipped ice, suggesting it hasn't been touched before. Ephaine thinks upon its construction, realising that it remains perfectly rectangular with only slight undulations that are predictable and repeating. She sees no signs that this was made by people, but knows of no naturally occurring process that could produce such a tunnel. The ground begins sloping upwards, but doesn't slow them down any further. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) equips her crampons just in case it gets any steeper.

After another half an hour Noon's Dancing Lights reflect sharply off something further up the tunnel to one side. The party approaches to find a large growth of quartz sprouting from the seam between the floor and right hand wall, its glassy crystals appearing like clear diamond against the blue hue of the ice around them. It is about 1ft wide and 2ft tall. Ahsha suggests not touching it, wary of the traps they've already experienced.

Over the next hour the tunnel levels out again, turns right, ascends again. They pass several moments where the tunnel shifts a foot over to the side, as if whatever created it stopped and started again. Tiredness begins to kick in as the party realises that they set off at nightfall and have likely been awake throughout the entire night. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) take 1 point of exhaustion as they hit their physical limit for the day.

Ahsha recognises Ephaine's tiredness, wondering if they should stop and take a break. Ephaine isn't sure, wanting to press on and learn more about this place. Ahsha asks if her people created this but Ephaine is sure they didn't, suggesting it might be older than the [Cepine](../lineages/cepine.md) presence in this part of the world over the last few hundred years, which is unexplainable and perhaps concerning. Ephaine casts Star Mote (Produce Flame) to pull down a piece of star, clutching it somewhat closely for warmth, before continuing on without debate. The rest of the party follow.

The corridor grows even colder as they go, each person's breath clearly visible as they breathe. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) is unbothered by the temperature, her draconic lineage making her resistant to such conditions. After another hour the corridor grows even steeper, reaching close to a 45 degree incline for about 30ft - difficult terrain to traverse when icy. The party slowly and carefully makes their way up, Ephaine reaching the top first.

She notices several stone slabs that make up the flat floor at the top, the stone corridor resuming suddenly. As Noon's Dancing Lights hover up to the top of the slope, the party look upon a 20ft long section of stone corridor that terminates at a wall, with a regular sized thick stone door set deep into it.

## Sleeping in the Corridor

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) suggests that this would be a good place to rest before they see what lies beyond the door, advising everyone to bundle up in their sleeping bags and bed rolls. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) agrees, stating that the party will bed down and get some sleep, but wonders if conditions will be better on the other side of the door. Ephaine and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) caution that danger might lay on the other side of the door, so they should play it safe and camp here in the cold, taking watches as they would in the wilderness. Everyone does their best to brace themselves for a cold sleep.

| Character(s) | Shift | Observations |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md)<br>[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) | 4h | Nothing. Unnerving silence. |
| [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) | 4h | Nothing. |

An hour after Ahsha beds down, [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears, cross-legged in front of the doorway, staring at Noon.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> So [Brother Light](../characters/noon-schiller.md), what do you make of all of this?

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Intriguing.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Quite the understatement, don't you think?

Noon shrugs, dismissive of the question, suggesting it is his usual nature to understate.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Well... good luck with what lies ahead.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) stands and slowly walks backwards, passing through the stone door. Noon smirks before getting back to his watch.

*[Everyone: long rest]*  
*Everyone gains two more hit dice back than normal.*

The party wakes up after a well earned rest. As they stir, they begin to realise that they have slept exceptionally well, finding more strength within themselves than they would normally.

Ephaine has breakfast before ritual casting Detect Magic. She detects a magical presence from the dagger that Noon took from the previous room. She informs Noon that there's something special about it. He takes the dagger out, expressing his lack of surprise before offering it to Ephaine for a closer look. She takes it, looking closer and learning that its school of magic is necromancy. She tells Noon that it gives her a sense of the dead and decay, now more confident that it belongs with Noon. Ephaine shivers slightly as Noon pockets it.

## The Chalice Trial

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) then notices a small magical presence on the opposite side of the stone door. By moving side to side she can tell that it's not immediately on the other side of the door. She informs the group before heading over to the door to look for how they might enter. She finds decorative carvings, an image of a mountain with holes chipped into the top half to represent stars, an artist's impression rather than a star map. She finds no handle or gap around the door, but fails to notice the large stone hinges. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) joins her, but learns nothing new.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) asks if everyone is ready, the party responding positively. Ephaine suggests that she needs to activate her Starry Form to get the door open, choosing Starry Form: Dragon. After doing so she looks at the door but finds no points of light on it, dismayed that she must have done something wrong. Heading over to the door she tries to push on it, not getting it to move but getting small bits of stone dust to fall from the top edge, suggesting it can move.

Ahsha suggests herself and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) can help, but realises there is only room in the deep door frame for one of them to push. Ephaine goes to cast Guidance on her but Korina beats her to it, helping Ahsha with the task. Ahsha pushes hard, the door swinging open to the left and impacting the other side of the thick door frame with a thud that echoes throughout the dark interior. Ephaine hears the sound of movement from within and warns the party.

Looking around Ahsha, Ephaine glances into the room to see the source of the magical glow she observed with Detect Magic. In the darkness she sees the glowing outline of a [Quartz Chalice](../items/magic/quartz-chalice.md) floating at about eye level, the pedestal it is sat on obscured by darkness. Deeper in she catches a view of one of the large cobwebs suspended from ceiling to floor, perceiving something rope-like suspended across the ceiling.

## Chalices and Chitine

As [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) glances about the room, she spots furry arms holding daggers moving towards the door frame from the right hand side of the space, a chitine intent on killing those who trespass in this forbidden place.

Looking into the room, [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) spots the six eyed, four armed, dagger wielding spider-like chitine before her, a second just behind. The room is cross-shaped with a lower section accessed by stairs on all four sides, each with pedestals with [Quartz Chalices](../items/magic/quartz-chalice.md) on them. Two chitine are present at each shrine, having descended from the magical darkness above each, giving them access to the room by descending on spider webs.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Ahsha moves into the room and slashes at the first chitine, cutting it once before missing the second swing. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) casts Shield of Faith on [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) who is stood outside of the room on the other side of the door, before moving into the corner of the corridor, lying in wait.

The next closest four chitine in the room descend upon Ahsha, two now in range, plunging 6 daggers towards her. Only one manages to connect with her, inflicting the first party wound of the battle. She begins to rage as combat begins in anger.

Ephaine enters the room and moves over to the left before casting Moonbeam on the two chitine on her side of the room. [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) casts Eldritch Blast at the chitine in front of Ahsha, throwing it to the ground and killing the first enemy in this room. Noon remains in the corridor and stays near to Korina.

Ahsha turns to the next chitine, slicing it twice to take it down, wasting no time to then charge up to the next one. Korina enters the room at her slower speed and prepares for incoming enemies.

As the party fights on, everyone but Noon observes two more chitine rappel from the magical darkness on the ceiling above each chalice and pedestal, the room rapidly filling with enemies. This includes the chalice in front of Ahsha, Korina, and Ephaine, totalling 5 chitine in the first part of the room alone.

One chitine burns up from the harsh radiant energy of Ephaine's Moonbeam while another runs through it, seemingly uncaring about the dangerous area effect. The chitine in this part of the room descend on their targets, flurries of daggers raining down on each person. Ahsha and Korina take 1 hit each, Ephaine takes 4.

Ephaine repositions her Moonbeam closer to her, catching the two chitine that just attacked her. She throws a Star Mote (Produce Flame) at the dark spot above the chalice, hoping it might do something. The projectile vanishes as it crosses the threshold of the magical darkness before it is heard after a few seconds impacting the space beyond. Noon casts Eldritch Blast at the chitine in front of Ephaine, hitting it twice (once critically), blasting it 10ft across the room into the nearby wall, cracking its head open.

Another two chitine per chalice appear, triggering Ephaine's sense of dread and desperation as two chitine descend from the roof in front of Korina and next to the chalice. Ahsha looks upon the chalice near to her, darting out of the way of the enemies around her before grabbing the chalice from the pedestal and running back out of the room. Nothing appears to change in the room as she grabs the chalice.

Korina uses her breath weapon to hit 3 of the chitine, icing 2 of them severely. She follows Ahsha out of the room, sensing a retreat in progress, but is unable to squeeze past Ahsha, stuck in the door frame, unwilling to potentially damage the chalice Ahsha is holding.

Ephaine stands in the corner of the room as both chitine are burned up by Moonbeam. A third charges at her, meeting the same fate, while numerous other chitine race across the room. Six chitine are now present on the closest side of the room, one landing no strikes on Ephaine while Korina takes 3 hits, one critical, her wounds growing more severe.

Ephaine decides to try moving one of the chalices from its pedestal, shooting Guiding Bolt at the one on the far side of the room. It is hit squarely, falling to the ground behind the pedestal, shattering into pieces. She then squeezes past a chitine, Korina and Ahsha to get into the corridor while the chitine give chase. She moves her Moonbeam so that it is positioned right outside of the door, bathing three chitine in radiance.

Noon casts Mage Armour on himself and gets out of the way of the doorway, making space for everyone else retreating. Ahsha drops the [quartz chalice](../items/magic/quartz-chalice.md) on the ground, shattering it into pieces, before grabbing Korina and pulling her into the room, placing herself in the firing line from the incoming chitine. Korina holds her action in case anything enters the corridor.

Ephaine's moonbeam destroys four more chitine as they swarm towards the doorway. One gets into the door frame, connecting with Ahsha once as she shields the party from danger.

## Returning Into the Room

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) considers her options, recognising that her Starry Form: Chalice is related to healing, suggesting that if this room is themed like the last one, some amount of healing magic might be required to survive here. She activates that Starry Form, peeking around the corner and looking across the room. She recognises points of light on the far side of the room in the shape of the chalice constellation. She gets ready to head back into the room, getting desperate to stop the seemingly endless emerging chitine.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) casts Summon Shadowspawn (fury), causing [Nills](../characters/nills.md) to appear in the very centre of the room.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Some assistance would be kindly appreciated, dear sister!

As [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears she lets out a Dreadful Scream, frightening many of the chitine that are hanging around the pedestals that they emerged from above. She then makes her way up the stairs on the far side of the room, planting her shadowy form between a large group of frightened chitine. Immediately after, two more chitine emerge from above each pedestal, the room quickly saturating with chitine in every corner.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) cuts down the chitine standing in the doorway. She steps forward and attacks on of the others behind it, cutting one more down with a single swing of her greataxe, before retreating back into the corridor. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) steps up and attempts to close the door, encouraged on by Ahsha, but fails to get a good grip on it, retreating into the corridor in defeat.

As the closest pack of chitine rush into the room, several pass through the moonbeam. The doorway fills up with three chitine who breach into the corridor beyond. On the other side of the room three chitine stab at [Nills](../characters/nills.md) repeatedly whose intangible form fills up with stab wounds.

Ephaine takes a leap of faith, casting Misty Step to re-enter the room near the closest pedestal, intent on reaching one of the intact [quartz chalices](../items/magic/quartz-chalice.md). She runs down the stairs into the middle of the room while casting Cure Wounds on herself, benefiting from Starry Form: Chalice to heal herself even further. Ephaine braces for the worst as more chitine rappel into the room around her.

Noon casts Eldritch Blast on two of the chitine entering the room, missing with both blasts. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) disengages and moves over to Ephaine, conscious that the frightened chitine will be warded off from her.

Ahsha slices down the chitine inside the corridor, moving to the next one in the doorway, dispatching that one quickly as well. She gulps and attempts to squeeze past the third chitine to enter the room again, passing through Ephaine's Moonbeam in the process, taking some radiant damage as she goes. She attempts to draw their attention to her.

Korina crosses the corridor to get an angle on the right hand arm of the cross shaped room and casts Slow in an area that affects six chitine. Four succumb to the effect - three from the right hand arm of the room and one from the back.

Two more Chitine burn up in Ephaine's Moonbeam as a third rushes to Ahsha, hitting her once. From the other arms of the room a large amount of chitine swarm towards Ephaine, the slowed ones unable to reach her, the frightened ones unwilling to move closer to [Nills](../characters/nills.md). Three surround Ephaine, plunging nine daggers towards her, four puncturing her simultaneously, breaking her concentration on Moonbeam.

*[Initiative order paused]*
