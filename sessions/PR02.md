## Wolves In the Night

Around 2am, wolves descend on [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) from the north west.

[Torbra Tauff](../../../astarus/people/torbra-tauff.md) awakes in the night to the sound of close by growling. She wakes [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) who both also hear the growling, with two things moving through the fields outside quickly.

The first wolf entered the barn through a gap under the bottom of the barn wall, opened up by smaller creatures coming and going, dislodging the dirt and creating a rut. It attempted to bite the first cow it saw, but failed. After trying to attack Torbra it attempted to flee, but was taken down by a combination of Tobra’s halberd and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)’s ice spikes.

The second wolf attempted to enter the barn through the same hole but got stuck half-way through, exposing its head to those inside the barn. After the first wolf was killed it continued and eventually succeeded to enter before meeting a similar untimely end.

Torbra went to wake the Holyrooks while [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) hid the evidence that they had used magic to dispatch the wolves, by using the heat from a torch to melt the ice particles. Darien Holyrook investigated the barn and found the cows alive, if a little scared.

## Breakfast

The party wakes early by the Holyrooks. They are extremely grateful for the way the party fended off the wolves last night and put on a plentiful breakfast for them. It includes beef, freshly baked bread, cultivated butter, milk, simple cheeses and vegetables from their garden: lettuce, cucumber, and tomatoes.

Darien asks how they managed to kill the wolves. The party simply tells them that they used their weapons, not letting on about their magic. This answer is accepted.

The party heads on their way with leftover breakfast in their bags.

## [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) Wakes Up

At her family home, [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) wakes very early to the sound of movement on the edge of the forest to the east. She gets up and goes out to investigate, carefully approaching the edge of the forest to her east.

From here she sees a pack of wolves further east on the plains, running south. They are running in the direction of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) - but rather than running purposefully towards town they are clearly running away from something. Some of the wolves appear to be injured judging by how they move, and look backwards frequently. Towards the front of the pack is a much larger wolf.

[Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) follows the wolves at a safe distance to see what is going on.

## Heading Into Town

As the rest of the party is leaving [Holyrook Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/holyrook-farm.md) they meet back up with [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md). They agree to head into town together.

Near the edge of town they begin to hear noises: initially periodic screaming and panic, and as they get closer the sounds of commotion and wolves growling become audible.

The party discusses whether to rush into town to help, or continue at their current pace. Torbra and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) decide to run on ahead while [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) bring up the rear at a slower pace.
