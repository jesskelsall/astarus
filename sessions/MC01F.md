## A Letter for Vētrall

While away from [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md), [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) gets a letter from [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) ([L-MC-01](../letters/L-MC-01.md)). It details the death of [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md), with whom Vētrall was close. Hanz informs Vētrall of the Vulpes family's funeral plans and urges them to return to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) as soon as possible.

Vētrall begins making their way back to [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md).

## Accepting the Offer

Around mid-morning [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) makes his way to the top of [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md), arriving outside of [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md). He is carrying a [Coin of Friendship](../items/coins/coin-of-friendship.md) given to him on his travels, along with the promise that if he finds [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) in [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md), he'd be able to join the adventuring guild.

He notices [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) stood near the door to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md), and goes over to talk to him. He asks if he is in the right place, to which Hanz tells him that he is. Upon producing the coin, Hanz's eyes light up and a grin forms, excited by the prospect of a new member of the family. He confirms with Valan that he wishes to join. When Valan accepts, Hanz swings the door open and announces to everyone in the banquet hall:

*[Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md):*
> Joining us today, please welcome to the family [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md)!

The banquet hall, 2/3 full of family members, erupts into cheers and applause at the announcement, which continues as Valan makes his way inside, timid from the attention.

Immediately he is greeted by [Aneni Veomelo](../characters/aneni-veomelo.md) ([Treefrightener](../characters/aneni-veomelo.md)) who introduces herself as the Mother of the House. She wastes no time going in for a big hug before sitting Valan down and asking if he wants any food. When he asks for baked potatoes and wine, Aneni shouts to a member of the kitchen staff who fetches both at once, returning with freshly cooked baked potatoes and a mug of red wine.

Aneni informs Valan that he will be getting paired up with a mentor shortly, once they arrive. Valan is left to eat his meal and take in his new boisterous surroundings.

The tabaxi to his left, [Eight Trees](../characters/eight-trees.md), says hi and makes basic conversation about Valan being a new member. Eight comments on Valan being a Drow (dark elf), noting the rarity of meeting one. When he asks if Valan is from [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md) or the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), Valan tells him that he's actually from [the Dragonbrand](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/the-dragonbrand.md).

For the rest of the day Valan sits at the table and knits.

## Vētrall Arrives

That same day but closer to the evening, having made their way to The Fox's Hole, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) finds [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) outside as expected. The pair greet each other as warm friends, happy to see each other after some time apart. The pair share a sombre moment reflecting on the death of [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md). Hanz tells Vētrall that the Vulpes family will likely be bickering about inheritance but that he has risen above it so far, not interested in gossip.

Vētrall expresses their bemusement to Hanz that they have been selected to be a mentor, making it clear that they don't feel ready or willing. Hanz reiterates his point from his letter, telling Vētrall that they have earned good standing within [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) and as such this is recognition of that. Turning the offer down would be an insult. He also reveals that he put Vētrall forward to be a mentor, showing his faith in them.

Vētrall reluctantly agrees, asking Hanz when they will meet their student. Hanz tells them that he arrived today and is waiting inside for them. He makes his way inside.

## [Mentor and Student](../storylines/mentor-and-student.md) Meet

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) is greeted by [Aneni Veomelo](../characters/aneni-veomelo.md) who greets them with her signature enthusiasm and hug. She wastes no time ushering Vētrall over to [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) who is sat at the table, mostly keeping to himself. Aneni sits Vētrall down next to him and gives them some space to get to know each other while not so subtly gushing several feet away, excited to see the pair meet.

Valan and Vētrall have quite a reserved introduction. Vētrall exudes nervousness, trying their best to cover it up with false confidence but failing. Valan is nonplussed.

The pair reflect on each others' appearance. Valan is struck by the unique light blue skin and hair of Vētrall, while Vētrall recognises Valan as a Drow - an uncommon sight in the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md), even to someone as well travelled as them.

Vētrall begins tuning their lute, attracting the attention of other members across the table who call out to them to play something, referring to them by their stage name: *[Whirlwind](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md)*. Vētrall obliges, playing an energetic and upbeat song about adventuring. The jovial atmosphere in the room is amplified as many members stamp their feet to the beat. Valan hides his head under his hands, face down on the table in embarrassment due to his proximity to this intensely charismatic performance.

Not long after, [Drendoc](../characters/drendoc.md) is introduced to the room:

*[Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md):*
> Returning to us, [Drendoc the Warrior](../characters/drendoc.md), who has shared 50 gold with his family!

Once again the room bursts into cheers as [Drendoc](../characters/drendoc.md) walks through the room, holding a sizeable coin purse aloft, the gold within clinking as he goes. After he passes Vētrall who makes eye contact, they remark under their breath that [Drendoc](../characters/drendoc.md) is being a show off. Vētrall is clearly unhappy with feeling upstaged in this moment.

Aneni reappears soon after at the end of the table, announcing the meal in a booming voice, arms thrown in the air dramatically:

*[Aneni Veomelo](../characters/aneni-veomelo.md):*
> Dinner is served!

A group of kitchen staff march up from downstairs carrying bowls, platters, and plates of various meats, vegetables, fruits and drinks are distributed across the table. This banquet is greeted with excited cheers by the entire room. Other members emerge from downstairs, keen to dig in before the best of the food disappears, namely the carved meat.

Valan sees a small plate of [spiked rosemelon](../items/spiked-rosemelon.md), an unfamiliar delicacy to him. He watches as several people descend on the watermelon-like slices of the plant. Most take their piece with a knife or fork before a hand is swatted away due to the danger of the barbs. He takes a piece himself before it is all taken, cutting the skin from the flesh and taking a bite. Surprised by the sour rose/lemon flavour he involuntarily scrunches up his face, much to the delight of Vētrall.

Vētrall takes a piece himself. Understanding which pieces will be less bitter, they proudly eat their slice while keeping a straight face.

## A Request From Nearby

As dinner wraps up and plates are taken away, [Aneni Veomelo](../characters/aneni-veomelo.md) returns to speak to the pair. She explains that [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) recently received a letter from [Trubska](../places/settlements/villages/trubska.md) asking for help. She passes the already opened letter to [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) ([L-MC-02](../letters/L-MC-02.md)). They read [Oronar Redtooth](../characters/oronar-redtooth.md)'s words about a brown bear plaguing the villagers and the call for help.

Aneni explains to the pair that she held onto this letter just for them as an introductory adventure through which Vētrall could show [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) the ropes. Upon their success and return she will present the pair with coins:

| Character | Coin |
| --- | --- |
| [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) | [Coin of Friendship](../items/coins/coin-of-friendship.md) |
| [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) | [Coin of Family](../items/coins/coin-of-family.md) |

Vētrall agrees. Understanding that [Trubska](../places/settlements/villages/trubska.md) is about a day's travel and with nightfall upon them, they tell Valan that the pair will set off in the morning. They both take spare bunk beds in the lower level of [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) for the night.

*[Long rest]*

In the morning the pair reconvene over breakfast, partaking of the platter of cooked bacon, eggs, and fresh baked bread laid out in three areas of the lodge table.

Before heading out, Vētrall heads down into [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) to buy a new component pouch (25 gp) before they set off. Valan uses this time to explore [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md), following the hustle bustle of commerce to the [Trest Marketplace](../places/structures/trest-marketplace.md) which is busy taking in shipments and setting up for the day's sales.

Now well fed and supplied, the pair meet back up at [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) and make their way a few buildings west before finding the trail to [Trubska](../places/settlements/villages/trubska.md) emerging between two buildings.

## North to [Trubska](../places/settlements/villages/trubska.md)

Heading north along the trail, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) ascend the hilly road towards the [Nilus Peaks](../places/topography/mountains/nilus-peaks.md). Vētrall leads the way, taking point on the day's travel.

About half way along the route Vētrall steps in some innocuous tufts of grass on the roadside, almost stepping directly on a poisonous snake. The snake coils out of the way and instinctively lunges to take a bite with its fangs.

*[Initiative order begins]*

A second poisonous snake slithers out of the grass near Valan. The pair attempt to stab the snakes with their dagger and rapier, but the snakes are tricky to hit as they coil and turn.

Valan is struck by his snake, feeling the poison course into his leg, injuring him. Vētrall reacts to this by casting Healing Word on Valan before casting Dissonant Whispers on that snake, obliterating its mind and ending its life.

The other snake is finished off with a combination of Dissonant Whispers and a well timed stab of Vētrall's rapier.

*[Initiative order ends]*

Valan reflects on feeling helpless in the fight, taking a near fatal hit almost immediately, and being consistently outclassed by his mentor. It is a humbling moment. Vētrall is keen to proceed onward.

*[Short rest]*

## Meeting the [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md)

By late afternoon the pair arrive in [Trubska](../places/settlements/villages/trubska.md). It is a quiet village with a few labourers coming and going, but nobody pays them any mind. Exploring deeper into the village they come across the stone fountain and next to it [the Three Goats](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-three-goats.md) inn. They head inside.

Inside a collection of miners are eating their dinner, drinking, and quietly conversing across their tables. [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) notices a table full of [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md), identified by their leathers, weapons, and turquoise leather pauldrons.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) heads up to the bar and is greeted by [Lionhunter](../characters/lionhunter.md). They order 2 ales (8 cp) before making it clear that they're both from [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md), here to sort out the bear problem, and that as a result they'd like to stay the night free of charge in exchange for a bardic performance. [Lionhunter](../characters/lionhunter.md) rebuffs the audacity of the request but invites Vētrall to perform their best and they'll consider it.

At this point [Oronar Redtooth](../characters/oronar-redtooth.md) has got up from the table of [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md) and came over to speak to the pair. He has overheard their conversation at the bar and thanks them for coming. He provides more details of the bear's location, explaining that it is mostly seen around a northern mining camp. Vētrall asks if Oronar can show them the area in the morning. Oronar agrees.

That evening Vētrall plays the lute. Initially starting with a low temp low energy performance, they build it up over time. This draws in a crowd of not only people in the inn, but those from the village who quickly learn through word of mouth about the performance, bringing more patrons into the inn. [Lionhunter](../characters/lionhunter.md) is ecstatic, pouring drinks to the new patrons who stay for a good time. Vētrall is never without an ale all night, downing five before finishing their performance.

Meanwhile Valan sits at a quieter table and resumes his knitting. He makes do with ale as the inn has no wine.

By the end of the night [Lionhunter](../characters/lionhunter.md) is convinced enough to give them a double room for the night for free, on the condition that Vētrall plays again in the morning before they head off. The pair are happy with the deal and head to bed. Their room mercifully has two single beds. Vētrall falls asleep quickly as they are tipsy.

*[Long rest]*

In the morning Valan wakes up first. He packs up his things before waking Vētrall who is rough from the night before but otherwise fighting fit.

Heading downstairs the pair are greeted by an annoyed [Lionhunter](../characters/lionhunter.md) who chastises Vētrall for waking up late, missing the potential morning customers who by now are on their way to the mines. Vētrall honours their deal regardless, bringing in a small handful of customers who missed the performance the night before.

After finishing breakfast, Vētrall pays for extra bacon off-cuts to take with them, thinking ahead about luring the bear.

The pair ask [Lionhunter](../characters/lionhunter.md) where Oronar is, as he promised to show them where the bear could be found. [Lionhunter](../characters/lionhunter.md) leaves the inn, leaving the pair and a couple of patrons unattended briefly. They return after about 5 minutes with Oronar.

Oronar is like a different person this morning. He is still drunk and reeks of booze. He is not very present, avoiding eye contact, and fails to recall who the party are and what their business is here until prompted. Eventually they coerce him into pointing them toward the bear. He is able to point them to the north west, which is enough for them to abandon him here in the bar due to his condition.

## Searching for the Bear

The pair make their way north east across rolling fields, heading vaguely in the direction given to them. They proceed for several hours before coming across a dragonborn labourer walking the same way as them over to their right some 60ft. They attempt to shout to him but he is unable to hear them over the gentle wind blowing in the wrong direction.

Not deterred they follow him to the northern mining camp. A mine set into the side of a partially excavated hill attached to a wooden shack entrance, the site is surrounded by large tents held up with wooden structures. Inside labourers are preparing tools and moving supplies while others load up two carts hitched to horses, ready to head down to [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) for sale.

The pair briefly converse with the labourers who are able to point them more precisely in the direction that the bear attacked one of their own from.

Heading back out across the hills, the gently undulating grassy fields give way to thicker foliage and sharp jagged outcroppings. The pair snake their way between these rocky features, occasionally climbing up one to get their bearings and plan ahead.

## Axe Beaks Abound

At one point they ascend one such rock and see two Axe Beaks in a flat clearing ahead. [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) recognises the birds as large and flightless, but also spots indiscernible tracks heading across the area that they occupy.

Taking a moment to assess their options, the pair decide to carefully make their way around the perimeter, keeping the birds in their sight. Half way around the axe beaks get spooked and stare directly at the pair. Not picking up on the subtle danger signal, they continue unfazed until both axe beaks screech at them and begin bolting towards them. The party chooses to run away but Valan trips, instinctively grabbing [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) on the way down, bringing both to the floor.

*[Initiative order begins]*

The pair immediately get to their feet and prepare to fight. Valan readies his longbow and looses an arrow into the front of one of the axe beaks, angering it further. It dawns on the pair that the birds are quite fast and will close the gap quickly.

Vētrall readies the Cloud of Daggers spell, casting it only when an axe beak gets into close range of the party. When they do, a rain shower of metal daggers descends from the sky, each sinking loudly into the ground and the axe beaks or clanking against each other, creating a metallic rain sound.

The first axe beaks runs directly into this shower of daggers, getting quickly beating down by the impact of the blades. One flies through its long neck, gushing blood all over Vētrall's fine clothes, before the bird collapses to the ground.

Valan continues to fire arrows at the axe beaks throughout, connecting several more times. As the second approaches Vētrall through the knife storm, they jam their rapier down, piercing its body and striking its heart, causing it to collapse suddenly to the floor.

*[Initiative order ends]*

As Vētrall lets go of his spell, the daggers that peppered the birds and the ground dissipate like dust on the wind, leaving behind the very real holes and fatal wounds. 

Having taken out both axe beaks before sustaining any injuries, the pair bond over their swift teamwork. Vētrall feels confident that they put on a good show of their power to Valan, using magic taught to them by their own mentor. Valan was intimidated by Vētrall's power, the Cloud of Daggers doing most of the work.

## Confronting the Bear

With the axe beaks taken care of, [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) examines the tracks through the area. He is unable to tell that they belong to the bear, but does rule out people footsteps. It is also unclear whether this is one bear making multiple trips or multiple bears.

Valan follows the tracks while [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) keeps an eye on their rear. Valan is so focused on keeping up with the tracks that he's not watching for danger ahead.

Soon they arrive at a narrowing area hemmed in by tall rock faces that come to a point. Where they do, a cave mouth can be seen, though the space beyond is too dark to see from range.

The pair plan to lure out the bear. Both hide behind separate bushes, Vētrall not feeling confident about their coverage. They take out the bacon slices they were given by [Lionhunter](../characters/lionhunter.md) and throw the linen bundle towards the area in front of the cave mouth. The linen splits open, scattering bacon across the ground noisily.

The lone brown bear stirs inside the cave. It moves to the mouth and looks for signs of the disturbance but sees none. Instead it finds a trail of fresh meat. It lumbers over and sniffs the closest piece before eating it. Slowly it eats the first two slices before grabbing the third and turning to return to its cave.

This panics the pair who were thinking of how to act. Valan makes the first move, loosing an arrow toward the bear.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Valan's arrow strikes the bear in its side, causing it to roar and turn towards him, beginning a charge. Vētrall casts Blindness/Deafness to try and blind the bear but it resists the effect. Valan begins running away to keep range on the bear, firing arrows as he goes.

Vētrall casts Levitate, part of their air genasi lineage. They float 15 feet into the air, turning upside down.

*Valan Astérr:*
> Over here, you stupid fuck.

The bear hears Vētrall's taunt. Not clever enough to realise they are out of reach, it tries to swipe up at Vētrall but misses. This provides Valan with more time to open up a gap and take another shot. When this arrow strikes the bear in the shoulder, it refocuses on him, panicking Vētrall who isn't able to move freely while levitating.

As the bear charges toward Valan, Vētrall stops levitating, slowly falling to the ground. They run closer to the bear and cast Dissonant Whispers, singing a discordant melody which wracks the bear's brain. This gives Valan an opening to attack.

He lets loose an arrow, scoring a critical hit. The accuracy and force of the arrow pierces the bear's skull between the eyes, the arrow flying cleanly out of the other side. The bear immediately falls to the floor, dead.

*[Initiative order ends]*

The pair celebrate the bear's death before briefly considering investigating the cave for more bears, but decide not to. Vētrall tells Valan that they need to cut the bear's head off so they can take it back to [Trubska](../places/settlements/villages/trubska.md) as proof that the deed is done. Valan begrudgingly agrees to cut it off. The process is hard work and results in a rough and gory cut at a dramatic diagonal angle - no good for wall mounting.

An argument quickly breaks out over who will be carrying the head back to the village. Vētrall, still upset over the blood on their fine clothes after the axe beak battle, insists that their student should carry it. Valan puts up a fair fight but eventually succumbs, feeling that the pair need to get on with the task.

On the way back Valan asks Vētrall about their ability to levitate. Vētrall rebuffs the question, divulging nothing.

*[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md):*
> Why can you fly?

*[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md):*
> Why can you not?

## A Deed Well Done

The pair spend the rest of the day trekking back to [Trubska](../places/settlements/villages/trubska.md), where they enter [the Three Goats](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-three-goats.md) inn to find [Oronar Redtooth](../characters/oronar-redtooth.md). Vētrall grabs the bear head and kicks the door open while holding the head over their own in triumph. This startles the [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md) inside who instinctively jump to their feet and grab their weapons before realising who it is.

[Lionhunter](../characters/lionhunter.md) insists that Vētrall leaves the bear head outside due to the now partially congealed blood getting everywhere.

The pair are greeted by Oronar who seems much more like the person they met the evening before - well put together and presenting a brave and authoritative face. He congratulates the pair on a job well done and hands Vētrall two small coin pouches, each containing 20 gp - one for them, one for [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md).

The pair remain at the inn overnight. They are once again given free accommodation, now accompanied by free food and drink as thanks for their efforts. Vētrall plays their lute once again, playing a song they already knew about bears. As patrons come to the inn they are greeted by the bear head outside, causing them to come inside and learn of the party's exploits that day. Each time this happens more drinks are bought, keeping the inn lively throughout the evening.

*[Long rest]*

In the morning the pair make the journey back down the trail to [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md), going straight into [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md). Presenting the 20 gp to [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md), he introduced their pair as they entered:

*[Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md):*
> Returning to us, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), who have shared 20 gold with their family!

## A Legend's Funeral

On their return, preparations are in place for [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s funeral. Down the right hand side of [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) are ceremonial wreaths surrounding a exquisite oil painting of the [fennec](../lineages/fennec.md).

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) spots [Vulpes Soon](../characters/vulpes-soon.md), Geen's eldest son, talking quietly to someone at the table. Once the conversation ends they catch Soon, passing on condolences. Soon receives them well but isn't talkative due to his mourning. Vētrall, who knew Geen well but hasn't spoken to Soon in any real capacity, leaves him to his business.

*[Several days pass]*

After a few days of rest, it is the day of [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s funeral.

On the day Vētrall is asked to be a pallbearer, carring Geen's coffin from [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) down to the water's edge of the [Gulf of Tanelle](../places/topography/seas-bays/gulf-of-tanelle.md) to the south west. A 200 strong congregation of Vulpes family, [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members, and dignitaries from [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) and [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) follow the procession down a gently sloping path to the water's edge. [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) is accompanied by [Eight Trees](../characters/eight-trees.md). The portrait of Geen is held aloft the entire way, and several members play drums and instruments.

Down on the water's edge a pedestal is waiting for the coffin. Vētrall helps place the coffin down before joining the rest of the congregation. A 600 year old high elf Judge Mother of [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) gives a sermon about how the legacy of Geen lives on through everyone, and it is now their responsibility to remember him and honour that legacy so that he may continue to live.

After the service, the journey is made in reverse back to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md).

Once there, a huge banquet is put on by [Aneni Veomelo](../characters/aneni-veomelo.md) and the kitchen staff. Geen's coffin is placed in the middle of the lodge table and surrounded by the wreaths of flowers, with his portrait placed on top. The banquet is laid out around this, filling the entire table with food and drink.

Many of the dignitaries stick around for the wake. Much drink is consumed and many songs are sang. Vētrall debuts a song they were thinking up on their travel to and from [Trubska](../places/settlements/villages/trubska.md). As the night unfolds, word of the song goes around, prompting those who missed it to ask for an encore. In all Vētrall plays it over ten times that night.

*[Long rest]*

## Geen's Will

Early the following morning, [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s last will is read between the Vulpes family. [Vulpes Soon](../characters/vulpes-soon.md) gains possession of [Mémoire de Unevaire](../items/echneshment/weapons/memoire-de-unevaire.md).

When [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) finally emerges for breakfast, they find [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) already up. [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) is starting his shift as Father of the Door for the day but notices Vētrall and comes over to speak with them.

He hands Vētrall a letter ([L-MC-03](../letters/L-MC-03.md)), plainly explaining that this came with Geen's will. Hanz doesn't cause any commotion, trying to keep the letter private out of respect for Vētrall.

Vētrall takes the letter to a private corner, opening it and reading it. It is a letter from [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) that contains an ornate key ([MC01F-I-3](../cards/MC01F-I-3.md)) for a strongbox (`FV-1286`) in the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) in [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md). Geen warns Vētrall not to open it inside the building due to his personal feelings about the aura of the place.

Returning to the banquet hall, Vētrall finds [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) eating baked potatoes for breakfast. They tell Valan that they should hit the road to [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) today as they have business there, choosing not to disclose what exactly.

Before heading out the pair stock up on supplies. Vētrall purchases a shortbow, quiver, a full set of arrows, and a length of rope.

## Off to [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md)

The pair hit the road to [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md). Their travel is skipped over in order to begin the next session in [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) itself.
