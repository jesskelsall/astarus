## Pre-session

### [Inspiration Pool](../mechanics/dm-inspiration.md)

2 dice.

## Trying to Camp

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) gets ready to spend the night in a wooded depression at the northernmost part of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). Here amongst the overshadowing cliffs they decide how best to look after [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) and the dire wolf ([Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md)).

Scratch remains close to unconsciousness while the dire wolf remains close, its head on Scratch's. The party assesses their options, realising that they are out of healing items and magic which might help rouse the tabaxi so that he can instruct the dire wolf to move out of the way. This would allow [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to cast Tiny Hut around the party and Scratch.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) approaches the white dire wolf, presenting the back of her hand for it to smell. Elrick doesn't hear Thanea but after a moment smells her scent before sniffing her hand and arm. Thanea recognises it is docile, stroking its head. She tries to lead it away from Scratch, moving her hand away in increments, encouraging it with each movement. The wolf stands, hesitantly following her, but after a few feet it hesitates. It looks back and forth between Scratch and Thanea, unsure what to do.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) heads into the recess in the cliffside where Scratch was originally found. As she collects a length of rope and papers from his strewn possessions, the wolf watches her intently, growling slightly. Saoirse joins Thanea, the possessions helping to draw it away from Scratch. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is able to cast Tiny Hut around herself, Scratch, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md), and [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md). When the spell completes, Saoirse is annoyed to find that she cannot enter, not realising this would be the case.

After the opaque dome appears, the dire wolf is surprised when it next looks towards Scratch to not see him, much to its visible surprise. It paces around the dome, sniffing its edge before pawing at its energy wall and whimpering. It smells [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) within. Saoirse approaches the wolf with the possessions she holds and places them on the floor for it. It is unmoved by the gesture, lying down against the edge of the dome, its compressed fur visible to those inside the dome.

Thanea searches nearby for small trees that can be used as firewood. Without difficulty she returns and lights a campfire while Saoirse sets up their sleeping bags for the night. Allisa emerges from the dome and begins unrolling her bed roll from her pack.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> So you're keeping us company out here in the cold?

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> You didn't think I was leaving you alone out here, did you?

Thanea questions Allisa's decision to leave the warmth of the dome, stating that she wouldn't have begrudged her for staying inside of it. Allisa rubbishes the idea, preferring the cold as it "keeps the mind sharp" while on watch.

## Apprehension and Destiny

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) begins arranging night watches. [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) is quick to offer herself for first watch, but Thanea is concerned about how exhausted she might be after fighting earlier, as well as how much magic she might have left. Allisa states that she is still doing well. Thanea offers to join her on first watch.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) tries to snuggle up with the dire wolf, not wanting it to feel alone. It lies in a curled position, its front and hind legs almost touching. She places a hand on its side, feeling a brief reflex as it realises Saoirse is near for the first time due it having its eyes closed. As she sits down and lies against its side, it curls around her more, enveloping her in its fur and placing its head on the base of her legs. The wolf takes a large sigh before settling again.

| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)<br>[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | 4h | Uneventful. Small creatures, owls heard. |

Half way through Allisa and Thanea's watch, Allisa asks Thanea about how she thinks tomorrow will go. Thanea hopes they will learn more about what's going on here, believing something is important afoot and her path has been guided by her deva ([Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md)). Allisa advises she follows her deva's visions. She then asks Thanea if she has any more tricks up her sleeves but Thanea is dismissive of having more to offer. Thanea expresses a difference in feeling between her Radiant Soul and Healing Hands. Allisa describes radiant energy as an inner warmth.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> It's exciting though, right? Not knowing what the next day will hold.

Thanea tells Allisa that she has lived an uncertain life since she was young, though she would like some stability. Allisa explains her feeling that her quest for answers gives her purpose, meaning, and the drive to go on. Thanea confides in Allisa that her past choices to ignore her deva dreams have only burned her, so she feels forced down a path.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Sometimes I just wish it wasn't like this. Know what I mean?

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> It's a burden, but we've been selected or... it's just the way of the world, but it's our burden to bear. But it's not like we have to do it alone.

Allisa looks towards Saoirse and the Tiny Hut as she finishes what she's saying. Thanea agrees, explaining that she used to only have her mentor, but now she has "this chaotic bunch". Allisa reminds her that she also has her. 

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> That's true. What are the odds?

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> It's not chance. I don't believe in chance...

## A Gift for Saoirse

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) states to [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) that their watch is over, advising she gets some sleep. As Thanea beds down, Allisa wakes [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) who is still lying on the dire wolf. She is reluctant to wake for her watch, but Allisa encourages her up.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Well, a wolf is apparently a really good cushion. I haven't slept that well in ages.

Saoirse tells Allisa that she doesn't want to be on watch alone, moving back towards the dire wolf to wake it. Allisa states her need to sleep, but stops Saoirse to talk before her watch begins. She plainly tells Saoirse that she has a gift for her.

Allisa takes the [Citrine Eye Necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md) off from around her neck and gives it to Saoirse, holding both pointed edges of the citrine gem where the chain is connected as she presents it to her. Saoirse accepts, putting it around her neck before taking a good look at it. Even in the dark she can see its yellow-orange colour.

Saoirse calls it pretty, prettier than anything she's ever owned. When she tells Allisa that she will look after it until the morning, Allisa tells her that she'd like Saoirse to hold onto it for her for longer than that. She explains that it helps her channel her magic. Saoirse doubts it will help her with her own.

Rather than respond, Allisa takes the citrine gemstone and cups it in one hand before placing the palm of her other on top of it. As she closes her eyes she casts [Sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) several times, causing the gemstone to emit radiant light that emerges from between her hands. After 20 seconds or so she opens her eyes and carefully removes her hands, revealing to Saoirse that the gemstone is still faintly glowing with radiant energy.

*[[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) applies 7 charges of [Sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) to the [Citrine Eye Necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md)]*

Saoirse is visibly awestruck by the necklace around her neck. Allisa explains that while the necklace acts as a magical focus, there is more to it than that, a force that she cannot explain, one that helped her find her way (alluding to her and its connection to [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md)). She tells Saoirse that she hopes it will help her find her way too. Saoirse responds that she could definitely use the help, and is thankful.

Allisa recalls casting [Sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) on [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) not long after arriving via Dimension Door in the party's battle against the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md). She struggles through a description of what the spell does before explaining that she has placed the power of that spell into the necklace. She advises that Saoirse think on the necklace during her watch as it will allow her to tap into its power and draw it out a limited number of times. Allisa believes Saoirse has what it takes to control that divine magic. Saoirse is disparaging, suggesting she doesn't have the best track record with looking after things.

Allisa makes it clear that she would like the necklace back when they next meet, stating that they *will* meet again. Allisa then heads to bed.

During her watch, Saoirse observes the radiant glow dissipates over the next hour. After focusing on the [Citrine Eye Necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md) during this time, she notices that her understanding of her surroundings has sharpened slightly (+1 Wisdom).

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## Venison for Breakfast

As the sun begins to rise, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) looks towards the Tiny Hut. She quickly realises that the dire wolf is nowhere to be seen. She searches for it nearby but finds no clues to its whereabouts. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) exits the Tiny Hut to sneak up on Saoirse and ask what's going on. In doing so the dome disappears.

The pair hear noise from the nearby treeline as the sound of quadrupedal running grows closer. Emerging from the trees is the dire wolf, a dead doe grasped by the neck in its mouth, blood visible. After walking over to the party it stands for a moment before lowering its head and releasing the doe, which drops to the ground with a gentle thud.

The party is thankful for the unexpected morning meal. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) begins to skin the deer while [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) tries to praise the dire wolf, but it instead moves past her and checks on [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md). In preparing the venison [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) tries to preserve its skin to keep, but ends up puncturing it with her dagger clumsily. Regardless she is able to set the venison up on a makeshift spit roast over the campfire.

Saoirse goes over to Scratch and uses Healing Hands to provide some more healing.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) can be seen unclipping the lower portion of her metal face mask, revealing a thin mouth slot. She passes thinly cut strips of cooked venison through it, clearly taking much longer to eat than everyone else due to the limitation of what she can pass through the slot.

## Planning Ahead

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) suggests that the party consider their plan of action if they are returning to the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater in [Upper Tresenda](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/upper-tresenda.md).

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) asks what vulnerabilities the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) have. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) plainly states that sharp weapons aren't affective. Saoirse suggests that this is because Torbra's halberd isn't magical.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) recants [Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) casting Dispel Magic on [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) that was moving of its own accord, though she notes that her own efforts to cast the spell on [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) had no effect. Saoirse recommends gathering any remaining dust they find without touching it.

Saoirse is apprehensive of using her Necrotic Shroud, but notes how it often scares those around her when her wings appear, something they can use to their advantage providing the rest of the party aren't also nearby. Saoirse and Thanea discuss whether it would be best to grab the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) or kill [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) first. Thanea wonders what someone would do in battle if they had hold of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md).

Allisa asks what the party would like her to do during combat. Saoirse asks Allisa to help the party with healing magic, as their fights with [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) usually involve near death experiences. Allisa describes [Death Ward](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/death-ward), suggesting she could cast it on Torbra to protect against a fatal blow. Torbra wonders if it would not be better casting it on someone less hardy. Allisa explains that whoever she casts it on should be giving it their all. Torbra remains sceptical.

Saoirse suggests she casts [Sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) with the [Citrine Eye Necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md) on Torbra instead to make her harder to hit, allowing Allisa to cast something else that is potent.

Thanea suggests that the radiant damage infused into her attacks with Radiant Soul does more damage. Allisa recommends she attacks from the sky, but Thanea cautions against it, recanting getting blasted out of the sky in their last battle before Allisa arrived.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is keen to get going, her strategy simply being to stab the creatures.

Allisa uses Healing Hands herself on [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md), helping to scab over more of his remaining open wounds. She recommends moving Scratch back into the cliffside recess for shelter while they return to the crater. Torbra helps her move Scratch back into the recess. The dire wolf still growls, but it is apparent that it is becoming more comfortable with the party moving him as they gain its trust.

Saoirse asks Torbra for some paper and her ink so she can pen a message to leave with Scratch. It explains in brief that Scratch is being looked after by [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and they will return.

Saoirse pets the dire wolf as a form of goodbye, the wolf barely acknowledging her petting its snout. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) tells it to protect Slaine until they get back, but there is no acknowledgement to this either.

## Return to the Crater

The party leaves [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) and the dire wolf behind, heading east uphill towards the crest of the hill where the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) meets [Upper Tresenda](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/upper-tresenda.md) - the bowl shaped valley with the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater at its centre.

Looking into the valley beyond, the mist obscures the location of the crater but [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is able to make it out. The lifeless valley appears exactly as it was.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) casts Mage Armour while Saoirse casts Armour of Agathys. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) casts Dancing Lights to approximate a human shape 100ft ahead of the party in hopes of tricking any creatures into attacking that first.

Saoirse asks the party who she should cast [Sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) on. [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) states that she is able to cast the spell herself and she is already hard to hit, so someone else should be picked. Saoirse asks how the magic within the [Citrine Eye Necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md) can be replenished. Allisa tells her that she is able to do it herself if she has magic to spare.

Allisa offers to guard their rear. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) leads the party down into the valley, keeping an eye out as she covers the 3 miles to the crater at the valley's bottom. As the party arrives near the crater's edge, Saoirse casts Shield of Faith on Torbra.

Torbra spots a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) (the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) disguised as one) two thirds of the way across the crater, the dark grey dirt of the crater floor pushed into a mound suggesting the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) came down at an angle.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) states her intention to approach the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), but is tempered by Saoirse who offers to go first and use her Necrotic Shroud at the first sign of trouble. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) suggests that now is not the time for that as there are no creatures here, but Saoirse retorts that they could teleport and surprise the party. Allisa suggests the party sticks together, but stays somewhat spread out in case of danger. She makes her way around the right hand side of the crater, giving it a wide berth but keeping everyone in view.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) steps into the crater, noticing the dark grey more pulverised gravel under foot (but not realising it is entirely [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md)). Saoirse stays out of the crater, shouting to [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) not to touch it with her bare hands.

Saoirse follows Allisa round to the right hand side of the crater while Torbra enters the crater to follow [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) who is 15ft ahead. Thanea begins heading in the direction of the crater.

## The Crater Stirs

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) takes a hard look at the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) she is approaching. She finds no difference between it and the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), aside from it appearing intact. Looking around it she finds no signs of disturbance, particularly a lack of tracks, as if the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) had just recently landed (the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) has intentionally rearranged the crater floor to make it look enticing). This doesn't concern her, so she proceeds closer. Torbra continues to follow [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), circling around the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). Thanea reaches the crater floor.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s façade turns into a nervous concentration as sweat builds on her brow, something that Thanea notices. The apprehension of having to touch the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) weighing heavy on her mind. She places a hand to it and casts Identify. She receives no magical sensation, suggesting she isn't touching a magical object.

As she retracts her hand, the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) becomes [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) and collapses to the crater floor like a liquid, blending into the ground. Immediately the dark gravel floor does the same, turning into dust and beginning to flow and swirl, picking up speed as the entire crater floor begins to rotate around a point.

Over Torbra's left shoulder on the side of the crater closest to the party's point of arrival, 20ft from her, the centre of this dust vortex begins to rise 5ft into the air, swirling like a miniature tornado. After a moment the dust begins to rise vertically from this point, jumping from its top and falling back down to the crater floor - a constant stream of rising dust. The rising dust begins to take on the shape of a humanoid, with visible arms, legs, and a head, forming the appearance of [Gillian Close](../characters/gillian-close.md) (who died in the crater). Its form never quite stays still, remaining somewhere between flowing grains of dust and a human visage (the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) takes form). Between the dust of its face, two orbs of bright purple light cast erratic light towards the party.

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) was nervously holding Eldritch Blast in anticipation of enemies appearing, so when the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) appears, she lets loose both blasts. As they race across the crater she observes the dust getting kicked up from the force energy, but as they arrive near the mind, both blasts dissipate and no impact or near miss is witnessed (neutralised by the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md)'s anti-magic bubble).

The [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) uses its lair action (Reconfigure) to create two [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) and one [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) from its pool of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) that comprises its form and the crater floor. The party watches as plumes of dust rise up seemingly randomly from the crater floor. As this happens, three of them emerge upwards and leave meteorics in their place.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) charges towards the mind, readying her rapier in case it attacks. She notices the details of its form, spotting its plate armour, cape, and long wavy hair.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Who are you?

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) uses Giant's Might to grow larger before charging to the closest [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) that is also closest to the rest of the party. She swings her halberd twice, hitting it once and scraping against its resistant stone-like surface.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) uses Radiant Soul but stays grounded, backing up out of the crater and its dust.

The [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) in front of Torbra slices down at her but is deflected by Shield of Faith, bending its blade out of her way. Saoirse cheers as she sees her spell save Torbra from damage. The other hunter charges at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), knocking her prone before plunging both of its blades into her chest and wounding her greatly. As this happens she stabs with her prepared rapier and lands a hit, but it barely chips the hunter's hardened skin.

Saoirse moves away from Thanea before using Necrotic Shroud to grow her wings and moving equidistant between Thanea and Allisa.

The floor of the crater begins to surge as the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) pulls towards the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md). Torbra stands her ground and remains upright, but [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) who is already prone gets cut by much of the sharp and hard [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) grains passing over her, beginning to slice at her skin.

The [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) runs across the crater in the direction of Thanea before teleporting to her, slashing with both of its blades, then teleporting back. It hits with one blade, only cutting her slightly.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) raises her staff and points it to a spot behind the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md), casting Fireball. A large floating orb of roiling flame grows in front of the blue gem at her staff's head before she heaves the staff forward, setting it off on its trajectory. As the fireball passes the mind, it fizzles out and vanishes completely, never reaching the ground (neutralised by the anti-magic bubble). Frustrated, Allisa positions herself behind Saoirse.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) gets up as the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) falls from her. She shifts into her Swiftstride form and disengages, rushing to the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) and positioning herself behind it.

Torbra swings her halberd again at the [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) in front of her. Both strikes hit, one critically, dealing a moderate amount of damage. She repositions so that it is between herself and Saoirse.

*[Initiative order paused]*
