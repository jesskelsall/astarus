- The party as a whole is charged 4,000 gp for the death of an [Astornox Guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) in the sewers.

[Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) confers with [Mindira Flibfae](../characters/mindira-flibfae.md) before taking responsibility for the party's actions and paying the full 8,000 gp fine on their behalf.
