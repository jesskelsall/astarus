  - [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md)

## Thanea Reappears

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) leave [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/government/hawks-perch.md), finding [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) on her way to the library herself. Torbra is pleasantly surprised to see her, Saoirse asks where she's been. Thanea expresses disbelief at what she just experienced, retelling her sudden and accidental teleportation to [Supreme Hall](../places/buildings/government/supreme-hall.md) where she had an audience with [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md), General Supreme of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). She was meant to accept the invitation in the evening but misunderstood how it works, so was already on the back foot upon arrival.

Saoirse asks for more details. Thanea explains that he questioned her about her Radiant Soul wings, but wasn't able to discern his motives. She tells the pair that Corville said that her power is never before seen, explaining his interest. She describes him as stoic and scary. Saoirse dismisses her feelings, suggesting that Thanea is impressive and unlikely to be in danger.

Torbra asks what sort of information about herself he asked for. Thanea explains that there were many questions about her origin and history, but she explains that he seemed to already have all of her answers. Following that he asked for a demonstration which she entertained, flying around the room briefly. Saoirse asks if he touched her, Thanea plainly saying no. Saoirse is concerned about a "weird old man" having interest in her.

Thanea tells Saoirse that she did touch him. Saoirse compares it to her mother's work as an escort, but Thanea makes it clear that he wanted her to demonstrate her Healing Hands ability. Thanea talks of the anti-magic field that was present while the party was in [Sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md), drawing comparison to the space in [Supreme Hall](../places/buildings/government/supreme-hall.md). Corville was able to show her that her powers are not affected by this field, suggesting that their nature isn't strictly magical.

As a final addition, Thanea points out that the party should be careful when talking about enemies of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), particularly the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), advising them to avoid any positive sentiments.

Saoirse suggests this may be why [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) was so guarded about his family's origins in the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). She suggests they go and visit Montel and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) in [Lionel's Rest](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/lionels-rest.md), but Torbra explains that the pair have likely already set off towards Iredale, not wishing to hang around in the city.

*[Everyone: long rest x2]*

## Returning to Elysia

Two days later, the party returns to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/settlements/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) to conduct their downtime activities when they are stopped by an [Astorrel member](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md). They inform [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md), [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) that they are needed in [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/government/tenterfell-house.md) today.

Wasting no time, Torbra leads the party there without delay. [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) enters the building and make their way up to the third floor. Torbra knocks on the door. While waiting at the door to the room she can hear [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) engaged in polite conversation with someone:

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> Oh, that's interesting. And what's your personal opinion, do you think they exist?

The conversation stops as Elysia beckons the party inside. Elysia is sat backwards on a dining chair from the right hand side of the centre table, seemingly engaged in conversation with a red skinned tiefling woman ([Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)) sat on the couch next to her. Elysia stands up and welcomes the party back.

She immediately relays information from [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md), expressing that their conversation about the party's failed mission ([Investigate the Humar Meteorite Crater](../storylines/ended/investigate-the-humar-meteorite-crater.md)) didn't go as badly as she expected, but as a result they now need a resounding success on the next mission.

Elysia begins trying to introduce Lucia but stops, asking her about her name:

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> What name are you calling yourself? I'm confused.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> So I'll be travelling with these folks?

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> Indeed, this is [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), your new party.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to you guys.

Elysia explains again that she begrudgingly had to grovel to the major so that they could continue their meteoric work, but now needs "nothing short of perfection" going forward. Torbra tempers her expectations by declaring that a very high standard to meet.

Elysia goes on to explain [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s circumstances, calling it fortuitous that she was "in need of a new squad" when [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) was down a member. Torbra immediately latches onto this, wanting details of her old squad. Elysia deflects the question, refusing to provide a direct answer, suggesting that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) can explain on her own time, before alluding to [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) not being the only problem under the Major of Phenomena right now.

Torbra asks if she will be a liability to the party, causing [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to throw the question back at the party. Saoirse asks if she is likely to jump into a burning fire, confusing and irritating [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) at the suggestion that anyone would be so stupid.

Elysia signals her intention to step aside and give the party a chance to get to know each other.

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> So Torbra, officially yadda yadda, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is now part of [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md).

Elysia goes back to her desk in the back corner of the room. She can be seen writing in one of her books, occasionally glancing up to gauge the new party dynamic.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) introduces herself as the [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md), followed by Thanea and Saoirse. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) remarks that she is being "filed with a bunch of normies", but the party is quick to dismiss such a claim. Saoirse asks if she has accommodation arranged for the night, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) informing her that she does.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> So, what do you think of the horny lesbian?

Torbra glances over to Elysia who didn't hear Saoirse's remark, but meets her gaze as she stares. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) isn't sure who Saoirse is referring to, so Saoirse clarifies. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) gives her a strange look before vocalising her observation that the party is a strange bunch. Saoirse brushes it off as them being in a "funny mood" today.

## Starfall's Next Mission

*See: [Search for a Meteorite in Tresenda Pass](../storylines/search-for-a-meteorite-in-tresenda-pass.md)*

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) turns to [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) and pointedly asks what [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s next mission is. She instructs everyone to gather around the table while she stands up, grabs her copy of the [Astorrel Map of Southeastern Kardan](../maps/astorrel-map-of-southeastern-kardan.md), and unrolls it onto the table, weighing it down with a few scattered books.

Elysia recalls the choice of missions that she provided [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) last time, but informs her that [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md) has forbidden them from returning to the same mission, and that she has already agreed with him what their next mission will be. Saoirse sighs out of frustration of not being able to go back.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) asks Elysia where they can get a new map as the one they were given was destroyed when they jumped into the [River Humar](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md). Elysia tells her that she can requisition a new one for them at a cost of 10 gp, which Thanea pays. Elysia tells her to return in the morning to collect it.

Torbra, frustrated, wonders out loud if they ever got paid for their mission ([Investigate the Humar Meteorite Crater](../storylines/ended/investigate-the-humar-meteorite-crater.md)). Elysia plainly tells her that they failed it, so no.

Elysia begins her mission briefing. She feels that their best bet of success is to [search for a meteorite in Tresenda pass](../storylines/search-for-a-meteorite-in-tresenda-pass.md). [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md)' visions in his scrying bowl (which is still on his desk, in plain view) suggested that one came down there, though it was months ago now. [Astral squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) were able to increase their confidence by cross-referencing maps and speaking to locals, but never had the opportunity to investigate the pass themselves.

She makes it clear that the previous mission bounty still applies: 40 gp each or 50 gp for Torbra, but additionally states her intent to increase the bounty by giving some of her take from the mission. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) makes it clear that she considers this a promise and will be holding Elysia to it. Elysia confirms that it's indeed a promise, and she is happy to be held to it, as she doesn't make promises lightly.

Elysia also alludes to bonus pay for the mission, the specific of which haven't yet been negotiated with Quinn. She reminds the party that returning with [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), or a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) will net them "a sizeable payout", though she suggests due to their previous mission failure, it won't be as much as she would have liked.

When [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) makes a quip about the room being dusty enough as it is, Elysia insists that someone else brings her up to speed on the meteoric threat. Elysia starts by making it clear to [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) that their meteoric research is classified, even within the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md). While she explains what they already know, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) uses Minor Illusion to provide visuals. Elysia shows [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) some [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) in the palm of her hand, which [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) looks at intently. Saoirse tells [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) that "live" dust isn't as safe to touch. Elysia tells [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) of her worst case theory that the meteoric threat could be a weapon developed by the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) to break the armistice.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks for more details of the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md), which sound alien to her. Saoirse and Torbra provide an explanation of their appearance and danger.

Elysia suggests that it'll take the party around a week to reach the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks if there's any transportation that can be provided to speed things up, but Elysia only retorts that they get paid. Elysia suggests travelling through [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md), but also makes mention of the [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) in [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md), where they might be able to find more information about the pass. She regrets to inform the party that she can only offer them 21 days to complete their mission, though she expresses regret that she couldn't offer more. Despite this she does think that they'll have about a week when they get there to investigate as needed, and desperately wishes for them to come back in time or there will be severe consequences for them all, herself included.

Elysia brings the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) over for [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to look at, removing it from the drawstring sack it was kept in behind her desk. She allows [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to investigate it however she wishes, noting that it and the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) isn't allowed to leave the room. Saoirse cautions her not to touch it, telling [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) that the first time she did, she went insane. Elysia confidently places her hand on top of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md).

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> Pretty sure it's fine.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Pretty sure that one's insane anyway.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks what she's looking at exactly. Elysia turns the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), revealing the hatched egg-like hole in the side, suggesting that the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) that [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) encountered emerged from it. Throughout their time with the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), Saoirse doesn't feel any draw to it, the curse on her completely lifted.

Elysia tells [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) that their mission will officially begin tomorrow, so they should take the rest of today to prepare in any way they deem necessary. Saoirse asks if Elysia has another bag they could take with them, so Elysia retrieves another grain bag from her desk drawer, handing it to [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md).

Saoirse asks Torbra what the plan is. Torbra asks if they should depart today or tomorrow, so Thanea insists on waiting until she has a new copy of the map. Torbra agrees. Saoirse asks about travel to [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md), suggesting that there should be plenty of travel options between [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md) and a town on the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md).

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks Elysia about [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md) - what makes heading there worth it on this mission, "aside from it having a nice gate"? Elysia corrects [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), pointing out that [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) is an inn ran by [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) volunteers, that serves as the last stop in western Astor before people venture into the wilderness. She suggests that the people there would be the best source of information on [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) and its goings on, though if they wanted to take a more direct route they could bypass [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md) entirely. Torbra suggests that they should try [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md) as more information won't hurt.

Elysia makes it clear that she doesn't know much about [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) or western Astor in general, but notes that she has heard of a recently recruited [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) ([Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)) from [Filisur](../places/settlements/villages/filisur.md). She finds it remarkable that such a small village could "spit out" someone capable enough to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s ranks. Thanea asks if they're based in [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md). Elysia confirms they are and offers to find out who her [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) is ([Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md)), if the party would like to speak with them in the morning before departing. Thanea feels that more information wouldn't hurt. 

Elysia offers to help them with any other matters in the morning, but suggests they should leave now as she has writing to get back to. The party complies quickly, gathering their things and making for the door.

As [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) leaves, Elysia calls for [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to hang back slightly, moving over to her so the pair can talk quietly:

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> I have my eye on you.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> I hope so.

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> Be careful with this lot. They're not as "normie" as you think they are.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> What's the worst they can do, sprout wings?

Elysia gives [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) a very judgemental look before wrapping up:

*[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md):*
> Take care of yourself.

*[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md):*
> Alright mum, bye.

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) departs [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/government/tenterfell-house.md) with the rest of their day in hand.

## Downtime

With several people having specific errands they wish to run, the party agrees to go their separate ways until sunset. They pick the stone benches by the fountain outside of the [Zenith Spire](../places/buildings/government/zenith-spire.md) as their meeting spot.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) gives [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) 5 gp to buy rations with.

### [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md)

#### [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s Letter

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) makes her way to [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md) and finds a bench to sit on. Once settled she opens [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s letter ([L-PR-04](../letters/L-PR-04.md)). Torbra is saddened by the letter, realising that Heather Pentz still thinks that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is alive. She resolves to show the letter to [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) this evening after they meet up.

#### Library Research

Torbra makes her way back to [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/government/hawks-perch.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/settlements/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), trying to search for mention of the word "genasi", as given to her by [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md). She starts with [Humanoids and Rare Varieties](../items/books/humanoids-and-rare-varieties.md) but finds no reference. Then she remembers that she carries a book, [Humanoids and Rare Varieties](../items/books/humanoids-and-rare-varieties.md). She reads it cover-to-cover but finds no use of the word "genasi".

She expands her search outside of the racial section of the library, looking where [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) was yesterday amongst the theology and rhetoric books. This ends up being a huge rabbit hole of no value to her search, burning several hours of her time.

With Torbra's frustration heard in her sighs and moans, [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md) eventually comes over to her, asking what knowledge she seeks. Torbra recants coming across the story of [Simanelli Tyrol](../characters/simanelli-tyrol.md) as well as the elven word "genasi", lying that her motive for searching for the world is because she enjoys the story so much. Flavian recalls having seen Torbra reading his story and notes being familiar with it. He tells Torbra that he has studied what limited elven text he has been able to get his hands on, but has yet to come across the word "genasi" in what he has read so far.

Flavian talks rhetorically about whether the word is merely not in the literature the pair have read, or if it is fiction, suggesting it is probably the latter. He then tells Torbra that context is important and asks where she came across the word. She tells Flavian that on her travels she came across an elf in need of help, and that they taught her the word. She understands it to mean "people born with inherent gifts".

Flavian picks up on Torbra holding back a bit and presses further, asking if it is akin to [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) or "your angelic companion" ([Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)). Torbra suggests it is more elemental in nature. Flavian leans in closer and quietly speaks to Torbra in a more serious manner:

*[Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md):*
> And what would you do with this knowledge?

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> I suspect someone I know might be one.

*[Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md):*
> And what would you do with *that* knowledge?

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> I need to understand who and what they are before I decide on whether they're a risk.

Flavian hesitates for a moment before leaning in again:

*[Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md):*
> On your way out, place 5 gold on the counter. Come back here before sunrise.

As soon as Flavian finishes speaking his instruction he moves away and returns to his librarian manner of speaking, asking Torbra with a smiley demeanour if there's anything else he can help her with. She thinks not.

Flavian goes back to gathering books from the counter and placing them back on shelves. Torbra places the 5 gp on the counter as asked. As she leaves the building, she looks back to see Flavian place a book on top of the coins to conceal them.

### [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) & [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)

#### Shopping

The pair go shopping together along Crafter's Course.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) helps [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) with buying rations by claiming to be a poor mother in need of food, with her child Thanea. [Nilus Cray](../characters/nilus-cray.md), shopkeeper of [Everything Else](../places/buildings/shops/everything-else.md), notes he is not a charity but gives her two rations for free.

| Character | Item | Price |
| --- | --- | ---:|
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | Ration (day) x22 | - 10 gp |

#### Waiting

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Thanea spend the rest of their downtime sat on a bench outside of the [Zenith Spire](../places/buildings/government/zenith-spire.md), watching other [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) go about their busy days. Thanea tries to strike up conversation with [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to get to know her better, but [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) keeps quiet, making grumpy noises in reaction to someone trying to talk to her.

### [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md)

#### Riddle Answers

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) heads to [the Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) and meets with the innkeeper, [Tydrus Tinshield](../characters/tydrus-tinshield.md). She asks if she can display a poster outside advertising a competition to answer a riddle correctly, with the winner being bought an ale. Tydrus is enamoured by the idea but asks that Saoirse puts up a larger prize in coin, and whatever she puts up he'll match. Saoirse provides 4 gp. Tydrus provides a hinged chalkboard sign from the back room for her to advertise on.

Saoirse takes the chalkboard outside and displays it next to the entrance, writing the following on it:

> GUESS A RIDDLE  
> WIN SOME COIN!  
> 8 gp PRIZE

She sits inside the inn near the entrance, waiting for patrons to come in and try their luck. Unfortunately few people are interested, especially as the mid-morning patrons are few and far between, but she does get several people who try their luck.

The first assumes they will get free money regardless of their answer. When Saoirse corrects them they leave immediately. The second suggests "a pony", to which Saoirse says nobody has ever wanted a pony, causing the patron to attempt to lunge at her, but is grabbed by a dragonborn patron who advises him to move on, avoiding conflict.

By afternoon a variety of patrons take Saoirse up on her riddle, providing her with a variety of answers.

| Riddle answer | Saoirse's response |
| --- | --- |
| A pony | Nobody has ever wanted a pony. |
| Love | My mother used to work in a brothel, I've seen plenty of love go around. |
| Land | Nope |
| Memories | Interesting... |
| The past | |
| Potatoes | |
| Loyalty | A good one... |

By evening, Saoirse hasn't said yes to any of the answers. Tyburn, frustrated by the endeavour, asks if this was a scam or if she got what she wanted. Saoirse says it wasn't, but Tyburn tells her that she's not getting her 4 gp back. He is thankful that several of the patrons who came in stayed for a few drinks.

#### Library Research

Saoirse heads back to [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/government/hawks-perch.md) to research riddles again. With the last hour before dark she continues her research but is unable to find anything of use.

## Meeting at the Fountain

As it begins to get dark around sunset, [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) reconvenes by the fountain outside of the [Zenith Spire](../places/buildings/government/zenith-spire.md).

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) pesters [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) with the riddle provided to her by [Etheldreda Dowsing](../characters/etheldreda-dowsing.md). She responds that she is the answer, obviously. Saoirse tells her off for being full of herself. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks her what the answer is, to which Saoirse explains that "loyalty" is her leading answer, but she doesn't know what the actual answer is. The pair muse over whether "loyalty" fits.

Saoirse asks [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) about her experience with the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md). She reveals that she's been with the organisation for 7 years, keeping her head down and doing her job. She rapidly fires questions at her, learning that the worst thing she's dealt with was her previous squad ([Aura Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/aura-squad.md)), that she can't think of a scary thing that's happened to her, and that she's not had to fight giant crocodiles of "alien-like beasts". Saoirse reveals that a giant crocodile ate [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is dismissive of the notion of crocodiles, which she's only read about before.

Saoirse whispers to [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) will be interesting to adjust to, Torbra sharing the sentiment.

Saoirse then suggests to the party that they grab drinks and chat for the remainder of the evening. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) immediately declines, heading off to her room for the evening. Once she has left, Saoirse comments that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) isn't very sociable, but this gives them an opportunity to openly gossip about her.

## Evening Drinks

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md), and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) head back to [the Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) and enjoy several rounds of ale while talking.

Saoirse asks what the pair think of [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md). Torbra considers her to be quite stuck up, but is willing to see how she is on the road. Saoirse is curious to see what she does with her Lute, suggesting that she might pull it out of her ass. Thanea says she doesn't trust her.

Saoirse laments that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) isn't like [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), which Thanea agrees with. When Thanea suggests she is good at lying, Saoirse is unhappy as she considered herself to be good at lying, taking it competitively.

Saoirse calls [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) a "horny lesbian", but considers a different nickname so as to avoid confusion with [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) who she also uses the nickname on. She calls [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) "frigid bitch". Thanea hopes that they'll be able to get on with [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), particularly as they don't need to be worrying about what will happen to them if they get kicked out of the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) for not getting anything done.

Thanea explains that she bought a bunch of rations and asks what everyone else has done. Saoirse explains that she has plenty of money to buy transport in the morning. Thanea is keen to avoid the disaster of their last mission and wants the squad to be properly prepared. Saoirse hopes that this mission won't end with another party member getting eaten by another giant crocodile.

Saoirse asks if the pair heard [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s answer to her riddle. Saoirse isn't happy, pointing out again that she's completely full of herself. Saoirse says that she misses [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), which Thanea and Torbra agree with.

After three rounds of drinks, the party starts to get tired and goes to bed for the night.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## Dreaming

*See: [Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)*

During the night, all three [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) are given deva dreams by their respective deva. All three [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) snap awake the moment the dream ends. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), drenched in a cold sweat, rockets out of bed screaming.
