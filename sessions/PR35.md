2 dice.

## Danger in the Depths

The giant crocodile rises up out of the surface of the water, opening its large jaws in [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s direction.

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) uses Giant's Might before charging into the water from the lake's edge, trying to get as close to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). She swims through the water in her full armour, feeling it start to pull her under.

The giant crocodile's jaws clamp down around [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s torso, its teeth piercing her skin in multiple places. It maintains its grip, trapping [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) where she is. Having caught it's prey it dives 20ft back into the water, moving to deeper waters.

[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) ushers [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) further away from the lake's shore, the pair running for a while before dropping prone and attempting to hide.

With the crocodile disappearing into the depths of the water, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) loses her view of the creature. She panics and casts Eldritch Blast at where she believes it to be, creating splashes across the surface of the water but missing her mark. She shouts at the party to try and lure it out of the water before moving away from the shore.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) still sees the shadow of the crocodile, so she casts Fire Bolt at it. The ball of fire accidentally skips across the surface of the water, completely missing. As it goes she sees the fire begin to go out, indicating that fire damage won't work well underwater.

As [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tries to struggle free of the crocodile, Saoirse cheers her on, amplifying her voice with Minor Illusion. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) gets free of its teeth before using Hidden Step to become invisible and swimming towards the surface. The crocodile feels her movements through the water, spinning its body and hitting her in the chest with its tail.

*[[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) falls unconscious]*

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s lungs fill with water as falling unconscious causes her to reflexively breathe in.

## Getting [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) Out of the Water

Torbra sees [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) just below the surface of the water, rising while turned on her back. She recognises that she is in trouble, swimming as fast as she can to reach her unconscious body. She activates her Frost Rune to ward herself from the crocodile, and grabs [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), beginning to pull her through the water toward the shoreline.

The giant crocodile rises to the surface again and lunges towards Torbra, clamping its jaw around her, its teeth sinking deep into her hips. Torbra invokes her Stone Rune, charming and incapacitating the crocodile as it succumbs to the rune's magic. While it is unable to do anything, its jaws remain clamped around Torbra.

Montel and Esme continue to cower, moving toward the base of a nearby slope in the terrain. Here they drop prone again and hide once more.

Saoirse returns to the lake's shore and begs her deva to empower her with radiant wings so she can help with [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s rescue (religion check with disadvantage). Thanea uses Restore Balance to even the odds of her success (straight roll) and cheers her on, recognising what she Saoirse is trying to do from her own experiences (inspiration: advantage), doing everything in her power to help out.

- Dice rolls: 2, 3
- Total: 7

[Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) does not hear her. In the process Saoirse uses Necrotic Shroud, causing her sickly black wings to appear. Thanea sees this happen 10ft in front of her, sending a chill down her spine and frightening her. She moves behind Thanea, out of her way.

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Well fuck me.

Thanea screams and runs away from Saoirse towards the tree along the shore line that Torbra is swimming towards. She dashes behind the tree to break her line of sight on Saoirse.

Torbra musters her strength to push her way free of the giant crocodile's jaws. She continues to drag [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) through the water towards the shore, making slow progress due to the weight she is carrying and the water.

While she goes the crocodile manages to resist the magic of her Stone Rune, shaking it off and preparing to strike again.

Saoirse runs over to the shore to her right, away from the part of the shore that Torbra is trying to drag [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) to. She cuts her hand with her dagger before plunging it into the water in an attempt to attract the crocodile to her blood.

Thanea regains her composure. She emerges from behind the tree and moves toward the shore before casting Fireball towards the giant crocodile, aiming just behind it so as not to catch Torbra and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) in the ensuing inferno. The giant ball of fire gently arcs through the air, sailing over [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) as it goes. When it impacts the surface of the water it ignites, engulfing only the crocodile in the fireball. It is able to duck into the water somewhat to avoid much of the damage. As the fireball subsides, Thanea sees the crocodile still in place, seemingly unperturbed.

Torbra continues pulling [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), just about reaching the edge of the lake, moments away from reaching dry ground.

## Revenge of the Giant Crocodile

The giant crocodile turns toward [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) before swimming quickly towards the pair, seemingly gliding through the surface of the water as its legs do all the work. As it arrives it opens its mouth and bites down around [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), spinning its whole body over a full rotation. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is ripped from Torbra's grip and spun over, many of her ribs audibly cracking as she goes. Her midsection bends sideways as her innards are pulverised. As the flip completes her lifeless body smashes back into the water.

*[[Wizira dies](../../storylines/wizira-dies.md)]*

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> No!!

While Torbra is screaming in anguish the giant crocodile spins around and hits her in the back of her head with its tail. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) fires off two Eldritch Blasts at the crocodile, blasting it 20ft across the surface of the water, critically moving it away from Torbra who is reeling from multiple hits.

Montel and Esme start to hear the desperate commotion. They continue to hide out of fear. While making her way towards Torbra and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md), Saoirse desperately shouts at Montel, asking him if he possesses any healing magic. He replies that he doesn't.

Thanea uses Radiant Soul to take flight, heading into the air and putting a bit of distance between her and the shoreline. Torbra grabs [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s body and pulls them both out of the water towards the tree. The crocodile follows them, biting down on [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s body again, yanking her away from Torbra and turning back into the lake, indicating its desire to take her corpse and leave.

Saoirse blasts the crocodile with Eldritch Blast, hoping to dislodge [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) from it. It takes the first blast squarely but its grip remains vice-like. She continues to advance toward Torbra. Thanea casts Scorching Ray at 2nd level, hitting the crocodile twice in its back. It tenses up as it briefly reels from the hits, showing its injuries as it bleeds from its wounds.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Burn, you abomination.

Torbra snaps, running to the crocodile with murderous intent. She swings down hard with her halberd, hitting it twice on the top of its neck, breaching its leathery hide and hitting something softer, squelching blood onto her. She reacts by screaming in agony.

## Taking Its Prey and Going Home

The giant crocodile continues moving to the water's edge, intent on fleeing with [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s body. Torbra takes another swing at it but fails to catch it as it goes. The crocodile begins to dive as it goes, disappearing 15ft below the water before trying to hide, remaining still as it starts to disappear into the murky depths.

Saoirse gives up, dropping to her knees and sobbing. The entire experience overwhelms her and she is unable to continue fighting. Thanea's will remains strong. She takes flight over the edge of the lake, casting Magic Missile on the crocodile that she can still spot due to its blood streaking through the water. As the darts plunge into the water and impact it, she inflicts painful wounds but is unable to finish her foe (4/96 HP).

Torbra rushes into the water to try and chase it, seething and refusing to give up. It begins to dawn on her that she can't catch a creature so well adapted to the water.

The giant crocodile disappears into the depths of the lake with [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s body.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## Overcome with Grief

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) gives up and slams the water in frustration. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) lands and deactivates her wings, frustrated and saddened by [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s death. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) throws several Eldritch Blasts into the water out of frustration, crying out even harder in anguish.

Thanea makes her way over to Saoirse and puts her hand on her shoulder.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> You can stop. It's over.

Torbra emerges from the water and makes her way over to the tree, headbutting it while staring at the ground. She turns around and slumps down against it before beginning to cry.

[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md), sensing that the fight is over, re-emerge and return to the party. Montel has a look of fear on his colour drained face while Esme is crying. The pair are reeling from the general danger of combat. Esme is crying sympathetically to her father's emotions, not grasping what is going on.

Montel apologises almost wordlessly, regretting not being able to help. Thanea and Saoirse reassure him that it wasn't his fault, especially as he had been asked to hide.

As Torbra gets up and walks back over to the party she stumbles across [Wizira's Staff](../items/wiziras-staff.md) on the shoreline, the head of the staff resting against the shore while its base is partially submerged. Her jaw drops. She runs over and grabs it, a now sacred reminder of their fallen friend. She takes it back to the party and shows it to them.

Torbra, Thanea, and Saoirse embrace for a moment. While they do Esme comes over and puts her arms around Torbra's leg, trying to share in the moment. She looks terrified and anguished, taking emotional cues from everyone else. Torbra sits down and places her in her lap, doing her best to put on a brave smile. Esme takes a moment to look around at everyone before speaking to Torbra:

*[Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md):*
> Torbra, where's [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)?

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> She's... she's gone.

*[Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md), to [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> Just like mum?

The brave façade leaves Montel in an instant as all of the pain he is feeling comes to the surface. He opens his mouth to say "yes" but no sound comes out.
