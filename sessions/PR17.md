## Emerging Into the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md)

As the party emerges from the sewer under the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) into the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md), 6 [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) including an [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) ([Tonnol Grisham](../characters/tonnol-grisham.md)) emerge from the nearby gatehouse and proceed towards them at a sprint.

## [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s Distraction

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) exclaims that she has the situation under control, urging the party to go on without her. [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) needs no invitation, indicating that the rest of them should head in the opposite direction from the guards. Everyone else runs after him as soon as they're out of the sewers and are able to.

*[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md), to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md):*

> Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Disguise Self to give the impression of a 1ft taller angry looking orc, adding animalistic growling sounds using Druidcraft. Her efforts are indeed intimidating, causing the group of guards to stop momentarily. One guard flees back through the gatehouse before the [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) urges the rest to resume their chase. At this point they are 20ft from [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).

As the chase resumes, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) holds Hidden Step for the moment the guards get close enough, disappearing from sight as two guards attempt to grab her. One falls to the floor while the other gets a hand on her but is easily shaken off. During this chaos [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) begins running away in a similar direction to the party. After 6 second she becomes visible again, the guards quickly spotting her and resuming their chase.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) ducks around a corner and attempts to hide. One guard spots her and the group gives chase, now around 10ft behind her. She runs away again down a different street, pulling a bit of a gap from them. Once again she dives into a side street and tries to hide. This time 2 guards round the corner, looking intently for her and at one point passing her, before heading back to regroup.

Around this time [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) hears the large bell on each guard tower on the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) begin to ring.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) holds position while the guards search the surrounding area. Eventually she hears them regroup and discuss their next steps, before they move off and the nearby street falls silent.

She uses Wild Shape to transform into a black cat before climbing up onto the building next to her. From here she can see both spires of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) including the [Zenith Spire](../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md), and an open area between her and it ([Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md)). She runs along the uniform terraced rooftops in its direction until she reaches the square.

## Everyone Else Runs

While this is happening, the rest of the party run down the street running alongside the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) before turning left onto a long straight cobbled street that continues into the lamp lit darkness for about 300ft. They sprint down this street in an attempt to lose the guards. As they're all busy pursuing [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), none give chase.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) casts Expeditious Retreat to make it easier for her to run away without tiring herself out. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts False Life on herself in case they get into trouble.

Around this time the party hears the large bell on each guard tower on the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) begin to ring.

## [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md)

The party minus [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) reaches the end of the road which emerges into [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md). Across the square Sparrow spots the street that leads towards [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street, which in turn will lead them into the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md). As he is unable to discern whether there are guards in the square due to it being dark, he cautions that they should go around rather than across.

Looking around, the party spots an alley 40ft back along their street which they could use.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) spots the party one street over through an alley that she can see through. She meows, catching [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md)'s keen ears, who informs the rest of the party. The party is initially sceptical that it's [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), but Sparrow recognises their cat form from her demonstration in [Ulburn Astorrel House](../places/buildings/ulburn-astorrel-house.md). [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) leaps from the roof safely and reconvenes with the party.

The party begins making their way anti-clockwise around [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md) by way of [the alleys](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md), checking each street before the party all darts across it at once.

At this point the party aren't as stealthy as they thought, making noise and drawing visual attention to them. While crossing the fourth street two [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) notice them and shout at them in exclamation. The party breaks into a sprint, once again fleeing from the guards.

They hear the guards shouting at each other as they run. One guard saw the group and has taken off by himself, with the other trying to catch up and figure out what's going on. They are 40ft back from the party.

The party begins to pull away from the guards. Suddenly the second guard peels off to go and get reinforcements, disappearing from the party's view in a moment where they're not actively looking.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) casts Eldritch Blast at the remaining guard. The blast connects, dealing 7 force damage, throwing him 10ft backwards. She sees him lying on his back in the street before continuing on.

As [the alleys](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) end, the party reaches the street that Sparrow pointed at from the other edge of [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md). He checks for guards on the street and sees a volume of [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) in the square itself. He advises a quick but stealthy approach, encouraging the party by explaining that they're nearly there.

Following Sparrow's lead, the party moves onto the street in a stealthy manner. Once again they aren't as subtle as they would have liked. After proceeding for 30ft they hear the shouting of four [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) from [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md) behind them. For the third time the party flees along the street. With a head start, the party pull away from their new pursuers.

## [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street

Running up the street away from the square, the party arrives at a crossroad. Sparrow points to the left and rounds the corner in that direction:

*[Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md):*

> We're nearly there! Just down this street.

Looking back the party sees 2 [Astornox Guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) and 2 [Astornox Guard Corporals](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-corporal.md) running after them.

They follow Sparrow round the corner onto [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street, seeing a long street with buildings on both sides, lit by magical street lamps. It appears to be a dead end. Sparrow looks confused, alternating between looking down the street and at the party.

*[Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md):*

> What trickery is this? This is not a dead end!

At the end of the street is a building perpendicular to the road. The party watches as out from the brickwork of the building, two figures ([Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) and [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md)) emerge, phasing through the Greater Illusion of a building that has been placed in the road.

*[Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md):*

> Oh, that explains it. It is trickery! The stronghold is just on the other side of this. Go! I hold them off!

## Cornered by the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) Hunters

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) immediately climbs onto the building to his left, dashing along it and getting into a position that overlooks the middle of the street.

[Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) moves up before letting loose an arrow from his short bow at [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md). It strikes her, injuring her notably and causing her to lose her concentration on Major Illusion. The building blocking the street dissipates. The party can now see the gatehouse of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) 30ft behind it.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) follows Sparrow's lead, casting Magic Missile, targeting Vilnia exclusively. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), still in cat form, climbs onto the building next to her (opposite side of the street from Kur), running along it and leaping down to a lower rooftop.

The 4 guards giving pursuit emerge around the corner and attempt to spread out and grab those in the street. One passes Torbra on their way to [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) / Sparrow. As they pass by Torbra, she takes an attack of opportunity, lunging at him with her halberd, drawing blood.

As a second guard moves into position between Torbra and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md), Torbra once again swings at the first guard, slicing him open just below his collar bone, killing him. She immediately spins and slashes at the second guard, drawing blood.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) uses Fey Presence in an attempt to charm the 2 remaining guards near Torbra and her, but only succeeds in charming Torbra. She then runs down the street, the second guard taking an opportunistic swipe at her with their sword but missing.

Vilnia walks forward purposefully, casting Suggestion on [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md):

*[Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md):*

> Be a dear, lay down and let the guards shackle you.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) manages to resist the spell's effect.

Kur is enraged that Sparrow has openly attacked Vilnia. In retaliation he casts Lightning Bolt at 3rd level towards Sparrow, who fails their dexterity saving throw, taking the full brunt of the electricity. They immediately fall unconscious. Kur jumps off the roof, looking to engage the party up close.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts Magic Missile at 2nd level, again fully at Vilnia. She succumbs to her third attack and falls unconscious. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) runs to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s roof and climbs up onto it. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) drops Wild Shape then casts Ice Knife at Kur.

The guards already on the scene begin surrounding Torbra and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md), attempting to grab them, but not succeeding. Torbra continues attacking the guards, landing a significant blow on one of the [Astornox Guard Corporals](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-corporal.md) who starts bleeding heavily.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) casts Expeditious Retreat, rushing over to aid Sparrow.

Vilnia succeeds on her death saving throw with a natural 20, returning to consciousness with 1 hit point. Kur casts Scorching Ray at 2nd level, with metamagic to make it lightning damage, spreading their rays between [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md), [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). All 4 of the rays miss. They then use metamagic to attack again, casting Scorching Ray again at the same 3 party members, doing damage to all 3 this time.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts Magic Missile at 1st level, targeting Kur except for 1 dart which hits Vilnia, knocking her unconscious again. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Ice Knife at Kur, dealing max damage on 3d6, knocking Kur unconscious.

The guard closest to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) lunges at her, managing to grab hold of her. The bloodied guard corporal that Torbra attacked retaliates, dealing a critical hit, inflicting a solid strike against her.

More [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) come rushing around the corner onto [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street: 2 [Astornox Guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md), 2 [Astornox Guard Corporals](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-corporal.md), and 1 [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md). Most of them immediately envelop Torbra, seeing an unconscious [Astornox guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) on the floor next to her. One of the guard corporals and the guard sergeant make their way over more slowly, watching how the fight develops. Torbra immediately disengages, running down the street towards the rest of the party.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) uses Healing Hands on Sparrow, restoring them to consciousness. He immediately gets to his feet and starts helping pry [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) from the [Astornox guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md)'s grip.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) uses her metamagic to regain a 2nd level spell slot and puts it to immediate use, casting Sleep at 2nd level on the group of guards that were trying to grab Torbra. She succeeds in putting 2 [Astornox Guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) and 1 [Astornox Guard Corporal](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-corporal.md) to sleep, before hopping off the roof.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) follows up [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)'s spell with one of her own. She casts Entangle in the middle of the group of guards, only succeeding in restraining the guards already asleep. She leaps from one building to the next, barely making it.

The guard that has been trading blows with Torbra catches up with her and takes another swing. The guard grappling [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) succeeds in restraining her. With the help of Sparrow, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) then succeeds in struggling free from the guard. She takes off at unnatural speed, making it half way to the gatehouse under the effect of Expeditious Retreat.

Sparrow tries to cast Infestation at the closest guard, but they're able to bat his wasps away. With that, he turns tail and runs towards the gatehouse. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Ice Knife on the 2 guards closest forward, injuring them both with the explosion of ice.

The party continues running down the street away from the guards. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) continues running along the rooftop for as long as she can before climbing down in front of the gatehouse.

Torbra at the back of the pack continues to be pursued by 2 [Astornox Guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) and 2 [Astornox Guard Corporals](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-corporal.md). She moves away from them, taking a slice from a sword as she goes, but is able to dash away.

While the party is moving beyond where [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) and [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) lie, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) doubles back to kick Kur in the chest, not kicking him hard enough to do him harm. She then continues running towards the gatehouse.

*[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md):*

> Stupid lightning ball weirdo.

Eventually the party begins crossing the threshold into the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) gatehouse tunnel, beyond the 2 [Astorrel Guards](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) standing guard.

An [Astornox Guard Corporal](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-corporal.md) stabilises [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) while the [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) moves up to the now dead body of [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md). [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) looks back to see Kur receiving aid, opting to cast Eldritch Blast at him which knocks him unconscious almost as soon as he was woken up by the guard administering aid.

Torbra is the last to arrive at the gatehouse. As she arrives, she moons at the last 2 pursuing guards who stop 20ft short of the gatehouse, knowing they are unable to proceed without causing an incident between the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

## Reaching the Gatehouse

The party looks back, observing the street that they've fled through. They see [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) once again receiving medical aid while the [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) tries to resuscitate [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md), eventually giving up and stepping away from her body in resignation.
