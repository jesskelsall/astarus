## Introduction: [Kardan](../places/continents/kardan.md), Astor, [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md)

> Our story begins on the continent of [Kardan](../places/continents/kardan.md), where its south east coast meets the [Sea of Songs](../places/seas/sea-of-songs.md). Here the mountains flank the land, but between them fertile plains, winding rivers and forests have given life its best start in this place. The summers are warm, winters are mild, and a strong breeze blows in from the sea.
>
> A little over 300 years ago, this land became a place with the founding of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) - the first real civilisation in this land. Astor is strong, powerful, and militaristic. Its military rules with an iron fist, and the general supreme rules with power absolute.
>
> Magic is a rare blessing in this world, though many see it as a curse. The military, known as the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), has standing orders to capture any [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) so that they can be conscripted into their ranks. They encouraged to do this by rewards of rank and gold, and so [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) are hunted ferociously. [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) can try to hide, but those who harbour them will face the wrath of the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) if they do.
>
> In [northern Astor](../places/regions/northern-astor.md), along the [northern road](../places/roads/northern-road.md), lies the town of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md). It is the last town on this road before exiting the kingdom into the mountains beyond, and sits at a crossroad that connects many other settlements to the rest of the kingdom. It is surrounded by plains ideal for farming, with forests further to the east and west.
>
> Two nights ago, on a clear starry late summer’s night, a white streak flashed across the sky - a meteor. It was witnessed by many in the area, who saw it crash to the earth. Word has gotten around that it impacted near [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md). And so, many people have descended on the town, used to large numbers of travelers passing through, but never this many.
>
> Our story begins two days after the meteor landed, late afternoon. The sun is halfway to setting, bathing the land in a warm summer’s glow. A light breeze blows fluffy white clouds across the sky, providing shade that serves as a welcome break from the heat.
>
> It is on this summer’s afternoon that our story truly begins.

## Introduction: [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)

*See: [Wizira's Father Goes Missing](../storylines/wiziras-father-goes-missing.md)*

> Down one of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md)’s many streets lies a botany store, [Heather & Horticulture](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/heather-and-horticulture.md). It is the place to go for anyone seeking herbal remedies, plants, flowers or gardening supplies. The store and its owner, Heather Pentz, are well known in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), especially amongst the wealthy landowners who can afford to keep plants to make their gardens look pretty.
>
> But what isn’t well known, or known to anyone else, is the courtyard behind the shop. It is a literal secret garden. The two storey buildings enveloping it have no view into it, and their owners presume this place is just dead space, as it once was.
>
> Now it’s a paradise away from the noise and filth of the town. Every inch is full of flowers, plants, herbs, fruits and vegetables, growing happily in the sun that they get throughout the day. Even by the buildings where the sun’s life giving energy is at its scarcest do plants that prefer the dim and damp thrive.
>
> Strangely shaped stones crisscross the courtyard, forming makeshift paths that can be used to get about, tend, and gather.
>
> The garden is immaculate - clearly well kept. Nothing grows here that wasn’t meant to. Every plant is well watered despite the need to bring the water in from outside. The sound of bees buzzing in the afternoon sun and the birds chirping from the roof can be heard clearly in this quiet nook.
>
> The only other person who knows about this place is here right now, sitting on one of the stones, the beauty of the place lost on them in this moment.

Heather Pentz enters the garden through the door from her shop. She asks [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) what is wrong.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) explains that her father has gone missing from their home and she’s not been able to find him anywhere. She came here to ask Heather what is going on in the town.

Heather offered her condolences and wasn’t much help, but gave [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) 1 gp to buy something nice from the market in order to help take her mind off events. She also suggested asking the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) as they would know of anything strange going on, but advised caution when dealing with them. Alternatively, people in the market or [The Slippery Weasel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md) might be able to help.

She left to go visit the market.

## Introduction: [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) & [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)

*See: [Crossing Paths in Goldreach](../storylines/crossing-paths-in-goldreach.md)*

> Meanwhile, on the south edge of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), a cart drawn by two horses pulls off the [northern road](../places/roads/northern-road.md). It has been riding from the small town of Grasthwaite for the last two days, and has finally reached its stop.
>
>Pulling off the road, it makes its way over to the [Goldreach stables](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/goldreach-stables.md), a large wooden structure purpose built to give travellers and their horses somewhere to stop before proceeding into town on foot.
>
> There is lots of activity here. The rider curses under his breath as it becomes apparent that there might not be enough space for him to store his cart and horses for the night, something he’s not had trouble with before.
>
> “Bugger! You lot might as well get off now. Hope you enjoy [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md)! Head down that street and you’ll find the inn, [The Slippery Weasel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md), on the other side of the marketplace. Can’t miss it!”
>
> As instructed, his two passengers hop off the back of the cart and assess their surroundings. They’ve kept to themselves on the journey, but finally they’ve both arrived.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) hop off the cart and make their way towards the market, separately. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) initially tails [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md).

## The Marketplace

[Goldreach Marketplace](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/goldreach-marketplace.md) is packed and it’s hard to move. The market is busy with crowds and the stalls are surrounded by customers browsing their wares. It’s hard to see across the marketplace for everyone that’s there.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) immediately seeks to pickpocket someone and finds a man propped up against one of the closest market stalls, about to fall asleep. She bumps into him and pulls coins out of his pocket as she does so. He doesn’t notice, and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) pockets 2 cp.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) makes her way round the edge of the market past the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) HQ and finds [The Slippery Weasel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md) with a crowd outside. She asks someone and finds out that the crowd are drunken revelers around the entrance to the inn.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) moves deeper into the crowd trying to find a food stand and bumps into [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), knocking her over. When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) stands back up by herself she realises that the gold coin in her pocket has disappeared. She searches for the gold coin on her hands and knees and eventually finds it, deeper into the market. While this is happening, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) ties someone’s shoelaces over to trip them up.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) finds a food vendor selling pork slices in bread. She dirties her face and pleads with the vendor to give her something for 1 cp and is able to persuade them to make her a smaller sandwich with the off-cuts of meat.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) proceeds into [The Slippery Weasel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md). [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks some people standing having a conversation about where to ask about missing persons and is directed to the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) HQ. She instead decides to follow [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) into the inn.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) makes her way over to the entrance to [The Slippery Weasel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md) and follows [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) inside. They get drinks and sit on the only free table, which had just cleared out. Once [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) arrives she joins them. They sit apart and keep to themselves. Torbra checks her equipment.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) searches the crowd for someone who looks like they can help. Eventually she finds [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) in jovial conversation at a full table and decides to approach him.

## [Alistair Hawthorn](../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md) Enters

After a while, [Alistair Hawthorn](../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md) enters the inn, causing the room to go deathly silent, everyone’s attention on him. He gives a proclamation:

> By the power of Corville Thornox, General Supreme of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), I, [Alistair Hawthorn](../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md), Captain of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) have been charged with apprehending any known [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) in this town, and bringing to justice any who would harbour them.
>
> In the last two days we’ve put 3 [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) in the cells. Better to offer yourselves up willingly now than get hunted down later - [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) will inevitably find you.

A patron near the front of the inn shoots up from the table and bolts for the door, running right past Alistair. He doesn’t flinch or even look at him. The patron is taken into custody the moment he leaves the front door by the guards waiting outside.

> I guess that makes four. As you were.

Alistair begins walking around the inn, observing those inside. Periodically he goes up to a table and converses with the people there before moving on.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) moves to the back of the inn near the stairs and stands against the wall, right next to the table the rest of the party are sat at.


Eventually Alistair arrives at their table. He asks each person in turn what their business here is, and insight checks several party members to see if they're being truthful, but is unable to tell and chooses to believe them.

| Character | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) | Passing through, visiting her grandma in the next village. |
| [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) | An alchemist & herbalist visiting town for supplies. |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | Passing through, searching for a wise sage. |
| [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) | From out of town, here to stock up on supplies. |

## [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) Visits

*See: [Finding the Goldreach Meteorite](../storylines/finding-the-goldreach-meteorite.md)*

[Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) comes over to the party’s table and takes a stool. He asks them if they've heard anything about the meteor. When they say they've not, he talks excitedly about it, explaining that he's here looking for it so that he can study it.

Elaborating further, he explains that he's from [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) and has had a particular interest in meteorites recently, outside of his usual expertise in magic, and illusion magic specifically.

When [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) cautions Wrenn on speaking loudly about being interested in magic, Wrenn taps on his [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) military badge and explains that it's fine.

Wrenn then offers up to 50 gp to the party if they're able to bring him information about the meteorite, with the full amount available if the meteorite itself can be returned to him. He also warns the party that he has made this offer to others already, so they need to be proactive if they want to earn.

When the group is hesitant to accept, Wrenn explains that he is staying at 12 [Flute Street](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/flute-street.md) ([Alistair Hawthorn's House](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/alistair-hawthorns-house.md)), and they should meet him there to accept.

Torbra asks more probing questions about Wrenn's thirst for knowledge, inquiring about where he sources his materials. Wrenn indicates that he has access to a large library in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) that's only available to [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) like himself. Torbra agrees to work for him if he's able to provide Torbra with information from the library.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) gives Wrenn a false name: Aria O'Leary.

Wrenn casts Detect Magic while looking at [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), immediately recognising her as a firbolg. Due to her affinity for nature, Wrenn blackmails her into helping him, otherwise he will turn her in to the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). He does this begrudgingly, explaining that not all [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are bad.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tells Wrenn that her father disappeared from their home yesterday evening. Wrenn vaguely indicates that he might be able to help if [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) helps him with the meteorite.

Wrenn leaves the table with a grin on his face. He walks over to Alistair by the front door, converses with him briefly, and points towards the party. Alistair looks towards the party, and then they both leave together.

## A Place to Sleep

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) darts out of [The Slippery Weasel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md) in a hurry and walks quickly back towards her home on the edge of [Hawkswood North East](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-north-east.md).

[Sammal Guntos](../characters/sammal-guntos.md) informs the party that the inn is full for the night. He explains that the [Four Scythes Inn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/four-scythes-inn.md) may have space, and that the Holyrooks have advertised space at [Holyrook Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/holyrook-farm.md) and to mention his name if they go.

The party make their way towards the farm and catch up with [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) on the road heading to the farm. They make brief conversation with her before she continues to her house on the edge of the forest, which she reaches within a few hours with ease.
[Holyrook Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/holyrook-farm.md)
The party knocks on the door of the farm house and are greeted by Darien Holyrook. He offers them lodging for the night in the barn for 1 sp total, and breakfast in the morning for another 1 sp total.

An attempt to haggle down the price fails as the Holyrooks need the money, Darien instead offering help with the cows in exchange for a lower price, before [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) offers to pay the full 2 sp for everyone. Darien looks surprised that the party paid the full amount.

They are shown to the barn and told to keep away from the cows and to keep the barn door closed. They find a comfortable spot at the back to set up their beds and fall asleep.
