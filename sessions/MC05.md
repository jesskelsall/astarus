## An Alley Ambush

After being lead into a building courtyard in [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) by [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md), [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) are surprised when [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) and [Viola](../characters/viola.md) draw their weapons, intent on attacking the pair of [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md).

*[Initiative order begins]*

As [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) draws a dagger on him, [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) shouts to the pair, pleading that this situation doesn't have to involve violence. [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) hesitates, looking over at [Viola](../characters/viola.md) for guidance on how to proceed. She holds her action.

[Viola](../characters/viola.md) responds, saying the bounty on them is too high to ignore, and that it's nothing personal. [Viola](../characters/viola.md) lunges at Marik with her mace, striking her in the chest. This prompts [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) to stab Kera, combat beginning proper.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) retaliates by drawing his [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) longsword and cutting [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) down, felling the kenku in one well placed hit. [Viola](../characters/viola.md) looks on as she collapses to the floor motionless. Kera tells [Viola](../characters/viola.md) to stop or he'll finish [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md), a chilling statement of intent that shocks both [Viola](../characters/viola.md) and Marik.

[Viola](../characters/viola.md) hesitates for a moment but doubles down, striking Marik again. Kera wastes no time following through on their promise, stabbing into [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) while they are down (2 death save failures). Feeling a strong sense of dread, [Viola](../characters/viola.md) gives up, a wash of fear overtaking her face. She drops her mace immediately, raising her hands to give up.

Marik tells [Viola](../characters/viola.md) that if they cooperate and explain why the pair were trying to kill Marik and Kera, they'll use their magic to save [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md)'s life. [Viola](../characters/viola.md) agrees but shouts desperately at Marik to do something now as she's lying in an increasingly large pool of blood. Marik casts Healing Word on [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) but nothing happens. As Marik realises that healing magic failing to bring someone back to consciousness has grave implications, everyone realises that [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) is dead.

*[Initiative order ends]*

Marik pushes [Viola](../characters/viola.md) to her knees, who keeps her hands in the air in surrender. [Viola](../characters/viola.md), now panicked and fearing for her life, nervously rambles about how the pair killing [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) makes them even, and how their business is concluded, which means she is free to go... right?

*[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md):*
> We should kill her.

*[Initiative order begins]*

The colour drains from [Viola](../characters/viola.md)'s face as she decides to flee. She jumps to her feet and tries to escape through the gate, into [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md). [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) moves into the spot the open gate occupies in order to body block her. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) rushes over, longsword still in hand. As [Viola](../characters/viola.md) squeezes past Marik and darts into [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) beyond, Kera slashes at her, wounding her deeply.

[Viola](../characters/viola.md) begins to flee down [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) in the direction that Marik and Kera came from. Marik gives chase, casting Produce Flame at her, scorching the back of her head. Barely clinging to consciousness, [Viola](../characters/viola.md) stumbles further, running for her life. Kera barges past Marik, just about closing the gap before connecting with [Viola](../characters/viola.md) with a Goring Rush. He lowers his head and sinks his horns into her back, one horn going under her shoulder blade. The force from the blow pushes her against [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) wall, her unconscious body crumpling to the ground.

*[Initiative order ends]*

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) wastes no time using his longsword to finish off [Viola](../characters/viola.md), plunging it into her several times to ensure her demise. Doing so splashes blood across his face.

Shocked by the finality of the encounter, the pair resolve to tidy up the mess as best as they can. Their bodies are searched, Marik receiving 8 gp and 2 day rations from [Viola](../characters/viola.md), but finding only a collection of small rocks in [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md)'s pockets.

Both bodies are moved into the courtyard and piled in the corner containing the empty chest. Marik looks through the grimy window of the connected house, finding an unremarkable kitchen of someone's house. She feels it is unlikely that the pair of [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) will have used the house.

Kera takes off his armour and wipes the blood from his face. The pair are confident that there are no prying eyes or sounds of danger approaching from beyond [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md), so they clean off their blades on their foes' clothing before nonchalantly emerging from [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md).

## Skimmer Errands

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) return to [Nomad's Stop](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/nomads-stop.md) to clean up, spending 1 sp each to use the wash facilities. They clean all of the blood from their gear, keeping it away from prying eyes and the [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md).

Once done they spend some time throughout the afternoon doing some shopping to buy and sell supplies.

### Thieves' Tools

Marik looks to buy a set of thieves' tools. Due to the bounty still on their head (word from [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) in [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) yet to reach [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md)), she opts to avoid finding a [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) contact in [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) to buy a set from, instead searching in local businesses. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) offers to come with her, with a plan to help reveal the existence of the tools in the possession of a business owner. He uses the set of manacles he owns, placing himself in them, telling Marik to pretend he got stuck and that they need help freeing him.

The pair walk into a general store near [Nomad's Stop](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/nomads-stop.md) and ask the shopkeeper for his assistance. He is deeply suspicious of the pair, vocalising that he is considering finding some nearby [Coastguards](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md) who will be able to help them. His concern is that they are escaped prisoners. Marik convinces him to help. He takes out a lock picking set from somewhere below his counter, offering his lock picking services for 1 gp.

Marik makes it clear that she would like to buy the whole set. While picking the lock he offers it for 30 gp, above the price Marik is familiar with. She tries to haggle him down to 20 gp but he will only go as far as 28 gp. When she presses harder, he increases his price.

*Shopkeeper:*
> Actually, it seems like there's quite a lot of demand for these tools right now, so unfortunately the price has gone up. 30 gp.

Marik gets frustrated at her lack of progress in negotiating and gives in, slamming 30 gp down on the counter. The shopkeeper collects his tools together and places them on the counter subtly while scooping the money into his hands.

*[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md), under her breath:*
> Fuck you.

*Shopkeeper, with a smile:*
> Fuck you very much, have a wonderful day!

### Weapons

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) locates an armoursmith, looking to sell the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) longsword given to the party by [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md). The armoursmith doesn't recognise the origin of the sword, but finds it of good quality, offering the market price for it.

Kera also sells a light crossbow, crossbow bolt case and its bolts to the general store.

### Afterwards

The pair return to [Nomad's Stop](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/nomads-stop.md) where they retire for the evening, partaking in several rounds of ales. They honour [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md)'s instructions and wait patiently for their return that evening.

## [Nacnar's House](../places/buildings/houses/nacnars-house.md)

Earlier that same day, [Nacnar Morwesyrr](../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md) leads [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) out of [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md), down through the streets of [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md), to her house. They head down through the town and across to the east, eventually arriving in a small alley. Up a flight of steps alongside the building is [Nacnar's House](../places/buildings/houses/nacnars-house.md).

Nacnar instructs the pair to wait a moment while she opens up. Unlocking the front door she heads inside, closing the door behind her. Out of sight of the pair she disarms the traps in the porch before opening the front door again, ushering the pair inside. Vētrall and Valan join Nacnar in the first room, a dining room with a 6 seater table at its centre.

Nacnar asks Vētrall what they wanted to talk about in private. Vētrall begins pacing and explodes into a panicked rant, recanting the events of the last few weeks, from the moment they received a letter from [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) ([L-MC-06](../letters/L-MC-06.md)) that culminated in them securing [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md). They call the sphere cursed, due to how many bad things have happened since they acquired it. During this rant Vētrall mentioned being on the run from [Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md), getting teleported to the desert, and associating with would-be thieves. They also place emphasis on their ruined shirt, a consequence of their time in the [Kas'ran Desert](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/kasran-desert.md).

Nacnar allows Vētrall to rant start to finish, listening intently, her face barely changing through its twists and turns. Valan listens too, letting the situation play out. At one point he pulls out a baked potato from his kit and eats it while listening.

Once Vētrall is done, Nacnar coaches them through breathing exercises to help bring them back to a calmer state, something Vētrall appreciated. Nacnar calmly begins to dissect everything they have said, starting with the more troubling aspects. Asking about the [Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) searching for them, Vētrall explains that what they possess is supposedly an artifact of Chausain. Nacnar agrees that this would be something the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) would be after.

When Nacnar asks for more specifics of the item, Vētrall offers the letter to her so she can see it for herself, but as Vētrall paraphrased Geen's desire for them to keep this to themself, Nacnar refuses to take it, telling Vētrall that they must honour the trust that Geen has placed in them.

Vētrall asks Nacnar if they know anything about [memory spheres](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md), but Nacnar makes it clear that she has no idea what they even are.

Nacnar then asks Vētrall what they want to do, choosing to focus on what comes next rather than what's happened. Despite the misfortune the sphere has visited upon them, Vētrall wants to do honour the faith [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) put in them and finish uncovering the mystery of this [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md), finishing his work and providing him closure. Nacnar finds this to be an honourable ideal, but doesn't voice an opinion either way, allowing Vētrall freedom to decide for themself.

Vētrall asks if Raine knows anyone called Raine ([Raine Soulier](../characters/raine-soulier.md)) who is based in [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md). Nacnar doesn't, but points them in the direction of [Disanz Brickbrow](../characters/disanz-brickbrow.md), a dwarf woman who lives in [Hochwald](../places/settlements/cities/hochwald.md). She explains that they'll find word of her by searching in the city's inns due to her reputation as a heavy drinker. Nacnar explains that she might be able to help locate someone, but offers no assurances. Nonetheless Vētrall is thankful. They cheekily probe the nature of their relationship but Nacnar is tight lipped.

## A Parting Gift

Nacnar then reluctantly points out to Vētrall that she can't join them on their quest for answers, saying that it won't be long before she retires from adventuring. When Vētrall asks why, she explains that she's been an adventurer for over 100 years and the physicality of the lifestyle is taking its toll on her body. [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) vocally relates without giving any deals as to why.

Vētrall is saddened by the news, mostly the idea of Nacnar calling it quits. Nacnar tries to move the conversation away from that, explaining that they also have some business elsewhere to attend to. In any case, they can likely find [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members willing to help them at [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md).

*[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md):*
> I don't suppose you're willing to tell me what sort of business it is?

*[Nacnar Morwesyrr](../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md):*
> No.

When Nacnar gives a terse no, she smiles - the first time she has done so since meeting back up with Vētrall.

Nacnar points out that Vētrall is now a mentor, so they need to learn how to fight their own battles. She goes over to the weapon stand above the fireplace, taking [Wither](../items/magic/wither.md) down from the metal hooks, before handing it over to Vētrall.

*[Nacnar Morwesyrr](../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md):*
> I'm sure you remember your training, so remember it well. This blade is extra sharp. If used correctly you can inflict a great wound with it, but disrespect it and it will humble you.

Vētrall is visibly excited, both for the rapier itself and the rare generosity from her mentor. Valan appears jealous at the special treatment, despite not knowing Nacnar. Nacnar notices, telling Vētrall that just as she trained them, maybe they can train their new student. Valan recoils slightly, expecting more suspect teaching in his future.

Nacnar wishes the pair good luck on their adventure, making a point of calling Vētrall a mentor and Valan their student. She wraps up their meeting, noting that she needs to be elsewhere and would like to lock her house up. The pair are ushered back outside. Nacnar closes the front door to arm the trapped entryway again before emerging herself.

Nacnar tells the pair that she needs to leave now, so she won't be accompanying them back to [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md). They say their goodbyes before Nacnar heads further down [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md), further down the hill that [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) is built upon.

## Recruiting Adventurers

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) head back to the top of [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md), returning to [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md). On the way Vētrall begins thinking up a speech for when they arrive, looking to drum up interest in their adventure.

There they find [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) at the front door, who greets them. When Vētrall presents 25 gp to give to the family, Hanz jokes that the pair have returned quickly, and this is probably the quickest 25 gp he's ever seen anyone make. Vētrall plays along but doesn't divulge any specifics.

Hanz announces the pair and their donation.

*[Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md):*
> Returning to us, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), who have shared 25 gold with their family!

The room, two thirds full, erupts into cheers as many Familiar Vulpes stand up and hold their ales aloft in support of the pair's endeavours. Valan sees [Eight Trees](../characters/eight-trees.md) on the other side of the table, stood with their tankard held high, smiling right at him. Valan rushes round the table to speak with his friend.

Vētrall wastes no time drumming up interest in their adventure to come. They pull out their lute and begin strumming a chord repeatedly while commanding the attention of the room. They give a speech, advertising a grand adventure that they need assistance with, one that will take them far and wide, one that involves an ancient artifact and a mystery to be uncovered.

Immediately [Turnuroth Nakris](../characters/turnuroth-nakris.md), sat near Vētrall, stands, grabbing her longsword and shield from either side of her chair. She turns to Vētrall, holds her sword aloft and lets out a roar. Vētrall recognises this as an enthusiastic expression of interest. [Eight Trees](../characters/eight-trees.md), now with Valan stood next to him, lets out a cheer while holding his tankard aloft again, mirroring Nakris' acceptance.

Vētrall is excited that anyone is interested. As everyone sits down and goes back to their business at the banquet table, Vētrall approaches Nakris, asking who they are. Nakris introduces herself by name, showing her chivalrous manner of speaking and slight flair for the dramatic. Vētrall asks her what she can do, to which Nakris raises her sword and shield, declaring that she knows well how to use both, and that she is known for having a way with words, able to mediate any situation. A proficiency for speech causes Vētrall to hesitate, not wanting to be upstaged in this regard.

At this moment Vētrall feels a tap on their side. Turning around they come face to face with [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md), a dwarf in armour, sporting a mace at his side. He enthusiastically tells Vētrall that they accept their offer. Vētrall quizzes him on his capabilities, to which Nainarv describes himself as someone who keeps others safe. He raises his mace in one hand and creates a slight radiant glow in his other empty hand. Nainarv tells Vētrall that he believes that [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) bestowed powers on him to keep other adventurers safe in combat. Vētrall is impressed by a capable [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) with healing magic.

[Eight Trees](../characters/eight-trees.md) leaves the table and heads round to Vētrall, the last of three to offer their services. Valan follows him. On arrival, Eight offers his services, stating that if Valan is coming with, he is happy to offer his assistance. Vētrall asks him what he is capable of, to which Eight raises his fists.

*[Eight Trees](../characters/eight-trees.md):*
> I know a few techniques...

Vētrall dismisses everyone while coming to a decision over who to pick. They eventually approach [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) and accept his help, a vote of confidence in his abilities that he is grateful for.

After the others are informed that they haven't been chosen, [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) goes over to [Turnuroth Nakris](../characters/turnuroth-nakris.md) and speaks to her in draconic. He assures her that she is better off for not going on this adventure, suggesting that Vētrall isn't pleasant to be around. Nakris replies in draconic, confident that Valan is wrong, shooting him down. Valan suggests that she will find plenty of other better adventures to go on. Nakris agrees that there will be other fun to be had.

## Adventure Brief

[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) asks [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) what the plan is. Vētrall tells him that they will be travelling to [Hochwald](../places/settlements/cities/hochwald.md) in search of a person called Raine. Nainarv's face lights up with excitement as he tells Vētrall that this is excellent news. When Vētrall asks why, he tells them that they'll be passing through [Dünnesland](../places/settlements/towns/dunnesland.md) where the best beers in [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) can be found. He also mentions that he is from [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md).

Vētrall warns Nainarv that they will be travelling with two others, a pair of thieves.

*[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md):*
> Common scum thieves or high value thieves?

Vētrall calls them the former. They warn Nainarv that they aren't to be trusted but to be tolerated, noting that they tried to steal from them once already. Nainarv is confused as to why [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members would be associating with thieves, but waits to form his own opinion of the pair.

Now brought up to speed, Vētrall rounds up Nainarv and Valan, telling them both that they're going to meet up with [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) at [Nomad's Stop](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/nomads-stop.md), where the pair were told to wait. With that, the three leave [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) and head across [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) for the marketplace.

## The Party Reunites

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md), [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), and [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) enter [Nomad's Stop](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/nomads-stop.md), finding [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) sat at a table towards the back of the room, drinking. Heading on over and greeting them, Marik quickly notices a third person and asks who they are.

Vētrall introduces Nainarv as another [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) member who will be accompanying them for a while. Nainarv introduces himself enthusiastically before insisting on buying beer. He heads to the bar and orders 2 ales, returning to the table with them. It becomes apparent that they're only for him. Kera grins, acknowledging his drinking prowess.

Valan buys a bottle of wine from the bar and leaves the building with it. He climbs up the side of the building which has two roofs, one half-way up. He clumsily makes his way up to the top roof, where he sits in the cold autumn air, drinking his way through the bottle. Here he prays to [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) quietly before looking up at the moon.

*[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md):*
> What am I supposed to do?

[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) does not answer, with no sign of an acknowledgement either. Valan, now tipsy, finishes the last of his bottle of wine in silence, alone on the roof.

Meanwhile Nainarv finishes his drinks and orders two rounds of ales for everyone. Marik looks intimidated by the two ales, so Kera takes one for himself from in front of her.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md), curious by the newest member of the party, asks Nainarv what he can do. Nainarv explains that he uses healing magic to keep his allies standing in battle. This impresses Kera. Nainarv asks around the table what everyone can do themselves.

Kera points to his warhammer and horns, his stature as a large muscular minotaur hinting at his combat prowess. When Nainarv asks Marik, she is evasive, not wanting to divulge details. Kera hypes her up, explaining that she can transform into animals, noting her transformations into a spider and a wolf. Nainarv recognises a druidic connection in this description. Vētrall tells Nainarv that they know how to bolster others with the sound of their voice and lute, and if need be they know how to stab with a rapier.

Kera asks Nainarv if he has any interesting stories, seeing as he is an adventurer. Nainarv states that he once saw a red dragon while on the way to Roana. Kera demands more details while Marik silently judges Nainarv, not believing the story one bit. Nainarv elaborates, telling of an adult dragon that swooped down and scooped up an adult elk like it was nothing. He was travelling with other [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members. At the sight of the dragon they all hit the deck near some bushes, lying there in extreme fear until it passed. Nainarv delivers the description of this dangerous moment with glee, enjoying the opportunity to tell his wildest story.

Eventually Valan climbs down from the roof, falling from the middle section of roof, almost hitting a patron who was on their way out of the front door. This startles the barkeep and catches the attention of the party, who see Valan stumble back inside. The group take this as a sign that they should turn in for the night, so they rent rooms out, intent on mustering out for [Hochwald](../places/settlements/cities/hochwald.md) in the morning.

Kera and Marik share a room. Valan insists on getting his own, as does Nainarv, leaving Vētrall to do the same.

*[Everyone: long rest]*

## Planning the Journey

Waking early in the morning, the party eat breakfast in [Nomad's Stop](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/nomads-stop.md). While sat down they consult their map (The [Independent States of the Nil'Savnic Alliance](../maps/independent-states-of-the-nilsavnic-alliance.md)), planning their journey to [Hochwald](../places/settlements/cities/hochwald.md).

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) would like to travel through [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) in order to buy new fine clothes from somewhere that sells them. Kera suggests that they could look for passage on a ship heading to [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md), perhaps saving them time and certainly effort traversing [Lilaweg](../places/roads/lilaweg.md). Vētrall knows from experience that while travel by ship will be less effort for them, they might not be able to get a ship to [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md) for several days, so taking the road will likely be faster.

Kera convinces the group that he will check the docks for any ships headed that way. While the rest of the party is looking into hired transport to [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md), Kera goes down to the dock, noticing two ships currently in port: a [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md) military vessel, and a trade ship with off-white sails with no discernible banner. Kera tries the military ship first, asking if he can sign up to join them. Wary of an overly enthusiastic minotaur armed with two large weapons, the [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md) rebuff him, making it plain and clear that he is to leave them alone. With the [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md) now wary of him, Kera moves to the trade ship, but they want nothing to do with him, having seen him confronting the [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md). Kera returns to the party empty handed.

At the stables the party checks their options. Vētrall originally suggests they buy horses, but the price for even draft horses is more expensive than they can reasonably afford. Instead they weigh up their options between hiring someone to drive them in an open cart or a coach. Marik would rather take a cart, but Vētrall insists that they hire a coach, pointing out that the small price increase secures them a comfortable enclosed coach with virtually no effort needed on their part. The party reluctantly agrees, especially as Vētrall offers to pay.

Within half an hour a coach is prepared and the driver meets with the party. He opens the coach's doors for them, asking them to get seated comfortably inside. Kera gets his horns stuck on the door while trying to stoop low enough to get inside, exasperating the coach driver who is worried about damage to the coach itself.

## Onwards to [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md)

As the coach gets underway, still early in the morning, the party settle in for a boring day on the road. Vētrall, Nainarv, and Valan are squeezed together on their side of the coach, but at least they are facing forward. Kera and Marik, not used to travelling in this way, struggle with the unsighted rocking and bumps from the road travel. Kera puts his arm out of the small window gap to catch some breeze as they go, while Marik suffers silently, waiting impatiently for the journey to end.

[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) produces the [Kavallos Fleet Coin](../items/kavallos-fleet-coin.md) he looted from Vorkazal the Razor. He asks Nainarv if he knows what it is, but Nainarv has never seen such a coin before. Marik asks if she can see it, so Valan passes it to her. Nainarv reaches across the table and touches Marik on the shoulder, casting Guidance on her.

*[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md):*
> Look carefully, friend.

Marik feels empowered by Nainarv's touch, a feeling that sharpens her senses. She is able to notice the fine craftsmanship of the coin and its green-ish tint, recognising it is made of cobalt. She does not recognise the symbology, but assumes it must be [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) related. She hands the coin back to Valan.

The day passes without incident, with the party keeping to themselves and their own thoughts. Eventually night begins to fall, so the driver pulls off to the side of the road. This briefly startles the party, but as the driver appears at one of the coach's swing open double doors, he tells them that it's time to sleep for the night. He will be sleeping on the roof so he can be close to the horses, but they are welcome to either sleep in the coach or camp for the night.

Everyone gets out, taking in their surroundings. Marik is thrilled to be back outside with a view of the landscape around her.

## Setting up Camp

The section of road they have stopped on is surrounded by pine trees. On the right hand side of the road is 30ft of flat grass before the land slops downwards progressively steeper, disappearing into the treeline below.

The party decides they will camp for the night. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) wastes no time taking off across the grassy area and then down the hill behind it. Where it levels out 20ft down he begins breaking small trees with his warhammer, intending to use them for firewood. [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) follows after hearing the sound of wood being bashed and split with force, finding Kera. He berates him for his crude technique and reckless damage to these young trees, but helps him carry the wood back up the steep slope.

The pair set up a campfire with the wood, Kera creating a mound of logs. Valan pulls out his tinderbox and begins trying to ignite the wood. He struggles and begins to get frustrated when Marik comes over and casts Produce Flame, putting her hands into the fire until the wood ignites, her hands unburned by the controlled burn as the fire takes hold.

Nainarv can be seen re-wrapping the leather surrounding his dwarven warhammer's grip, a fine crafted weapon that Kera admires from a distance.

## Sparring Practice

With a campfire going, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) asks the party if they'd like to spar, particularly focused on [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md). He agrees, prompting Vētrall to offer him his original rapier while he wields [Wither](../items/magic/wither.md). [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) is also interested, offering to fight without a weapon, only using his fists to go easy on the pair.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) wordlessly declines, slinking off to the campfire. She uses Wild Shape to turn into a cat and curls up by the fire.

[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) is excited by the prospect of seeing his new party in action, expressing his excitement. He goes over to Vētrall and whispers in their ear:

*[Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md):*
> Let Kera hit you. They'll struggle and it'll be funny.

Nainarv casts [Sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) on Vētrall, but fails to mention the conditions that the spell persists under. He then returns to the campfire and tries to sit next to Marik, but she moves to the other side of the campfire and curls up again.

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) immediately strikes [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) with their rapier, ending the [Sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) spell. Nainarv shouts at Vētrall that they didn't stick to the plan, before casting Shield of Faith on them instead.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) lands decisive hits on both Vētrall and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), the latter of which he knocks unconscious early in the session. Vētrall casts Healing Word before Nainarv can step in. Valan returns to his feet and continues fighting, the three happy to continue.

As the three begin to tire, Vētrall offers to float Kera and he agrees. They cast Levitate on him, causing him to rise 20ft into the air. He is astounded by the magic and floats awkwardly in the air while shouting excitedly at the sensation. Everyone else watches on with laughter or loathing.

## Suddenly Axe Beaks

The party fails to notice a pack of 6 axe beaks rushing down the road from the direction they were travelling. Hearing the noise of fighting and excited cheering they get spooked and charge into the party head-on. By the time anyone realises what is happening, the axe beaks are amongst them.

The axe beaks rush into the party, particularly [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) who are closest to their point of arrival. [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) gets up and runs into the fray, warhammer at the ready, intent on crushing axe beak skulls. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) sees an axe beak running towards her, so she climbs onto the roof of the coach, hoping it won't be able to reach her.

Two axe beaks attempt to reach [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) but he is 20ft up, so they linger there in confusion, not intelligent enough to know what to do. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) ends their concentration on Levitate, dropping Kera to the ground gently. They run into the pack of approaching axe beaks and cast Thunderwave, pushing several of them away from them, but unfortunately attracting their attention.

Kera begins hacking with his [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) greatsword while Vētrall casts Dissonant Whispers, downing the first axe beak through wracking its mind. Kera cuts one of the axe beak's head off with a clean slice straight through its neck (natural 20).

The axe beak determined to fight Marik closes in on her but struggles to hit her atop of the wagon. She casts Produce Flame at it but misses. It loses interest in her and charges towards [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), running through the campfire as it goes, destroying it and burning itself in the process. Valan begins backing up and shooting at the axe beak with his bow, risking a beak attack with each lunge away from danger.

Kera and Vētrall continue to fight the axe beaks head-on while Nainarv assists. Valan gets hit by his axe beak while backing up, prompting Vētrall to cast Healing Word to help him out. Nainarv assists by sprinting over to Valan and casting Cure Wounds on him.

Vētrall and Kera now have most of the axe beaks fighting them, which quickly takes its toll on Vētrall. As Nainarv is about to cast healing magic on Vētrall he is hit by an axe beak and knocked unconscious. Marik continues to cast Produce Flame at the axe beaks from the top of the coach but has mixed success with hitting them.

Vētrall is able to cast Healing Word on Nainarv who returns to his feet before using Channel Divinity: Preserve Life, which he shares between Vētrall and himself to spare them from the brink of death. This turns the fight around.

Vētrall kills another axe beak with Dissonant Whispers as Kera finishes hacking one in front of him using his greatsword. Valan takes down the axe beak bothering him. Marik throws her javelin at the last axe beak and hits it in the neck before Kera finishes it off.

*[Initiative order ends]*

As the fight ends, [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) cuts off the wing of one of the axe beaks, hunting for meat worth eating. He finds little but bone and feathers, so slices off part of its breast for cooking. The party rebuilds the fire and begins to cook the axe beak meat, but eventually find it to be gristly, sinewy, and gamy.
