## Searching the Crater

In the aftermath of their battle against the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) in the [Upper Tresenda](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/upper-tresenda.md) crater,
[Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) continue to survey the crater for any interesting items or revelations.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) produces a grain sack from her pack and gives it to [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) to collect [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) with. Torbra is initially hesitant at Saoirse's offer to do it herself, but Saoirse is insistent that it's no longer a problem if she goes near the dust, commenting on getting some of it up her nose. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) learns that Saoirse was once addicted to the dust, but Saoirse brushes off the fact with no further explanation.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) paces around the crater, going to places where she remembers [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) dying. She kicks at their piles of dust, treating it suspiciously as she attempts to find something within, but finding only dust.

As Saoirse surveys the crater for a pile of dust to scoop into the grain sack, she realises that the crater itself is made of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). She shovels some into the sack with her hand until it has enough weight so that dragging it along the floor slowly fills it. She ties it off and lifts it. It is as heavy as a sack of sand. She slings it over her shoulder.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) conducts her own search for items amongst the crater dust. Feeling around in places with her dagger she eventually finds something hard and curved. Torbra notices her struggling with something and comes over to assist. Thanea dislodges it somewhat with a tug but isn't able to pull it out further. Torbra steps in to finish the job, lifting the breastplate piece of [Gillian Close](../characters/gillian-close.md)'s half-plate armour. Dust cascades from it freely as it is raised from the ground.

Saoirse and [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) debate where the rest of the armour is. They postulate that someone must have died here. Saoirse thinks on whether she recognises the armour but doesn't recognise the design, realising that it's custom made. The party eventually notices four slots for leather belts to pass through, though the breastplate is devoid of belts of any kind. Thanea warns that the crater is clearly dangerous and they shouldn't stay here any longer than they need to. Resolving to investigate the piece further once back in [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md), Thanea straps it to her pack for safekeeping.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) digs near where the breastplate was unearthed but is only able to find half of a metal belt buckle. Thanea takes it.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Well... we weren't the first ones here.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Obviously not, but we're the first ones who can leave again.

Saoirse intentionally soaks in her surroundings, memorising what she sees and feels about the crater and its surrounding landscape, knowing that she will attempt to recreate details later using Minor Illusion.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) encourages the party to leave the crater. Saoirse suggests returning to [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md). The party gather their possessions and make their way back up the slopes of [Upper Tresenda](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/upper-tresenda.md), returning to the crest of the hill leading back into the north end of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). Once again they return into the expected greenery of this natural wilderness, leaving the lifeless and grey bowl-shaped valley behind.

## Returning to Scratch

The party return to the depressed forested area on the northern edge of the valley, where they departed that morning, leaving [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) in the cliffside inset with his dire wolf ([Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md)).

On arrival there is no signs of the dire wolf or any disturbance, giving the party cause for concern. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) begins searching the cliffside for signs of another opening or a disturbance. She passes in front of the known inset, finding the dire wolf squeezed into the alcove in a crescent shape, head leaning against one side of the cliff, with Scratch sat upright against its side, enveloped by both sets of paws. The wolf makes no sound or movement, simply looking [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) in the eyes. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) calls to the group that she has found them both.

Scratch begins to cough and splutter, prompting [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to shout for [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)'s help as he is awake. She drops her shield as she rushes over, stopping in the entrance to the inset.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Are you awake?

Scratch's head lifts from its backwards position, rolling about his neck until it is cocked to its side. Clearly he is unable to lift it. He musters his first feeble words.

*[Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md):*
> And who are you?

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) explains that they are [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) from the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md). [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) informs him that they are the ones that took care of him earlier. Not acknowledging their replies, Scratch asks what happened. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks him to be more specific, as they originally found him in this current state. Scratch begins coughing violently as his whole body leans to the side. The dire wolf's head comes round to support his body before it comes to rest on his legs.

Allisa places a hand on the cliffside and leans in further. She stretches her palm out in a stopping motion before reassuring Scratch.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Save your strength. It's going to be okay.

Allisa exits the recess, her metal facemask aimed at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) as she passes by to retrieve her shield. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) asks if they should move him from the cliffside, but Allisa plainly states that "this one is yours", not wishing to interfere further with a member of the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md).

The party discusses their next move, immediately discussing a rest after their battle. As they do, [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) heads over to Scratch, entering the recess. She places a hand on his chest and uses Healing Hands, producing a brief glow of radiant energy.

This burst of healing magic gives Scratch a brief windfall of energy. He is able to slowly raise his head, locking his remaining eye with Thanea. She watches it drift down her person and back up as he notices her [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) military badge.

*[Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md):*
> You're one of us!

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Yeah, we're from [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), and we found you here.

*[Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md):*
> Starfall... which Major?

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> We work with Elysia. What about you?

Scratch's chest begins undulating as he attempts to stifle another coughing fit. He leans back in pain until the moment passes before regaining his composure and lifting his head to meet Thanea's gaze again.

*[Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md):*
> Kin Squad. Phenomena.

A worried expression comes across Scratch's face as he gets flashes of his squad's battle in [Upper Tresenda](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/upper-tresenda.md).

*[Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md):*
> Where are the others?

Saoirse states her shared curiosity on the matter, implying to Scratch that they don't know. Thanea explains that they only found him and his companion, gesturing to the dire wolf he leans against.

*[Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md):*
> Where's Cherish?

Scratch wonders where [Cherish Loweswater](../characters/cherish-loweswater.md) is, realising that [Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md) needs his wife's comfort. As he vocalises her name he bursts into a coughing fit, his head jerking backwards as his back arches in pain. Allisa rushes over at the sound of this, pushing past the party. She gets an arm behind him and pulls him upright, patting his back to help with his breathing. The party watches as his coughing soon subsides while a mix of saliva and blood runs out of the corner of his mouth into his chin fur.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) declares that Scratch is done talking for now. Torbra agrees, suggesting they rest too. Allisa cleans up Scratch's mouth before emerging from the recess, lingering for a second to make sure he is alright. She goes back to checking the perimeter, her head hanging lower in sombre contemplation. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) orders Scratch to rest and not to talk and that the party will try to get him to safety soon. He doesn't respond.

## Catching their Breath

*[Everyone: short rest]*

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) finds a fallen log to sit on while the party rests. It is clear to everyone that her head is down. [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) quickly heads over to join her, also taking a seat. It takes Allisa a moment to even realise Saoirse is there.

Allisa apologises for being absent minded, Saoirse immediately apologising for interrupting her rest. Allisa reveals that she was actually praying. Saoirse explains that she has no experience with prayer. Allisa tells her that she is searching for guidance. Saoirse asks from whom.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Well, not [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md)... But yeah, long story; I worship [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md).

Allisa points at the [Citrine Eye Necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md) around Saoirse's neck, stating that it is her power within. Allisa then clasps the gemstone between her hands and pushes more radiant magic into it, causing it to glow dimly against her leather gloves, which Saoirse sees clearly. It continues to do so for a while after Allisa lets it fall back around her neck.

*[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> I've never been very religious, but this is pretty cool. Actual proof that they do actually care and do something.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Well they're very real. Care is a strong word, though.

*[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> She did help us today.

Allisa praises Saoirse's use of the [Sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) spell within the necklace, telling her that she put it to good use in the crater. Saoirse reckons it will definitely come in handy, thanking Allisa for loaning it to her.

## The Remains of [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md)

Allisa stands, declaring that the party needs to decide what to do with "their squad lead".
Torbra overhears and suggests trying to get the dire wolf to carry [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) on its back.

Saoirse tries using Minor Illusion to create an image of that this might look like. She creates it easily, even animating what it would look like running. The wolf approaches her, flicks its tongue across her hand, then licks around its teeth casually before staring at her blankly. When Saoirse gestures to Scratch the wolf glances over briefly, but stares idly at Saoirse afterwards. She remarks that she thought these creatures were smarter. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is dismissive of her assertion.

Torbra suggests getting the wolf to lie down so they can load Scratch onto it. Her and [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) consider how they could get the wolf to leave the cliffside inset, settling on moving Scratch first, assuming the wolf will follow. Torbra goes into the inset and begins gently raising Scratch to his feet by pulling his arms. Saoirse comes to assist. They get Scratch to his feet, who makes a few weak and tentative steps, clearly unable to walk on his own. After a few steps the dire wolf begins to growl, standing up, staring at Torbra.

Saoirse sternly instructs the wolf to come with them, but its eyes remain locked on Torbra. It moves to her side and clamps its teeth around [Verlust](../items/magic/verlust.md) at Torbra's side, tugging at it gently while growling. Torbra puts Scratch down gently so she can remove it from her belt, allowing the wolf to take the longsword. It stops growling immediately, tilting its head under the weight of the blade and lowering its head. It paces for a moment before returning to Scratch, laying the sword on his chest and letting it go from its mouth.

Torbra wonders if the breastplate will evoke a reaction, asking Thanea to retrieve it. Saoirse wonders if [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) fought [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md). Torbra suggests that they might have fought in the crater themselves.

Thanea approaches the dire wolf with [Gillian Close](../characters/gillian-close.md)'s breastplate, catching it off guard. It leans in to sniff the shield as its mouth quivers in confusion. Suddenly its ears droops and it pulls its head back with a whimper before slowly collapsing to the floor, clearly forlorn.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) wonders if they should take the wolf back to [Upper Tresenda](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/upper-tresenda.md) to dig around in the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater - perhaps it will find something they missed. Thanea suggests that the wolf won't leave Scratch alone, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) retorting that they could take him with them too. Torbra interrupts to urge everyone to try mounting Scratch while the wolf is lying down.

Saoirse worries that returning to the crater may be a waste of their time, considering Scratch's condition and the ever present threat of getting snowed into [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) when the first seasonal snow arrives. Thanea urges the party to hurry back to [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md) as saving Scratch's life will mean an eyewitness to what happened here. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is resistant to leave in such a hurry.

Torbra notices that Scratch's hand is now grasping the grip of [Verlust](../items/magic/verlust.md). Saoirse implores the party to ask his name next time they get a chance. Thanea returns the breastplate to her pack.

## Saddling a Dire Wolf

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) once again urges everyone to help get [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) onto the dire wolf. [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) pulls her rope out from her pack, passing one end to [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md). Meanwhile Torbra and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) begin to lift Scratch from the ground.

The pair are able to get Scratch lifted and onto the dire wolf's back. As soon as his weight is felt by the wolf it begins to stand and turn, unsure what is going on. Saoirse and [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) quickly throw the ends of the rope between each other, both under and over, wrapping it around Scratch's waist and legs as best as they can. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) ties off her end quickly while Saoirse finds herself without enough rope to tie a knot, making do by wrapping what is left around Scratch's leg.

As the dire wolf finishes standing up, Scratch slumps forward awkwardly but remains affixed to the wolf's back. He can be seen grasping [Verlust](../items/magic/verlust.md) to his right side, the blade pointed downwards due to its unmanageable weight. The wolf turns around twice in its confusion, seeing the party but unsure of where Scratch has gone or what is happening. Saoirse once against uses Minor Illusion in an attempt to comfort the wolf but gets accidentally swatted in the face by its turning tail, breaking her concentration.

After a few turns Scratch slides over to the side, stopped by the ropes. The wolf sees Scratch over its shoulder while turning, stopping in its tracks once it realises where its friend is. It relaxes, accepting the situation.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) wonders how they're going to get the dire wolf to follow them. Saoirse retrieves a ration from her pack and offers it. It nibbles a corner sheepishly but gets more interested as she begins walking away from it, following instinctively. She tries heading back down the valley but ends up walking east. Thanea pulls out her map ([Astorrel Map of Southeastern Kardan](../maps/astorrel-map-of-southeastern-kardan.md)) and swiftly corrects Saoirse into a southerly bearing. Saoirse bemoans her bad sense of direction.

## Allisa Says Goodbye

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) keeps watch, following [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s directions west back to the trail, around the entrance to the northern pass to the [Albulain Valley](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/albulain-valley.md). She consults the party for which direction they are headed.

Thanea feels strongly that the party should proceed south to avoid the snow. The conversation then turns to whether to return to [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md) or bypass the town and go direct to [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) advocates for [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md), suggesting that the smaller town would be more tolerant of a dire wolf in its centre, and the party knows that there is at least one [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) there that can help them. Either town would afford them ways of getting a message back to [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md). Thanea and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) are won over by the argument.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)'s hope of staying with [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) for longer dies as they agree to head south. Her arms carrying her staff and shield go limp.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), to Saoirse:*
> Well, I guess this is goodbye then.

[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) implores her to tag along a bit longer, but Allisa makes it clear that she can't, pointing to the ridge to the west, cryptically stating that she needs to go that way. Before she can finish, Saoirse rushes over and embraces her in a firm hug. Allisa drops her equipment, hesitates for a moment, but ultimately returns a firm and sincere hug. After a moment Allisa pulls back and places a hand on Saoirse's shoulder.

*[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Thank you for your help. It's meant a lot.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> You too. It's been lovely meeting you. All of you.  
> I know this won't be the last time we meet, but... it's hard to say goodbye, you know?

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> I know but you always have a way to contact us, right?

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Yeah. I'll check in from time to time.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> I'm sure we'll meet again.

Allisa lets go of Saoirse's shoulder, straightens up formally, then bows from her back in respect.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> May the wings of [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) guide you.

Both Saoirse and Thanea thank her for everything she has done for them.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Thank you, safe travels, and take care of yourself.
> Don't get... don't get caught. I'm sorry, I'm not good at this... I'm not good at goodbyes.

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), emotion in her voice:*
> It's okay! But this isn't goodbye, it's until next time.

*[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> If you come across any [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md), be sure to kick their asses though - they deserve it!

Allisa laughs while rubbishing the notion, clearly unable to do so due to her ties to the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). She gathers her staff and shield, attaching the latter to her back. She points her staff at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and then Torbra:

*[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md):*
> Remember what we discussed.
> Well, until next time...

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) turns around and places her hand on an invisible door, casting Dimension Door. The seams of a door appear as a hanging, unmoving strip of white light before it pushes open, hinged on the fourth invisible side of the door frame. Blue sky can be seen beyond as she steps through. The door snaps shut as soon as she crosses the threshold, the seam of light dissipating almost immediately. Where she once stood, there is now only grass and the view of the valley beyond.

*[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Well... I really hope I don't fuck up now.

After a brief moment [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) continues their journey south, intent on getting [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) some much needed medical aid.

## Backtracking Through the Valley

Over the next three days [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) follows the trail south through the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) without incident.

*[Everyone: long rest x3]*

Each night they remove [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) from the dire wolf, then by morning they cajole the wolf into letting them rope him to its back. By their third time doing this the wolf has learned to anticipate it, turning the task from a manic struggle into a routine affair. The party feeds the wolf rations each day, taking turns to chip in.

Each morning [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) uses Healing Hands on Scratch. This perks him up briefly, making it easier for them to lift him onto the dire wolf and position him appropriately. On the first morning Scratch moves [Verlust](../items/magic/verlust.md) into the right side of his belt, keeping it in place away from his wounded left side.

With healing magic in effect each morning, the party also has a brief window in which Scratch is lucid enough to talk, though it pains him to speak, so their conversations are brief.

### First Morning

Saoirse apologises for any discomfort Scratch is in during their journey, before asking Scratch for his name. He simply replies "Scratch", pulling a toothy grin before coughing profusely, immediately undoing his attempt at charm. Saoirse says it is nice to meet him before stating that they'll take good care of him.

### Second Morning

*[Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md):*
> Where's Cherish?

*[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> You've mentioned them before. We've only been able to find you... and your wolf.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) asks what they look like, Scratch responding with few words, stating she is a young tiefling woman. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) explains that they've not found anyone matching his description.

Torbra gets [Gillian Close](../characters/gillian-close.md)'s breastplate from [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s back and holds it above Scratch's head so he can view it comfortably. The tension he is holding just to remain comfortable leaves him as he realises what he is looking at.

*[Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md):*
> Ahh fuck...

Immediately following this Scratch passes back out.

### Third Morning

Saoirse asks Scratch what the wolf's name is. When Scratch states "Elrick", Saoirse calls it a very fancy name for a wolf. Fighting to speak through his pain, Scratch barely manages to clarify.

*[Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md):*
> He's... Cherish's... husband.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) immediately questions if Cherish was into bestiality. Torbra gets Scratch to confirm what he said. He gives an approving nod before spluttering again. Once finished he turns his head over towards Torbra, reaches out a hand, and struggles through one more sentence before passing out:

*[Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md):*
> He... can't hear you.

Torbra posits that [Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md) is a druid trapped in his wild shape, Saoirse agreeing and noting that she already suggested this theory. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) goes another way, suggesting that Cherish might be the druid - she could have used her wild shape to become a dire wolf herself and form a relationship with Elrick. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is convinced that Elrick is merely a dire wolf.

Saoirse argues that [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s theory seems weird due to Elrick's name alone which sounds too much like a person's. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) rubbishes this idea by mentioning that most don't get to pick their own name.

Saoirse tests the dire wolf's reaction to its name throughout their travel, but as [Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md) is deaf, even in wild shape, he does not respond.

## A Dire Wolf Strolls Into [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md)

By the end of the third day of travel, [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) reaches the junction that signposts both [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md) and [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md). They continue south, camping for the night nearby, knowing that tomorrow they will arrive in [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md).

*[Everyone: long rest]*

By late afternoon the party glimpses the rooftops of [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md) and the tower of the [Blittergate Astornox Stronghold](../places/settlements/strongholds/blittergate-astornox-stronghold.md), with [Blittergate Lake](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/blittergate-lake.md) behind it. [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) suggests they go to [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md).

Walking down the road into the town centre, the party passes next to the stronghold tower. An [Astornox guard](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) on watch above raises the alarm, shouting about the sight of a dire wolf. As the party pass the front of the building, the main door swings open and two guards emerge, both with longswords and shields equipped, expecting combat.

When they shout for the party to stand back so that they can slay the beast, [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) shouts back that it's friendly. Saoirse produces [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md)'s [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) badge and thrusts it towards the guards, adding legitimacy to their claims. The guards are stunned, scarcely believing what they're seeing, never mind hearing. The dire wolf turns its head towards them and gives a throaty growl. One the guard backs up into the wall of the building, startled in the moment.

One guard asks what is up with Scratch who is tied to the top of the dire wolf. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) gives a brief explanation about him being from [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md), the only survivor they could find. She mentions that they're looking for somewhere his wounds can be treated, prompting Saoirse to state more urgently that he needs urgent medical assistance. The guard turns and shouts back into the stronghold, demanding someone fetch "Fresk". The guard offers to let the party into the stronghold, or they can wait at [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) for assistance to arrive. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) opts for the latter.

Saoirse asks about getting a letter to [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) to inform her of what's happened. The guard explains that they can send a carrier pigeon to [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md) if they'd like. When Saoirse gets into the details, the guard stops her, suggesting they discuss this after the tabaxi is taken care of. The party continues down the street towards [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) and the dire wolf follows. Both guards stand frozen, dumbfounded by the absurdity of what they are witnessing.

## Entering [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md)

Reaching the front door at the corner of [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md), the party begin enacting a hasty plan to get [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) inside. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) volunteers to go inside to seek help while [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) volunteers to keep tabs on the dire wolf. [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is worried that moving Scratch inside will cause the wolf to follow. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) begins removing the ropes from Scratch, Saoirse helping. The pair are careful to ensure that Scratch doesn't suddenly fall from the wolf's back.

[Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) enters the building, finding the tavern area empty except for [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md). She was stood by one of the front windows to the right, but recoils as [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) enters, caught watching events transpiring in the street. She quickly recognises [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), noting her surprise that it is [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) here again. She asks what is going on, nervous and inquisitive. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) concisely explains that they found another [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) who is in desperate need of medical attention.

Shocked and flustered, Reed darts for the door to head outside and offer her assistance. As soon as she glances outside she sees the dire wolf before her. She screams instinctively, backing up into the building in a panic. Her foot gets caught on a chair leg and she falls backwards. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) tries to stop her but only manages to get a hand to her shoulder. Reed lands on her back with a thud, yelping at the pain.

Now terrified and in pain, Reed demands to know what is going on. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) characterises the dire wolf as "their new friend" and not to be worried about. She gets up and immediately gets to work pulling chairs into a corner of the room. She glares at [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), shouting at her to help. The pair begin clearing chairs and then tables to the left and right most edges of the room, either side of the bar.

Meanwhile outside a crowd of townsfolk is beginning to form. Initially motivated to investigate due to the scream, they soon find the dire wolf and commotion, hanging back at a generous distance that still affords them a view. An increasing number of people are heading towards [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) from the marketplace down the east street. Two different [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) arrive from the stronghold, march over to the crowd and begin turning them away, loudly claiming that there isn't anything to see here.

## The Medic's First Look

As the crowd is dispersed, [Marlene Fresk](../characters/marlene-fresk.md) approaches the party from the direction of the stronghold. She is wearing [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) uniform rather than guard armour. Her judgmental gaze passes across the party still outside before she speaks, demanding to know what is going on here. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) states that they're getting someone medical help.

Marlene turns her attention to [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md), who [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) have just helped down from the back of the dire wolf.

*[Marlene Fresk](../characters/marlene-fresk.md):*
> Oh my gosh, they're still alive?

*[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md):*
> Not for much longer unless they get medical attention.

Marlene swears under her breath. Flustered, she vocalises her assumption that they're to head into the building. She takes Scratch from Thanea and Saoirse and grabs him under his remaining arm, carefully walking him to the door. She shouts into the room requesting a couple of tables to work with.

[Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md) immediately moves to one of the large tables still set up on the right side of the room. She begins pulling chairs out from under it while [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) arrives to help. The pair heave the large square wooden table across the room with much effort, stopping once it is in the middle of the room near the door.

Without pleasantries Marlene orders Torbra to put Scratch on the table while she retrieves some things. She points at Thanea and demands she follow her immediately. Both comply readily, happy to be bossed around in exchange for medical assistance.

## Retrieving Medical Supplies

[Marlene Fresk](../characters/marlene-fresk.md) looks over her shoulder to check [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) is following her. When she sees her behind, she breaks into a jog as soon as she exits the building, turning left. Four buildings down the street on the right she arrives at [Fresk House](../places/buildings/houses/fresk-house.md). She produces a key and unlocks the door. Standing in the doorway she waves to beckon Thanea inside before entering herself.

By the time Thanea enters, Marlene is on the far side of the room, hurriedly combing through her bookcase (mostly full of vials and jars) for books, supplies, and linen she can use. When she finds things she needs, she throws it onto the table behind her. Continuing her search she points Thanea to a pair of chairs on the left side of the room, telling her of a wicker basket that she should begin putting the items in. Thanea finds and retrieves it, places it on the table, and begins placing whatever Marlene puts down into it.

Marlene opens the door into her living area, disappearing out of sight. She can be heard manipulating a metal chain before returning holding a censer - a small ball bottomed metal bowl suspended from three metal chains with a hook at their end. She places it on the table more gently, but its rounded bottom still allows some of the ash within to spill. Thanea loads it up all the same.

Marlene returns to the other room. She rifles through drawers until she accidentally pulls one too hard, causing it to come out entirely and slam to the floor from the second-bottom slot. She utters a second breathy swear but keeps going in haste. She emerges from the room clutching a leather roll (medic's tools), closing the door behind her.

Seeing that Thanea has packed everything, Marlene stands stunned for a moment before shouting for Thanea to get moving. She ushers her out of her house before locking up. Thanea waits for her to lock the door, causing Marlene to glare at her. As soon as the door is locked, Marlene jogs back down the street, clutching her leather roll. Thanea gives chase.

## Destroying an Inn

While [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) lays [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) down on the large table, [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md) is frantically pacing, not sure what to do. She mutters incoherently about getting the party food and drinks, going through the motions of her hosting duties to help ground her.

Working through her many questions, she asks what is happening about the dire wolf. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is aloof, suggesting it can enter and lay its head on the table, not seeing any danger in the large creature.

The dire wolf pokes its large head through the open door, curious to see what is happening with Scratch. Torbra tries to calm it, noticing it is breathing heavily. For a moment it looks to calm, but begins lowering itself and crawling forwards so it can get through the double wide door. Once in it heads to the back left corner of the room and curls up much like it did in the cliffside indent. Too large for its own good, it puts its body weight on the haphazard pile of chairs, the sound of wood splintering signalling the destruction of several of them as it settles.

Reed, having headed into the back room behind the counter, emerges with a jug of water. She begins to grab a wooden mug from behind the bar when she catches the wolf in the right side of her peripheral vision. She mutters "one problem at a time" to herself rapidly to suppress her panic before she returns to providing token refreshments.

## This May Hurt

[Marlene Fresk](../characters/marlene-fresk.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) return to [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) with medical supplies. Marlene hurries over to the table that [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) is now lying on, placing the leather roll of medic's tools next to him. As she unrolls it the party sees what initially looks like thieves' tools, they quickly notice knives and other unknown instruments. Marlene plucks out a small magnifying glass and begins examining Scratch's eye socket.

As Marlene begins her clinical assessment of Scratch, her nerves give way to professional calm. She politely asks Thanea to bring the basket to her. Thanea is quick acting and obedient, wishing only to help. She describes the jar of Keoghtom's Ointment which Thanea passes to her. Marlene uncorks it, dips a finger slightly, then tastes & smells it before frowning in thought and corking it again.

Marlene instructs Thanea to fetch a different jar full of Relaxing Bark. When Thanea retrieves it she recognises what it contains, a recipe her mentor used to throw into a campfire to promote good rest after a tiring hunt. A wave of memories cause Thanea to recognise that most of the ingredients Marlene fetched are traditional healing remedies, many of which are familiar to her. Marlene explains how Thanea should use the Relaxing Bark: crush some of the bark, place it in the censer, hang it from the ceiling and burn it.

Thanea follows the instructions well, using a chair to reach the ceiling beams so she can hook the censer to it. Thanea begins casting a weak Fire Bolt, stopping the spell just after it begins conjuring fire from her fingertip - enough fire to light the bark. Marlene continues her examination without looking at what Thanea is doing, but still catches her magic.

*[Marlene Fresk](../characters/marlene-fresk.md):*
> Nice trick. I assume this is also magic that's closed these wounds?

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Yeah. Although we're not healers we tried out best to keep Scratch alive.

*[Marlene Fresk](../characters/marlene-fresk.md):*
> Well this is some pretty potent stuff. Honestly I'm impressed.  
> You're sure you're not some sort of healer?

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Most of my magic is rather destructive, but I am an alchemist and a herbalist.

Marlene holds up the jar of Keoghtom's Ointment and asks Thanea what it is, testing her knowledge. Thanea hasn't seen it before and answers truthfully. Marlene states its name and explains that it is made from aloe and helps dull the pain. She starts a sentence about how it hurts but instead turns to [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and makes an understated request:

*[Marlene Fresk](../characters/marlene-fresk.md):*
> Would you do me a favour please and... hold him down.

Torbra agrees, positioning herself over Scratch's intact arm. Marlene uses her thumb to collect an amount of the jelly-like ointment before carefully swiping it down Scratch's raw and scarred left cheek.

Scratch begins to scream, attempting to stand up to escape the pain. Torbra fails to keep him in place against the table, allowing him to sit up, flicking the ointment from Marlene's thumb onto the floor. Marlene takes her other hand and pushes down on his left shoulder, applying firm pressure to his raw flesh above his severed arm. As she does so she turns to Torbra and sternly shouts:

*[Marlene Fresk](../characters/marlene-fresk.md):*
> I said hold him down!
