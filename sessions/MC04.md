## Investigating the Dock

Following their meeting with [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md), the party leave the [Tour de la Côte](../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md). On their way out they discuss their next course of action, deciding to make their way to the [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) docks to search for any signs of [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) spies on [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md). Night is present by the time they exit the tower.

Making their way through the streets, the party emerges to find the three pier dock, the middle of which is occupied by [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md). There are several visible pairs of [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards patrolling, some of which are posted on the dock closest to the ship.

As the party is evaluating the situation, two guards approach the party. They inform them that the area is under quarantine and so they're not allowed to be here. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) steps up, asking on whose orders. When the guard replies that his orders come from the arch-mage, Vētrall explains that the party have just came from the arch-mage who has asked for their help. They explain to the guards that there is a [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) plot to invade the city, and that there is no disease onboard [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) - a part of their misdirection.

The guards are adamant that their orders still stand, but the party seem convincing enough and are free to look around the docks, but expressly forbidden to enter or tamper with the ship. Vētrall thanks him for his time.

Looking around, the party notice that the deck of [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) appears to be quiet, with no signs of the crew. There is also no plank for boarding the ship. Only three ropes connect the ship to the dock. There are also two large wooden crates that two guards are standing next to, which briefly attracts [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md)'s attention.

As the party is looking around and then chatting amongst themselves to formulate a plan, one of the guards casts Dancing Lights, creating three floating orbs of light above them, illuminating them for all the guards to see. The party feels the eyes of every guard on the dock upon them. After a short moment, [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) notices the Dancing Lights at the dock from the [Tour de la Côte](../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md) and casts Daylight above them, illuminating the entire dock with a large orb of bright light.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) decides to make his way towards the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md) to the south, wary that a lack of activity at the docks could mean trouble there instead.

## Sneaking Onto the Dock

The rest of the party decide to use Vētrall's [Dust of Disappearance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/dust-of-disappearance) to make them all invisible, allowing them an attempt at sneaking onto the ship unseen. They cross the street that passes in front of the dock and dive into a darkened alley where they use the dust, turning [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md), [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) invisible for 7 minutes.

The three carefully make their way back to the dock, taking care not to make any noise as they go, but going as fast as they can, knowing that the dust's effect only lasts so long.

They pass the first pair of [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) without any incident - the pair are none the wiser that they have just been passed by invisible people.

Approaching the second and only other pair of guards on the pier, Valan's feet cause one of the beams of wood the pier is constructed of to flex with a creaking sound. One of the guards is spooked, declaring there is someone there. The second guard reacts by checking for movement under the pier, thinking that someone may be trying to traverse the supports underneath.

Understanding that the guards have detected their presence, [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) reacts quickly, casting Druidcraft to make the sound of a cat behind the guards, hoping to attract their attention and explain the creaking pier. Instead the three (Marik in particular) are utterly shocked when casting the spell causes Marik to become visible instantly. Marik stands petrified for a moment, the guards doing the same, before they shout loudly that there are intruders on the dock.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) wastes no time in running towards [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md). Valan casts Fog Cloud, enveloping the pier and area surrounding the ship in a thick blanket of fog that clings to its spot in the air. Valan tries to grab Marik and run towards the ship, but Marik has already taken off running in that direction. Panicked, all three try to get onto the ship individually.

## Searching the Ship

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) attempts to ascend the rope onto [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md), doing so with speed and grace. They search the deck, finding nobody in sight, but signs of supplies and recent life. Noticing a door to the captain's quarters at the aft of the ship and a staircase leading below deck near the bow, Vētrall opts to try downstairs first.

Struggling to see through the fog and panicked by the situation, Vētrall finds a single door around a corner that is locked, and is unable to hear anything from within. Discouraged, they then try the captain's quarters door which is also locked.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) starts shuffling up one of the ropes but falls off half way up, splashing down into the darkened waters below. [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) scrambles up a rope quickly, arriving on the deck as Vētrall is trying the captain's quarter's door.

Vētrall points out that the doors are locked, prompting Valan to make his way across the deck to try the door below deck himself.

## Kera at the Artillery

By this time [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) has made his way 500ft south of the dock, arriving at the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md). He checks around the base of the structure, looking for signs of a boat, but sees none. This includes checking out to sea.

He makes his way up one of the pairs of steps to the elevated portion of the structure, coming across a patrol of two [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md). He also notices four stone mounds, each with a large cannon facing out to sea, each with a [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) cannoneer stationed at it.

Kera makes his way over to the guards, who are dismissive of his presence, telling him that this is a controlled area and he must leave at once. Kera is persistent, informing the guards of a plot to take the city by the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md), and that the quarantine placed on [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) was fabricated to sneak spies into the town.

## [The Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) Explodes

As [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) points at [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) while explaining to the guards its role in the plot, a large cache of gunpowder in the bow of the ship explodes. Unbeknownst to the party, [Captain Gill](../characters/clef-gill.md) and the original crew of [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) who were tied up below deck are all killed instantly in the blast.

The entire bow of the ship explodes, shattering its construction completely, sending planks and shrapnel flying up to 60ft into the sky. A giant fireball races out from its bowels, enveloping half of the ship in fire. The forward mast of the ship is sent 30ft into the air before it crashes down to the dock, piercing the pier with a tremendous force, shattering the pier nearest the ship completely.

Flaming debris rains over the dock, setting fire to the pier and splashing into the water like bullets. The ship immediately lurches forward as its structure is compromised, the stern of the ship lifting into the air as the bow begins to sink. Fire rages where the bow of the ship once was, only quenched when the parts that remain sink under the water's surface.

From a distance a large fireball can be observed as well as a brief condensation cloud that circles above it, illuminated against the night sky by the fireball. This indicates the strength of the explosion. Moments later the shockwave hits [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md), rattling buildings and blowing out windows on the other side of the street from the docks.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) watches as [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) disappears into the flames in front of them, losing track of him before getting hit by the shockwave and some minor debris. In that moment, Vētrall believes Valan to be dead. Valan is sent flying into the air, losing consciousness from the blast.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) dives into the water at the first sign of danger, avoiding the fireball. As she resurfaces she watches as debris rains down around her, the mast crashes into the pier, and several [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) who are on fire run along the pier before jumping into the sea, desperately trying to save their lives.

Valan crashes down into the water not too far from Marik. Recognising the drow, Marik pulls him to the surface, finding him unconscious. She begins to drag him to the shore nearest the dock.

Vētrall screams Valan's name in terror as the ship begins to lurch forward. Briefly looking for signs of life, Vētrall is then startled into a scream as a torso devoid of limbs slams onto the deck near to them. The remains are sporting leathers that do not match either Valan's attire or the [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md)'s uniform. As the ship begins to tip forward, Vētrall runs over to the edge of the deck and swan dives into the water, breaching the surface with grace. While swimming back to the surface, Vētrall observes debris raining down into the water, much of it on fire.

They surface and spot Marik with Valan's unconscious body. They swim over in a panic, happy to see Valan, but then immediately dismayed that he is unconscious at best, and dead at worst. Vētrall casts Healing Word, but Valan's lungs are full of water and he is drowning. Vētrall accompanies Marik as she drags Valan back to shore while Valan fights for his life.

[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md), seeing the fireball from the [Tour de la Côte](../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md), casts Daylight over the top of the ship, the large glowing orb causing light to streak through the flames and smoke, illuminating the surface of the water and the deck, but causing visibility issues for those in the immediate vicinity.

## Reaction at the Artillery

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) is horrified at what he sees, fearing for his friends' lives. He examines his finger in awe, genuinely believing that he caused the ship to explode by pointing at it. The pair of [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) and the cannoneers are stunned for a moment as they watch the explosion unfold before the shockwave arrives.

The guards take off running from the structure, descending the stairs and running along the street in the direction of the dock. The cannoneers hold their positions, obeying their orders to stand vigilant against any threat from the sea.

Kera holds his position, watching the [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) abandon the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md). He realises that the explosion may well be a distraction...

## Sabotaging the Cannons

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) keeps an eye on the area surrounding the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md). It isn't long before he spots three [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers running towards the structure from an alley across the street, emerging from the darkness to attack. Kera shouts to the cannoneers, alerting them to the danger.

*[Initiative order begins]*

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) steps up to the edge of the structure to get a better view, seeing three hobgoblin [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers approaching, armed with longswords and tower shields. The cannoneers follow his lead, stepping to the edge of the structure. Three of them see the soldiers approaching and prepare for battle. The fourth follows suit as the soldiers begin ascending the stairs.

On the north side of the structure Kera, the cannoneers, and the soldiers clash. Quickly two of the cannoneers are dispatched, it becoming clear to Kera that these are well trained and dangerous people. The cannoneers and Kera have little luck penetrating their defences, the tower shields blocking most incoming blows. As the soldiers group up to attack, they play off of each other, striking with deadly blows through openings created by the other's movements.

As the first two cannoneers fall, Kera runs to the third cannon (south to north), pulls out his tinderbox and flint, and attempts to set the cannon off, hoping it is already loaded. The cannon's already loaded gunpowder explodes loudly, sending a cannonball hurtling into the sea aimlessly, disappearing into the darkness. Kera is confident the noise will have been heard.

Before long a pair of [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards runs down the street to the coastal artillery from the direction of the dock, sprinting up the stairs at the sight and sounds of sword fighting above them. As Kera keeps his distance, the two guards clash with the soldiers, fruitlessly exchanging blows due to the [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) being heavily armoured. Regardless, they struggle to find purchase with their glaives.

To the south a cannoneer begins loading the first (southern most) cannon, a painstakingly slow process that sees him load a cannonball and turn the cannon towards the group of guards and soldiers. He picks his angle, hoping to only hit the soldiers in the process.

One of the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers breaks rank and runs up the steps to the third cannon, throwing a bomb at the powder keg near to it. The bomb ignites the keg, causing an explosion that deals heavy damage to the cannon. As he looks to throw another bomb, the [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards move in and finish him off.

As this is happening, the cannoneer fires the first cannon. A cannonball hurtles across the structure, striking the ground and bouncing upwards into the chest of one of the remaining [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers. It punctures his torso, sending pieces of him scattering across the stonework. The cannonball narrowly avoids the [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards.

By this point only the cannoneer who just fired is left standing. The two [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards remain, but the devastating attacks from the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers are taking their toll. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) considers running, unable to take many more hits.

## Joining the Fight

Meanwhile [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) pulls [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md)'s body out from the water. She casts Healing Word, bringing him back to consciousness now that his lungs are cleared. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) is ecstatic to see him alive.

The group decide on their next course of action. Seeing [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) and some [Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) running through the nearby street towards the dock but seemingly unaware of uninterested in them, they don't feel in any immediate danger. It dawns on them that [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) went to the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md), so they take off running in that direction.

It takes them a while to arrive, by which point all of the above fighting has transpired.

## Backup Arrives

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) arrive at the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md), out of breath but ready to fight. As they arrive they watch two more [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers emerge from another alley, intent on storming the structure.

Valan wastes no time loosing arrows into the closest soldier, downing him before he can even reach the stairs. The second continues to the southern stairs and begins to ascend them, met by a wall of two [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards at the top. The three exchange blows for multiple turns but neither side is able to land a hit, each side too highly armoured and skilled in defence. Eventually the soldier strikes a killing blow on one of the guards, who collapses down the stairs, pushing the soldier to the bottom with him.

Kera continues to scuffle with the soldier left on the structure. He is able to prevent him from ascending the stairs to the second cannon, pushing him off the stairs with his minotaur horns. After some jostling he is able to get up the stairs and bombs the second cannon, once again igniting the powder keg and dealing the cannon a serious blow.

[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md), now aware of trouble at the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md) due to the explosions, casts Daylight above the middle of the structure, illuminating the area for all to see.

The cannoneer starts re-arming the cannon, this time with sights on the soldier trying to ascend the stairs. Kera and the remaining guard flank the soldier, trying their hardest to dispatch him quickly.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) catches up with Marik and Valan, reaching the structure. As they do, a [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) infiltrator runs out from a third alley, magically disguised as a high elf in adventuring gear. He shouts to those nearby, declaring that he's here to help, before making his way up the northern staircase. Vētrall follows. As they both reach the top of the staircase, the infiltrator drops his disguise, revealing himself to be a [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) spy, a more demonic looking hobgoblin dressed in black with octopus-like tendrils. He immediately lays into Vētrall, punching four times, three of which connect. Vētrall is shaken by the sudden attack and scrambles for safety.

## Destroying the Catapult

Marik and Valan notice a catapult in one of [the alleys](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md), wound up and ready to fire, though with nobody operating it. They make their way over along with one of the two newly arrived [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards to see if they can disable the siege weapon.

Valan tries to hit it with an arrow but misses, the arrow sailing clean over it. As Marik approaches, one of the guards thrusts his glaive through it, not connecting with anything solid. It becomes apparent that the catapult is an illusion, which successfully drew attention away from the coastal artillery.

The infiltrator uses the opportunity to throw bombs at the fourth (northern most) cannon, finishing the job started by the soldiers. The cannon lays destroyed. The last remaining soldier on the wall does the same with the third cannon.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) uses Wild Shape to turn into a wolf. She begins to charge up the southern stairs to help with the soldier at its top.

The cannoneer fires the first (southern most) cannon, connecting with the soldier at the top of the staircase flanked by a guard and [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md). The guard's torso crumples forward and wraps around the cannonball, flying down onto the street and smearing against the ground. The cannonball continues under its momentum, crashing into a shop front on the other side of the road, shattering its glass window and embedding itself half way up its side wall.

The guard is thrown from the structure, falling 10ft and taking damage, almost knocking him out. He scrambles to his feet and darts into a nearby alley, too scared of the events transpiring to help any further.

## The Captain Arrives

[Vorkazal the Knife](../characters/vorkazal-the-knife.md), the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) captain in charge of the [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) sabotage steps forward out of the illusion of the catapult, standing confident and looking for a fight. He gives a rousing speech to his fellow soldiers, encouraging them to do their best while simultaneously striking fear into his enemies. He name drops himself, declaring their upcoming demise. The party's collective stomachs sink at the prospect of yet more challengers as they grow weaker from battle.

Around this time the remaining soldier on the structure moves to the second cannon. As he begins to ascend the stairs, [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) drops her Daylight spell, the coastal artillery briefly going pitch black before she casts Dawn directly between the middle cannons. The party see what appears to be an intense sunrise to the east, though the sharper eyed notice that the light is coming from the [Tour de la Côte](../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md). Blinding light befalls the area, including right where the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldier has just stepped. He burns up in the intense sunlight, setting fire in a burst of radiant flame that consumes him, killing him where he stands. The light remains in place for the rest of the battle.

The infiltrator bypasses the area of sunlight, making his way directly to the first cannon, still being guarded by the sole remaining cannoneer. Vētrall tries to stop him but struggles to see him in the darkness as he teleports around, giving him the slip.

The party turn their attention to Vorkazal. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) in wolf form rushes him, closely followed by the two remaining [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards. With two decisive swings of his Kavallos greatsword, Marik is taken out of her Wild Shape. She chooses to retreat and is replaced by [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) who leads the attack. It isn't long before Vorkazal hacks apart the two guards before him.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) pulls out a crossbow and joins [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) in taking shots at the captain. They begin to whittle him down as he is unable to avoid the incoming blows, pinned down by the guards and Kera in front of him. Marik throws Produce Flame at him, burning his face and eyebrows. He looks up at Marik and grins, relishing the challenge.

As the party continue to bombard the captain, Valan lets loose an arrow that skewers Vorkazal the Razor through his right eye, the arrowhead emerging through the back of his skull. Vorkazal looks at Marik once again and grins, relishing dying honourably in battle, before collapsing to the ground, defeated.

The infiltrator continues running for the first cannon, eager to finish the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md)'s mission while Vorkazal is the centre of attention. The cannoneer gulps and steps forward, protecting the bottom of the stairs with his spear. As the infiltrator turns to face him, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) fires a crossbow bolt through his ear which emerges through the other side, scattering his body to the stonework. The guard breathes a sigh of relief as he gets to live today.

*[Initiative order ends]*

## Infiltration Aftermath

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) runs over to [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) and gives him a big hug, yelling excitedly, happy that he is alive. Valan isn't thrilled at the attention. The party reconvenes on the coastal artillery structure.

They take a moment to loot the bodies. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) picks up [Vorkazal the Knife](../characters/vorkazal-the-knife.md)'s [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) greatsword, while Valan loots a [Kavallos Fleet Coin](../items/kavallos-fleet-coin.md) from his body.

Two [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards eventually make their way over. A high elf asks if the party is okay while the other, a purple tiefling with ram horns, begins to sob, collapsing to the ground under the emotional weight of what they've just witnessed. The high elf tries to console them before advising the party that they should report to the [Tour de la Côte](../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md) to report what happened here. The party agree and head there straight away.

On arriving at the base of the tower they are greeted by six [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards stationed outside at the top of the steps. When Vētrall tries to explain that they've been ordered to return, the lead guard is incredibly wary, telling them to leave, as tensions are running high and they don't know who to trust. One of the other guards cuts him off, recognising the party from their previous visit. He escorts them upstairs to see the arch-mage.

## Returning to the Arch-mage

The party is escorted upstairs to the arch-mage's chamber. Here they are left with two [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards who are stationed on either side of the room, half way down, and [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) who is on her knees by the window, looking out over [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md), one hand aloft and gently glowing white, focusing on the Daylight spell she has positioned over the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md).

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) steps forward to speak with Oriel but the guards step forward, unwilling to allow anyone to cross the middle of the room. Vētrall hesitates before taking to the arch-mage directly. They speak of the events that transpired, particularly their fight on the coastal artillery structure.

*[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md):*
> You were right.

Oriel lowers her hand, the light fading from it. She turns around, revealing reddened eyes and a moist face, indicating that she has been crying very recently.

*[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md):*
> I should have trusted you all. But I was wary, I hesitated.

*[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md):*
> I probably wouldn't have trusted us either. It was a tough call.

The arch-mage expresses her terror at the events that have played out, taking a sigh of relief when she finds out that not all of the cannons were destroyed. She is incredibly thankful for the party's efforts, despite the lack of help she provided them. The party is happy to have been of service, but warns of a potential incoming attack from the sea - if the coastal artillery had fallen, it would have been trivial for a naval bombardment to subdue to the town.

Having seen the immense power of [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) first hand during the battle, and with no love for elven society, [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) heavily criticises the arch-mage, accusing her of not doing enough to protect her people. If she had such magical power, why didn't she use more of it? Oriel explains that her abilities aren't limitless, and she did what she could. Valan states that she should have done more. Oriel retorts that leadership is incredibly difficult and he would likely have fared no better. He agrees, but is adamant that more should have been done to protect the town.

## Learning About the Sphere

[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) once again thanks the party for their services, and honours their original arrangement - they have earned her favour. The party debates what they would like from her.

Ultimately the party agree that information on [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md) would be best, as they don't know where else they might learn more of the mysterious metal orb. Looking at [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), Oriel declares that they can have one or the other - the arch-mage's favour not as generous following his disrespect.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) produces the sphere from their lead lined chest and presents it to Oriel, who asks if she can take it. With Vētrall's permission she does, examining it closely. She puts it to her ear and shakes it gently, having felt something moving. Doing so confirms to her that something within is loose and likely broken. She casts Detect Magic with her eyes closed, her other hand softly glowing white. She feels no magical presence from the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md), something she has never seen before.

Passing the sphere back to Vētrall, she declares that it is a [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md), one of the rarest of artifacts possessed by the Elves of Chausain, the elven society that were brought to [Astarus](../celestial-objects/astarus.md) by [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) during [the Second Coming](../history/events/the-second-coming.md). She explains that during the Fall of Chausain, [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) moved all of the elves in Chausain with only the clothes on their backs and possessions on their persons, so physical possessions from Chausain are inherently rare.

She explains that [memory spheres](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) are a form of magic that died with Chausain, with extremely few practitioners of the magic making it to [Astarus](../celestial-objects/astarus.md), let alone people alive today who have inherited the knowledge. [Memory spheres](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) were used to collect, store, and relive memories, created only by the most powerful arch-mages of the time. They allow the user to relive memories and prod at them, influencing how they play out, a useful tool for analysing a battle already fought, for example.

She also points out that this [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) is of finer construction than any she has seen before, though it appears to be broken due to the rattling sound coming from within.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) begin to realise that their sudden location change from [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) to a city wall may be related to this [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md). They ask Oriel about the sky and its two moons, a description that she recognises as being [Oonar](../celestial-objects/oonar.md), the planet that most life on [Astarus](../celestial-objects/astarus.md) originates from.

Their description of the city wall and the army marching in the dark below causes Oriel to chuckle as she realises they are recanting the story of the Fall of Chausain, tales of which are common on [Astarus](../celestial-objects/astarus.md) and in elven societies in particular. When Kera suggests that they were there, Oriel connects the dots, her head spinning at the possibility of what this [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) may be.

*[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md):*
> If what you're saying is true, this [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) may be of the single most important event in history.

Oriel explains that it now makes sense why the [Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) had them imprisoned, a sentence that puts the party on edge. She assuages their fears by pointing out the troubled relationship between [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md) and the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), contrasting their governance styles and goals in the wake of [the Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md), illustrating the inclusion and diversity of races present in [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md).

She tells the party that the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) believe that [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) are artifacts that belong to them, a sort of cultural heritage and birthright, as the Syntenne consider themselves the continuation of the Elves of Chausain and their ideals. As a result if word were to get out that she had seen [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md) and let the party leave with it, it would be "a diplomatic incident".

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) questions the loyalty of the two guards present in the room, to which Oriel responds that they are personally loyal to her and their trust is not to be questioned.

## Valan's Curse

After three separate admonishments by Valan, [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) declares that his attitude is unacceptable and raises her hands to cast a spell. The party declines to interfere as her hands glow white and she traces arcane symbols in the air while her eyes begin to glow. She casts [Geas](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/geas) on [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) for a period of 30 days:

*[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md):*
> You will treat authority figures with the respect they deserve, and be courteous while in their presence.

Valan's next words are ones of criticism, furious at the arch-mage for casting a spell on him. The effect of Geas kicks in, causing him to lose conscious immediately and collapse to the floor.

*[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md):*
> I hope that he swiftly learns some manners or this will be a common occurrence.

## [Oriel's Patronage](../storylines/oriels-patronage.md)

[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) offers the party a deal. If the party do not speak of their meeting and discussion of the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md), she will sponsor them on their quest to find out what it holds. In exchange she requests they share what they find with her:

*[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md):*
> If you learn anything, I want you to return to me so I can see it first hand.

The party agrees, happy for the assistance. Oriel asks what their group name is, but both sides of the party are dismissive, suggesting they aren't one cohesive unit.

*[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md):*
> You are now.

Oriel gets her guards to retrieve her "purse", returning after a few minutes with a small chest that appears to be filled with silver coins. She counts out 20 pp and places it in Vētrall's hand, Vētrall's eyes glowing as they realise the value of the platinum coins given to them. Oriel explains that this should help them with whatever their next steps may be.

Oriel then offers the party lodging for the evening, noting that they must be tired after such an eventful day. When they inquire about getting back to [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md), she points out that she has the means to transport them to any [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) capital city of their choosing. She causes the teleportation circle carved in her floor to begin glowing with a radiant white light. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) recognises its powerful arcane nature, but nobody recognises exactly what it is. The entire party is standing upon it.

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) talks of wishing to return to [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) before proceeding onwards. Oriel asks if Vētrall is a member of [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md). They reply by producing their [Coin of Family](../items/coins/coin-of-family.md). Oriel makes her way over to her table, opening a small ornate jewellery box placed to one side. She produces a [Coin of Friendship](../items/coins/coin-of-friendship.md), holding it up so Vētrall can see. Vētrall erupts into excitement, happy to have found another member of the family. Oriel tempers their excitement by explaining that they were offered membership in their youth but didn't accept, and now can't due to their role as arch-mage. Regardless she has visited [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) before, and so could likely teleport the party there if they wished.

The party discuss whether to stay the night in [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) or get teleported immediately and stay in [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md). Vētrall is aware of an inn that Marik and Kera can stay at, so they agree to depart at once.

[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) wakes [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) up with some healing magic before beginning to cast Teleportation Circle. She raises her hands, both glowing white to match her glowing white eyes. The runes carved into the floor glow brighter. Just before the spell is cast she wishes the party good luck:

*[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md):*
> May the blessings of the Judge Mother be upon you.

## Arriving in [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md)

In an instant the party arrives in [Trest Marketplace](../places/structures/trest-marketplace.md) in the early hours of the morning, the sky starting to look dark blue as the sun is hours away. Two [Coastguard](../organisations/guards/coastguard.md) observe the party's appearance in the middle of the empty marketplace, talking to each other in disbelief at what they've just seen. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) greets them, dismissing their appearance and telling the guards that they're [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) and will be on their way momentarily. The guards are happy to leave them be.

Vētrall lead [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) to [Nomad's Stop](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/nomads-stop.md), a local inn on the ring of buildings surrounding the marketplace. They paid 1 gp for their stay for the night, insisting they remained there until tomorrow when they would come by to collect them. The pair agreed, heading inside to get ready for a well earned rest.

## The Skimmers' Next Move

Kera and Marik grab a drink from the bar rather than turning in to sleep. They find a secluded table at the back of the tavern area, talking quietly amongst themselves.

They discuss what their plan is, noting that they have been compelled to return to [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) in [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) and will surely face consequences if they don't return to her with something. The pair consider completing their mission as requested - stealing the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) from Vētrall and returning it.

Kera notes what [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) said: that the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) likely don't know what was being held in the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md), so they may be able to return something else in its place. Unable to settle on a conclusive plan, the pair continue to think on their situation.

Kera expresses a dislike of [Creek](../characters/creek.md), not wishing to have to deal with him any further. Marik agrees but sees no way out of their current situation without being hunted. Kera tells Marik that he'd like to return to [Kuv'narash](../places/settlements/villages/kuvnarash.md) to "rake sand", calling it a simple but pleasant life. Marik tells Kera of her desire to retire to a mountainside where she can finally be at peace.

The pair muse over [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md), noting its supposed importance. They consider if they could steal it and simply sell it themselves, remembering the 1,000,000 gp figure [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) quoted. Could they sell it to the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md)? Should the Skimmers even possess an item of such importance? These questions would have to be answered another day.

Both Marik and Kera turn in for the night, sleeping right through.

*[Kera, Marik: long rest]*

## Returning to the Family

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) make their way through the narrow streets of [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) back to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md). Once at the top of the hill, Vētrall sees [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) at the door, having just started his shift for the day as Father of the Door.

He greets Vētrall, happy to see them return. Vētrall is tired and in no mood to converse, greeting Hanz dismissively. When Hanz asks what's wrong, Vētrall simply states that they will explain in the morning. Hanz lets the pair in, concerned but unwilling to press the matter at such an early hour.

Inside there are only a handful of people sat at the banquet table, most of which have ordered breakfast for an exceptionally early start to their days.

Vētrall and Valan make their own ways downstairs, finding empty cots away from each other to get a good night's rest in.

*[Valan, Vētrall: long rest]*

## Valan [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) Dream 1

During his sleep, Valan begins to dream. He finds himself standing on a grassy hill overlooking the [Gulf of Tanelle](../places/topography/seas-bays/gulf-of-tanelle.md) from where [Arrepont](../places/settlements/cities/arrepont.md) would be. It is dark but illuminated by the moon to the west, the reflection of which can be seen illuminating the gulf and its river branches to the north and south. The grass surrounding him is long and blows gently in the night breeze, moving like the surface of the water.

Valan observes the moon which begins to turn pink and finally magenta, glowing so bright that all surface details fade into a single uniform magenta disc. A female voice echoes around the space as it talks to Valan:

*[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md):*
> I'm still waiting for you.

*[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md):*
> Who are you? What are you? Where am I? What do you want with me?

*[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md):*
> You will see in time. You're on the right path.

*[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md):*
> The path to where?

*[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md):*
> The path home.

The moon reverts to its typical white state. Valan's vision goes black as the dream ends.

## An Unexpected Visitor

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) wakes in the late hours of the morning, having slept well. They awaken to find [Nacnar Morwesyrr](../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md) standing in their room, armoured and holding her double-bladed scimitar.

*[Nacnar Morwesyrr](../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md):*
> You're late getting up.

Vētrall shoots out of bed and embraces Nacnar in a big hug. She drops her weapon and tentatively reciprocates for a moment. Vētrall rambles, happy to see their mentor after so long.

*[Nacnar Morwesyrr](../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md):*
> I'm late.

It takes a while for Vētrall to understand what Nacnar means, eventually realising she is torn up about not being here for [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) when he died, and also missing his funeral. 

Nacnar is insistent that Vētrall eats some breakfast before recanting her adventures, so the pair make their way upstairs. [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) is awake by this point. He sees Vētrall and an unknown figure head upstairs, but opts to stay in his cot a while longer.

Vētrall takes a seat at one end of the table where it is quieter. A huge spread of breakfast food is still available, and [Treefrightener](../characters/aneni-veomelo.md) can be seen down the opposite end of the room engaged in jovial conversation with someone else sat at the table. Nacnar sits next to Vētrall and waits patiently while they enthusiastically scarf bacon and eggs.

Valan gets up and makes his way to the banquet table, searching up and down for his friend [Eight Trees](../characters/eight-trees.md). He eventually spots him on the opposite of the table, waving back in a friendly manner. Valan dashes around to the other side, taking a seat next to him. Eight produces a potato for him from his robe, which Valan accepts graciously. The pair talk like old friends, Eight asking Valan if he has seen any halflings yet, but he has not.

Vētrall and Nacnar begin talking. Nacnar explains that she was in [the Dragonbrand](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/the-dragonbrand.md) "visiting friends" when she learned of Geen's death, racing back as soon as she could, but was too late.

*[Nacnar Morwesyrr](../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md):*
> He was always there for me. I wasn't there for him when he passed.

Vētrall assures her that Geen would have understood, but she takes it as a strong personal failing, equating it to a betrayal of his friendship. Vētrall wishes she wasn't so hard on herself.

Nacnar changes the subject, noting that Vētrall apparently now has a student of their own. Vētrall is dismissive of both the notion and of Valan until Nacnar insists they retrieve him. Vētrall locates Valan who is still deep in conversation with [Eight Trees](../characters/eight-trees.md). They are annoyed that Valan has bonded to a random [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) member better than them. They ask Valan to accompany them. When Valan doesn't come immediately, Nacnar gives Vētrall the hurry up, causing Vētrall to insist to Valan that he meets their own mentor.

Nacnar and Valan meet, Valan giving a formal greeting as a mark of respect, one that Nacnar repays in kind. When Nacnar asks what they have been up to since being united, Vētrall asks if they can go somewhere more private to talk. Nacnar offers their house ([Nacnar's House](../places/buildings/houses/nacnars-house.md)) in [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md), which Vētrall accepts eagerly. The three leave [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md), heading across [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) around midday.

## [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) in [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md)

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) also wake around late morning, coming downstairs in [Nomad's Stop](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/nomads-stop.md) for breakfast and ale. They sit at a round table near the front with extra chairs.

From here they observe [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) enter the inn and head over to the bar to order breakfast and ale in a borrowed voice. While taking out silver to pay, she drops the coins to the floor, scrambling to pick them up.

*[Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md):*
> Fuck nugget!

Kera and Marik's curiosity is piqued at the swearing kenku. She pays before rushing away from the bar, clearly flustered. She sits at the first table she finds - the pair's. They look upon her suspiciously, inherently untrusting of kenku due to their association with the criminal underworld.

They watch on as her food arrives. [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) tucks into the scrambled eggs and toast messily, grabbing handfuls and struggling to stuff it into her beak comfortably.

Marik uses Skimmersign to ask her about the weather.

*[Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md):*
> What a load of shite.

Marik gets up to move to another table, prompting [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) to reply in Skimmersign. Marik sits back down. The kenku doesn't say much, but pushes her plate away from her once around half finished. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) collects it and begins to finish off the meal.

[Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) stands up and makes her way over to the door, waiting there for the pair to follow, which they both do. Kera takes the plate of food with him. They follow the kenku outside as she begins to lead them through the maze-like side streets of [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md), heading downhill.

As [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) disappears around one corner, Marik gets a bad feeling, silently urging Kera to slow down as she checks for an ambush of some kind. Seeing no danger from the windows of the buildings or along [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) they continue, rounding the corner. [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) is nowhere to be seen. A moment later she descends from the rooftop above, wings outstretched. She parrots "shit yourself" once more before skipping down the street. The pair are perplexed by her behaviour but follow on reluctantly.

After a few more turns Kera suggests that they stop following the kenku. The pair wait for her to turn a corner, watching to see what happens next. [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) walks backwards to the intersection again, pointing her wing down [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) she had turned into. The pair continue to follow.

As they round the corner, [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) is once again nowhere to be seen. In front of them they see [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) make a 45 degree turn to the right, a wooden fence on the opposite side of [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) where the turn is. Directly in front of them is an open gate in that fence. They take it as a sign and proceed inside.

## An Alley Ambush

Once inside the gate is pushed closed by [Viola](../characters/viola.md). She introduces herself, welcoming the pair to [Trest](../places/settlements/towns/trest.md), seemingly aware of who they both are. She explains that she has something for them, pointing over to a chest on the opposite side of the back yard, where [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) is hunched over, her wings obscuring their view of the chest itself.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) approaches [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) to see what's in the chest. As he does, the kenku pulls a dagger from under her wing and lunges towards him. [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) watches [Viola](../characters/viola.md) as she pulls out a mace, intent on striking her.
