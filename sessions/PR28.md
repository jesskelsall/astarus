## Finding [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) emerge from [the alley](../places/buildings/shops/the-alley.md) connecting [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/government/tenterfell-house.md) to the main street of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/settlements/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md). Knowing that they need to find [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) in the city's [Sunrise District](../places/settlements/districts/sunrise-district.md). [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), having spent some time in the district during her downtime, leads the party. For the rest of them this is their first time here since they sneaked into [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md) while seeking [sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) tries to ask some of the locals for help. They recognise her as the "Grey Giant" from [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md), causing an inquisitive crowd of people to form around the party. She cautions the crowd with her halberd, clearing some space.

She asks for directions to the nearest inn. A commoner tells her that [Lionel's Rest](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/lionels-rest.md) can be found a bit further down the main road coming out of the eastern [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) gatehouse. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) suggests asking the crowd about [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) and [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md). Torbra asks about the former and gets no response, so [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks about the latter.

A few people step forward, having heard of the adventuring party. The party is told about a sign outside of [The Dog's Groke](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md). Torbra tips the male commoner telling the party this 1 sp, causing several beggars to surge forward, offering their hands. The party takes off down the street to avoid the crowd.

As the party gets closer, they ask another commoner on the streets about [the Dog's Groke](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md). It becomes clear that it is an inn that has closed down.

## Breaking and Entering

As the party arrives outside of [the Dog's Groke](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md), they observe a relatively well kept exterior, but with paint smeared on the inside of the windows, intentionally obscuring the view of inside. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) takes a look through the window, seeing a dishevelled and abandoned looking interior with clutter. She hears faint talking coming from inside. Saoirse takes a look for herself.

Saoirse asks how they should proceed. When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) suggests they merely knock on the front door, she does. There is no answer, so Saoirse loses her patience and casts Eldritch Blast at the door, barely damaging it and creating a loud banging sound. Realising she should have tried the door handle, Saoirse finds it locked. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) opts to try putting her foot through the door. As she kicks it she hears the sound of wood cracking.

Saoirse and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) decide to circle the building and look for another entrance.

Round the front, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) kicks the door again, breaking the door from the wrought iron door handle and lock. Torbra swan dives through the nearest paned glass window, shattering the glass and cutting herself in the process.

Saoirse and Thanea find a door on one of the narrow sides of the building. Hearing glass being broken, they decide to act quickly. Saoirse casts Eldritch Blast at this door, shattering it into several pieces. Thanea proceeds inside, finding a disused living area with a double bed, coated throughout with dust. A closed door leads further inside. Saoirse tries to keep an eye on the surrounding area but is too distracted by the quickly developing break-in.

Torbra finds herself in the inn's ground floor tavern, complete with tables and a bar. The room is partially dusty and undisturbed, while in other places cluttered items have been left. The tables and chairs are arranged haphazardly.

## Confronting Janneke

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) catches the sound of [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) beginning to come down the stairs from above, stopping half way down once she has a clear view of the room.

*[Initiative order begins]*

Janneke readies an arrow at Torbra while holding station on the stairs. Torbra tries to talk her down. Janneke is furious that they've broken in, giving the sense that she opted not to answer the door. Torbra explains that the party is looking for [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md). Janneke retorts that they've found them and pulls her bow tighter.

Torbra reacts by running over to the stairs, hoping to hamper Janneke's line of sight. She takes this as a hostile action, running down the stairs before sinking two arrows into Torbra's chest, then shouting at Torbra to get out.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) peeks through the window that Torbra jumped through, raising her voice to ask what's going on inside, revealing her presence. She tries to convince Janneke to stop, pointing out that the party is [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md), before climbing through the window. At a similar time [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) open up the door into the tavern, similarly emerging to ask that hostilities end.

It becomes clear to Janneke that she is outnumbered. At Thanea's request she puts her longbow down, apologising profusely and looking scared. Torbra takes her frustration out on the tavern table with her halberd, denting it.

*[Initiative order ends]*

Janneke tells the party that they can take anything they want, showing that she believes they are thieves breaking in. Saoirse suggests everyone calms down and enjoy a drink, so Janneke grabs a jug of ale that she had hidden behind the bar and sits at one of the tables.

Thanea beckons Torbra over to the bar. She tells Torbra to distract Janneke while she tries to read her thoughts. Torbra agrees to the plan. Thanea casts Detect Thoughts to read Janneke's surface level thoughts, using the Subtle Spell metamagic to cast it undetected. Janneke's first thoughts are of panic.

Torbra sits across from Janneke while Saoirse touches Torbra's shoulder to cast Cure Wounds on her. Torbra begins her interrogation. Janneke makes it clear that she thought the party were breaking in, justifying her not answering the door. Thanea sees memories of Janneke gaining the key to the inn through a hidden dealing with the landlord. She also sees a very recent memory of Janneke watching [Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) tend to [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) in bed, clearly looking ill.

Saoirse asks who Janneke is referring to when saying "we", to which she claims to be talking about [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) as a group in the abstract. Saoirse pointedly asks where the rest of the group are. Janneke lies, claiming they aren't here. Saoirse believes her. Thanea sees a memory of Kieran covering Slaine's mouth - the group responding to [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s break-in.

Saoirse wanders over to the bar, finding 3 day rations. Questioning Janneke about why she needs so many, Janneke lies that it is merely 3 days of her own supply.

Thanea sees a memory of [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) sat around the lit fire pit in the centre of the inn. Kieran and Janneke are enjoying jovial conversation, but Slaine is distant, lost in his own world of examining the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md).

## Not Alone Here

While this is going on, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) sneaks upstairs. She sees all of the rooms except one are closed, hearing a shush sound coming from that room. Looking at the floor she can see footprints for 3 people going between 3 rooms, including the room with the open door.

Downstairs, Saoirse asks Janneke if she can look around, heading towards the stairs. Janneke gets noticeably panicked, trying to cut a deal for information but failing. She gives in and tells the party that the other two members of [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) are upstairs. She makes it clear that one of them ([Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md)) isn't well, and begs them not to hurt either of them.

Torbra presses for details of the illness. Thanea speaks up, suggesting that [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) may have fought [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) themselves. Janneke does her best to describe how Slaine has been acting weird and Kieran has been unable to do anything to help him.

Thanea asks Janneke about the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) and the [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). Janneke has no knowledge of the creatures and is clearly confused. She starts to make the connection between the party of [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) in front of her and [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) & [Astral squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md). Thanea can see half-forgotten memories of Janneke meeting with Elysia.

Saoirse creates a copy of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) using Minor Illusion, asking Janneke if she has seen something like this. When she confirms that this looks like what Slaine has in his possession, Torbra is taken aback while Saoirse expresses concern for his safety. Saoirse immediately heads upstairs.

Thanea catches more memories from Janneke:

- Slaine on the roof of [the Dog's Groke](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md) at night, lying down and staring at the starry sky.
- [The Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) around the fire. Kieran tries taking the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) from Slaine, causing him to start punching him repeatedly.

## Upstairs Revealed

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) approaches the open door. As she turns the corner she finds [Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) staring back at her, with [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) lying in bed at the back of the room. He is visibly unwell, with a healing broken nose and stitches on his jaw. He is staring at the ceiling.

*[Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md):*
> Please, they're not well. Please don't come in. Please.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) offers to provide healing to Slaine, but Kieran refuses, telling [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) that he has tried everything he knows. Kieran is non-confrontational but his presence near the doorway suggests that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is not welcome.

When [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) arrives upstairs she starts opening up the other rooms and rifling through their contents, looking for the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). In the second room she finds Slaine's notebook. Flipping it open she finds it 3/4 full of talented drawings of various subjects: urban scenes, still life, portraits, natural landscapes. She flips to the end to look for meteoric scenes but doesn't find any.

## Continued Questioning

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) continues questioning [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) with [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md). Thanea suggests that the three of them head upstairs. Janneke continues to protect her group, suggesting that they stay downstairs where she could tell Thanea everything. Thanea gets impatient, asking her why she is so strongly against people talking to Kieran and Slaine, especially as it would get [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) out of their hair quicker.

Thanea sees more of Janneke's memories:

- Slaine drawing a sword on a [Sunrise District](../places/settlements/districts/sunrise-district.md) commoner who dared get too close to his [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md).
- Kieran praying before casting healing magic on a bed-ridden commoner, his wounds closing up.

Thanea implores Janneke to start trusting them, pointing out how easy it is to read her and the situation. She impresses upon Janneke their experience and the danger that Slaine may be in. Janneke notes Thanea's persistence before starting to cry, giving in to the party's demands. She has no idea what to do any more.

Thanea opts to head upstairs while Torbra stays downstairs to keep an eye on Janneke.

## Slaine Perks Up

[Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) tries to close the door on [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). Around this time Thanea arrives upstairs and looks into Slaine's room. She appeals to Kieran, explaining that they are [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) that are here to help and are aware of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) in Slaine's possession.

Kieran reluctantly allows one person to join him in the room. Thanea explains to him that Slaine likely touched the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) in [Silethwaite](../places/settlements/villages/silethwaite.md) which is causing his illness. The pair converse about [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md)' experiences in [Silethwaite](../places/settlements/villages/silethwaite.md) - no new information is learned.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) checks on Slaine. He is not lucid and mutters to himself:

*[Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md):*
> Janneke, is that you? Don't let them near me, don't let them take it. It's mine, I found it.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) introduces herself and her intent to try and help him recover. As soon as she does, he stares right at her before curling into a fetal position with the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) clasped between his knees and chest.

*[Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md):*
> Get away! Get out of here! It's mine, you won't take it!!

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) backs away while continuing to reassure him that they won't take his [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), and that they're only here to help. The commotion catches the attention of everyone in the building. Saoirse puts Slaine's book down and crosses the landing. [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) leaps up from her chair and sprints up the stairs. Torbra follows her up at a less hurried pace.

Saoirse gets her first view of the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md). She feels a magical presence from both it and Slaine, dull but similar to how she felt while unconscious in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) and while under the effect of the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). Slaine sees her stepping into the doorway and explodes again, clutching the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) tighter:

*[Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md):*
> Get away! Get her away from me! It's mine, it's not hers, it's mine. It's mine. It's mine!

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) can see that Slaine is petrified and is acting in a feral manner. She casts Detect Magic:

| Source | Strength | School(s) of Magic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) | High | Transmutation |
| [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) (entire body) | Medium | Transmutation, Evocation |

Saoirse steps back out of the room and casts Charm Person on Slaine, succeeding. This calms him down only slightly - he is still afraid that Saoirse will take his [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), but some lucidity about his situation reveals itself.

She empathises with Slaine, telling him that she has had similar experiences. He finds this comforting. He asks "how you got it off", referring to the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) which has already fused to his hand, a fact that has yet to become apparent to the party. Saoirse misses the detail. Her demeanour is positive and encouraging which Slaine appreciates.

[Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) arrives at the room, pushing Saoirse out of the way and quietly but sternly ushering [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) out of the room immediately. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) takes the opportunity to suggest that everyone go back downstairs so they can discuss the situation. Everyone but Saoirse immediately complies. She asks Slaine's permission to stay with him for a while, but he refuses, worried that he will hurt her. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) then ushers her downstairs with everyone else.

## Discussions Downstairs

Both groups assemble downstairs to discuss. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) presents a theory that the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) is draining Slaine's life essence, so it is essential that they take it from him. Thanea explains that touching these [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) is very dangerous.

Janneke tells the party that Slaine found the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) in a clearing in the [Great Sile Woods](../places/topography/forests/great-sile-woods.md) near [Silethwaite](../places/settlements/villages/silethwaite.md). The clearing looked like it was logged by hand. There were signs that it had been occupied for a time, but there was no indications of by what. Not realising the significance of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), Janneke let Slaine keep it, assuming he would sell it, but he kept it and grew obsessed with it.

Thanea shows Janneke her [Meteoric Map of Astor](../maps/meteoric-map-of-astor.md) and gets her to point out where she thinks the clearing may be. She points at [Silethwaite](../places/settlements/villages/silethwaite.md).

Saoirse asks how long ago they found the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). Janneke reveals that they've had the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) for 4 or 5 months, which shocks [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). Kieran explains that Slaine can't be without the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), which is familiar to Saoirse and Thanea. He clarifies that he is physically unable to let go of it.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) theorises about how they could remove the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) from Slaine, including taking drastic action and removing his hand. She wonders if it is physically bound to his hand or if the magic prevents him from choosing to let go.

[Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) speaks up to express an idea. He hesitantly confides in the party that he is a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), urging them to keep it to themselves. Due to their experience as [magicborn on the run](../storylines/ended/magicborn-on-the-run.md) from the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md), they reassure him that they will not betray his trust. Kieran tells the party that he knows how to cast Dispel Magic. He hasn't tried using it yet for fear of hurting or killing Slaine in the process, but he is getting desperate and Slaine is only getting worse. The party agrees to the course of action.

## Attempting a Dispel

Kieran agrees to have [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) in the room when he attempts to dispel the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md)'s magic. [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) chooses to stay downstairs, wanting no part in this.

| Character | Position |
| --- | --- |
| [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) | Lying in bed. |
| [Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) | Standing next to bed. |
| [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) | Behind Kieran. |
| [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) | Across the landing with a view of the room. |
| [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) | Top of the stairs, down the hall. |
| [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) | On the landing near the room. |
| [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) | Downstairs. |

[Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) has returned to a calm trance-like stare up at the ceiling. Kieran approaches him and kneels down at his bedside.

*[Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md):*
> Kieran, is that you?

*[Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md):*
> Yes my brother. How do you feel?

*[Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md):*
> They're not here to take it, are they?

*[Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md):*
> No they're not. We're going to try something, okay?

*[Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md):*
> What are you going to try? Are you going to touch it? What are you doing??

Slaine begins to get erratic again as Kieran begins to cast Dispel Magic. As the magic leaves his hands, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) watches as the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) loses its solid spherical form, collapsing into a pile of dust. The room fills with purple light and the dust begins to swirl around and over the bed.

Within a few seconds all of the dust has adhered to Slaine, coating his entire body in the familiar dark grey tone. He opens his eyes, revealing two glowing purple eyes, before he stands up from the bed.

The [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md) pulls its arms away from its chest, revealing that from the elbow down the arms have been reformed into bladed appendages, made of the same [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). It plunges both blades down towards the closest person in the room, Kieran.
