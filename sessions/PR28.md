### Arrival

- Front door is locked.
- Entire group is upstairs.
  - Slaine in bed being treated by Kieran.
  - Janneke looking on concerned from the hall.
- Janneke wants to be left alone. Bad time.

### Silethwaite

- Heard rumours of locals being attacked by strange creatures.
- Saw a trapper that had been cut up pretty badly. Survived.
- Had been trapping near the woods.
- Found a clearing in the woods.
  - Looked like the trees were cut down.
  - No sign of a crater or natural disturbance.
  - Slaine found the "ball".

### Slaine's Condition

- Account of behaviour:
  - Janneke:
    - He won't leave the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) alone.
    - Gets angry and sometimes violent when she tries getting him to part with it.
  - Kieran:
    - Increasingly distant. Climbs on the roof a lot.
    - Keeps imagining things.
    - Losing weight, running a fever.
- Current state:
  - In bed at Kieran's request.
  - Has a bad fever.
  - Won't let go of the "ball".
  - Tried healing (including disease & conditions).
  - At a loss of what to do.

### Party Reaction

- Not happy about being disturbed.
- Respectful of the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) - don't want trouble.
- Janneke not good at hiding that something bad is afoot.
- Kieran nervous around [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Unwilling to talk about healing and efforts so far.
- Actions:
  - Try to take [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) away - fused to hand, Slaine transforms.
  - Saoirse in view - goes ballistic.
- Slaine talking:
  - "They're coming for us."
  - "It's mine, get your hands off of it!"
  - (Saoirse) "Get her away from me, it's mine! She can't have it!"

### Combat

- Janneke tries to stop the party from attacking Slaine.
- Kieran still thinks he can save Slaine. Uses Dispel Magic and Cure Wounds to disrupt the party.
  - Can be convinced to fight along side them.
