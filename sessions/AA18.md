## Seeking a Chalice

Deep inside [Devdaha Crypt](../places/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md), [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) are fighting for their lives in the chalice trial, overwhelmed by the number of chitine present in the room. Having destroyed two [Quartz Chalices](../items/magic/quartz-chalice.md) with seemingly no effect to the endlessly arriving enemies descending from magical darkness above each pedestal, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) races across the middle of the room in search of a chalice to test a theory on. She has figured out the theming of the room - that it relates to her Starry Form: Chalice, which is currently active.

*[Initiative order resumes]*

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) shouts back at [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), warning her not to follow her too far into the room as she tries to grab a chalice. Ephaine then casts Misty Step, appearing next to the chalice in the right hand wing of the room. As soon as she arrives she grabs the chalice, finding it cold to the touch. She prepares for incoming attacks from the chitine surrounding her, ready to dodge.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) re-enters the room from the corridor and casts Eldritch Blast on one of the chitine in the middle of the room, hitting with a critical hit, dealing it a wound strong enough to dislodge sinew and fur from around its neck. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) turns to that same chitine that is within melee range, using Chilling Rend to transform her arm into a corporeal shadowy blade, slicing the chitine clean in half before her arm turns back into its usual shadow.

A chitine emerges from the ceiling above Ahsha, drawing three daggers as it hits the floor. Ahsha strikes twice at the other chitine in front of her, finishing it off with her second greataxe strike. It crumples to the ground, banging its head on the pedestal as it goes.

From the corridor [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) casts Toll the Dead on the other chitine, the dolorous sound of her hitting her mace off her shield ringing through its mind. As it reels from the sound, Korina casts Healing Word on Ahsha.

The chitine in front of Ahsha stabs her twice. The chitine near Ephaine move closer to her, two of the slowed chitine managing to reach melee range, but none of the three are able to land a hit on her as she dodges. The other chitine in the centre of the room surround [Nills](../characters/nills.md), five attacking simultaneously. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) is punctured 8 times, once critically. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) looks back at Noon as she dissipates into smoke on the breeze, vanishing from the centre of the room. The chitine that were frightened of her are no longer held back.

Ephaine casts Misty Step to return to the top of the stairs nearest the entry door, evading the chitine in the right hand wing of the room. She casts Star Mote (Produce Flame) on the chitine near the pedestal closest to the doorway, finishing it off after the damage Korina inflicted upon it. Ephaine races back towards the door, reaching Ahsha and Noon.

Noon casts Summon Shadowspawn (despair) to summon [Nills](../characters/nills.md) at the top of the staircase towards the party who are now all by the entrance doorway, urging her to return to the fray:

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Don't think your duty's quite done, dear sister!

Noon retreats back into the corridor, joining Korina there. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) holds her action, waiting for more chitine to draw closer before screaming. More chitine descend from the ceiling, one each landing right next to both Ahsha and Ephaine. Ahsha wastes no time slashing the one next to her twice, ending its life as quickly as it appeared. She then circles round Ephaine, getting ready to attack the other chitine.

Korina casts Toll the Dead on that chitine, dealing a moderate amount of damage. More chitine from the middle of the room rush up to the wing the party occupies. Some rush past [Nills](../characters/nills.md) while others from deeper in the room just make it to the top of the staircase. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) then reacts by using Dreadful Scream, striking fear into many of the chitine around the party. Unfortunately Ahsha also feels a shiver going down her spine, the sound of [Nills](../characters/nills.md) terrifying her too, making it harder for her to act decisively while [Nills](../characters/nills.md) remains in view.

Three chitine attack Ahsha (2 hits), three attack Ephaine (3 hits, including one critical hit), and the chitine that reached the corridor attacks Noon, hitting once. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) attracts three chitine, taking 5 hits, losing more than half of its health.

## An Accidental Revelation

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) casts Healing Word on herself and adds to the healing magic through Starry Form: Chalice. As she does so the [Quartz Chalice](../items/magic/quartz-chalice.md) in her hand begins to glow so brightly with white-yellow radiance that it resembles an inverse silhouette, only the outline of its chalice shape perceivable. Focused on Ephaine a larger than normal Moonbeam spell begins, bathing the surrounding area in harsh radiant light. Immediately she begins to burn in this light, taking radiant damage, surprising her and changing the plan in her head.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) notices as the magical darkness on the roof above this pedestal burns off in the radiant light created by the Moonbeam.

Moments before Ephaine had intended to run out of the room, but instead disengages and begins heading deeper into the room, pushing past a chitine to get by. As she moves the Moonbeam follows her, keeping her within its radiant light. Ahsha is highly confused, shouting after Ephaine, demanding to know where she is going.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) brazenly casts Eldritch Blast at the chitine in front of him in the corridor, hitting it once, the other blast going off early into the floor. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) gets scorched by the Moonbeam they now find themself in. The light burns shadow from their being which races away from their exterior to the opposite side, flying off in wisps. Quickly they start looking less corporeal. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) leaps onto the empty pedestal, using Chilling Rend to slice down at one of the chitine below, ripping a heavy blow across its chest. Another chitine drops down from the ceiling in the right hand wing of the room.

Ahsha, now confused by what the plan is and surrounded by chitine, disengages back towards the corridor, clumsily pushing past the chitine back there. She starts shouting to try and lure the chitine to her. Again [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) casts Toll the Dead on the chitine, finishing it off, causing it to collapse into Noon's lap before hitting the floor hard. She moves into the doorway, realising that she's in just the right spot if she wanted to try and close it again.

The chitine continue to swarm over the closest wing of the room, moving mostly towards Korina, some surrounding [Nills](../characters/nills.md) and Ephaine. Across the room some from the furthest wings step down into the central area, preparing for the incoming Ephaine. Three chitine that move towards Ephaine take heavy damage from the Moonbeam, barely clinging on but determined to stab. Three chitine stab Ephaine (4 hits), wounding her severely. Two stab [Nills](../characters/nills.md) (3 hits), causing her to fade from existence again. Korina is stabbed by 3 chitine, only 2 hits connecting.

As Ephaine continues to burn from the Moonbeam focused on her, she casts Healing Word before disengaging, sliding down into the central area and rushing towards the stairs up to the left hand wing. As she begins ascending she finds three chitine already surrounding her.

Noon casts Eldritch Blast between Korina and the door frame, hitting the chitine in front of her, staggering it into the chitine behind it, wounding it heavily. Ahsha gets Korina's attention, demanding to swap places with her. Korina uses her breath weapon on four chitine beyond the doorway, one that has already been damaged collapses as its frozen foot shatters, seizing up and collapsing. Happy with her efforts she retreats, Ahsha seamlessly moving into her spot in the doorway, using Second Wind as she goes to prepare for incoming damage. Korina casts Healing Word on herself to recover from the puncture wounds.

More chitine race forwards to the doorway, a total of five now swarming Ahsha's position, the three closest to her puncturing her three times. As more move to surround Ephaine, five are caught in the Moonbeam that envelops her, two dying at her feet. The remaining three descend upon her, stabbing her five times. She clenches as she fears the worst, expecting not to weather the dagger strikes, but barely remains standing after the Moonbeam's damage is applied.

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) gently places the [Quartz Chalice](../items/magic/quartz-chalice.md) on the middle of one of the steps below her before disengaging up, reaching the left hand wing's pedestal. She places her hand to the chalice and casts Healing Word on herself. As she does the chalice begins to glow, casting a Moonbeam centred on it. A cascade of radiant light spills down from the chalice to the pedestal, amplifying the Moonbeam, expanding its radius wide enough to encompass this entire wing of the room. She looks up past the almost blinding light, watching as the magical darkness on the ceiling above recedes and vanishes entirely, flat and unremarkable stonework revealed in its place, giving no impression of a space above this room. The second Moonbeam begins to burn Ephaine.

Noon attempts to cast Eldritch Blast through the doorway but misses the chitine on the other side with both blasts. Ahsha continues hacking at whichever chitine steps up to the doorway, slicing the one in front, slicing off two of its arms, downing it instantly. She continue the greataxe movement into the chitine next to it, catching it below one of its armpits, it bleeding heavily. Korina attempts to catch Toll the Dead on one of the chitine but the spell doesn't take.

The remaining four chitine continue to surge towards the doorway. Half of the chitine in the centre of the room charge towards Ephaine on the left hand wing, running into one of the two active Moonbeams focused on the glowing chalices, two of which die in the process. The remaining one strikes at Ephaine, piercing her twice with heavy hits. Ahsha gets bombarded by three chitine, weathering three strikes.

## Retreating to the Corridor

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md), struggling to continue to weather the sustained Moonbeam radiance, casts Cure Wounds on herself and grabs the [Quartz Chalice](../items/magic/quartz-chalice.md) from the pedestal. As the radiant glow cascading down the pedestal fades, the Moonbeam shrinking down a size. Ephaine looks up to check the ceiling, not seeing any magical darkness reappearing in this moment. As she begins her retreat the chitine near her sinks a dagger into her side.

Ephaine races down into the central area, vaulting down the 5ft drop. She lands poorly, feeling her feet falling out from underneath her as she begins to tumble forwards. She prioritises protecting the chalice, turning her upper body so that she impacts with her shoulder, the chalice remaining intact as she lands on her back, prone.

[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) continues to cast Eldritch Blast at the chitine beyond the doorway, pummelling the one in front of [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md). Ahsha looks across the room as yet more chitine descend from the two remaining spots of magical darkness. She swings at the chitine in front of her, finishing it with her second swing. Seeing Ephaine running around in the room, she shouts towards her:

*[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> We've gotta get out of here and come back later!

[Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) casts Toll the Dead on a chitine she recognises as having taken a hit already, finishing it off, before she looks into the room and casts Shield of Faith on the prone Ephaine.

Several of the chitine in Ephaine's vicinity charge towards her, unhappy at her taking the chalice and seeing a good opportunity to attack someone who is already down. Four move into the Moonbeam surrounding her, all burning up before they get a chance to strike. The remaining two in front of Ahsha collectively only manage to land one hit.

Ahsha encourages Ephaine as she weathers more radiant damage while standing. She casts Misty Step to teleport to the pedestal nearest the entrance door, setting the chalice upon it. As she does it lights up the pedestal, expanding the Moonbeam's glow. Not seeing a way to get through the doorway past a chitine, Ahsha and Korina, she opts to cower in the corner of the wing, managing to avoid the blast of radiant energy from the chalice. She hurls a Star Mote (Produce Flame) at the chitine in front of Ahsha, finishing it off.

Noon repositions, getting a line of sight on the last chitine surging towards the door. Taking cues from Korina he flicks his dagger like a tuning fork, casting Toll the Dead. The chitine resists the effect. More chitine appear across the room.

Ahsha opts to retreat to clear a hole for Ephaine to get out of the room through, squeezing past Korina who casts Toll the Dead on the chitine which collapses to the ground, steam emitting from the cleansing radiant energy.

More chitine begin to race across the room to challenge the repeating party, three attempting to surround Ephaine. Two collapse in the Moonbeam, only one managing to reach her with a dash.

Ephaine casts Healing Word on herself before casting Interstellar Medium (Frostbite) on the chitine next to her, icing it over and finishing it off. The path now clear to the doorway, she endures the Moonbeam to get out of the room.

Ahsha wastes no time stepping up to close the door. Ephaine casts Guidance and Korina casts Enhance Ability (Bull's Strength), allowing her to heave it closed easily. She moves her fingers out of the way in time before it slams back into its original position, the room finally closed.

## Safety At Last

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) collapses to the ground in the doorway, exhausted from the ordeal. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) begins profusely apologising, feeling guilty for dragging everyone into this and putting them in danger, suggesting they could leave and return to their [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission ([Rescue Kiln Squad](../storylines/rescue-kiln-squad.md)).

Ahsha wonders if they could return to [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) and at least make the villagers aware that this place exists. Ephaine isn't sure if anyone would even know about it - she certainly wasn't told of its existence growing up, believing that no [Cepine](../lineages/cepine.md) have been here in a long time if ever.

Ahsha's main concern is the chitine themselves, wondering if they might break out from this place and threaten [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md). Ephaine isn't sure, but suggests that they could tackle the room again after resting from their injuries, especially now that she has a decent idea of how to neutralise the chitine effectively. She expresses deep regret that her curiosity almost got everyone killed, her fear of the place now apparent.

The party agrees that rest is the first priority. Ephaine offers to stay up and keep watch, but Ahsha and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) are vocal about her getting rest, noting that she looks injured and tired.

When Noon offers to keep watch as he doesn't need the rest, Ahsha and Ephaine show a renewed surprise that he doesn't even need to sleep, Ephaine relating her pleasant experiences with rejuvenation through restful sleep. Noon states that he's never slept in his life, astonishing Ahsha.

While everyone is calming down, they each take individual moments to look and listen to the doorway, wondering what's going on within now that they've left. After a few minutes the slight radiant glow peeking through the minute gaps between the stone door and the surrounding thick stone doorway vanishes as the Quartz Crystal on the closest pedestal stops glowing, the healing magic no longer sustaining its Moonbeam. Ephaine is confident that she doesn't hear chitine racing towards the door - the room grows ominously silent.

Ephaine relays what she doesn't hear to the party, her and Ahsha theorising that the chitine within aren't an immediate threat to them or in terms of breaking out into the surrounding lands. Ahsha encourages everyone to eat and get some sleep, Ephaine imploring the party to try conquering the room again afterwards.

Ephaine casts Augury, consulting the star chart on whether the party should go back into the room and attempt to activate the remaining two chalices (weal). The party eats, thinking on how the encounter went and what they might do differently next time.

| Character(s) | Shift | Observations |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) | 4h | Unremarkable. Cold and silent. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) makes no appearance. |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md)<br>[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | 4h | Quiet except for subtle wind reverberations from the tunnel.<br>Faint sound of multiple things shuffling beyond the door, details unknown. |

During their watch, Ahsha and Ephaine chat again about the situation they find themselves in, the nature of this crypt and how old it seems, incongruent with Ephaine's understanding of [Cepine](../lineages/cepine.md) history. She speaks of her understanding of the world and how it was "virgin" before the insider [gods](../gods/gods.md) brought everyone here ([The Arrival](../history/events/the-third-coming.md)). Ahsha is concerned with sealing off the chitine and any other more dangerous evil that could be lurking here, while Ephaine has ominous feelings about the counter-factual information this place is revealing to them about the world's history.

Ahsha backs whatever Ephaine wants to do, saying that their [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission can wait. Ephaine explains that her star chart suggests they should go back in, Ahsha confident they could prevail if they return into the room.

*[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> Hey, we're in this together, and I think we've got it. We've got a good team.

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> I just don't even know what this is.

The pair whisper about Noon's lack of sleep, glancing over at him while he reads a book, periodically flicking pages while wrapped up tightly in his blanket.

*[Everyone: long rest]*
