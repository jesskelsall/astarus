## Introduction

> Two nights ago a burning meteor streaked across the sky and smashed down to the earth. They say it came down near here, near [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), a village near the end of the [Northern Road](../places/roads/northern-road.md). Here travelers, traders, and immigrants stop as they make their way into the kingdom via the Hawksridge mountains beyond.
>
> Word of the meteor has spread and brought with it people looking for a rare and heavenly find, for the stories & excitement that it brings, and to profit from the rush.
>
> It is here, on the early evening two nights after the meteor streaked across the sky, that your paths will cross.

## Background

### Being [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md)

Magic is uncommon in this world, and so being [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) is incredibly useful. The kingdom’s military have been tasked with conscripting any magic users they find into their ranks.

The following classes are [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md): Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard.

For the sake of the story I’m crafting, I’d like all of your characters to be unaffiliated with the military. This means that if you’re [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), you need a reason for not having been conscripted already.

| d6 | [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) Background |
|:---:| --- |
| 1 | My magical abilities have only recently started awakening. |
| 2 | I have known that I am [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) from a young age but have no difficulty keeping it a secret. |
| 3 | I have known that I am [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) from a young age and struggle to control it. Keeping it a secret is a constant battle. |
| 4 | I refused to join the military willingly and was outcast. Nobody else knows I am [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md). |
| 5 | The military knows I am [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) and has been looking for me. They’ll never catch me. |
| 6 | I am not from the kingdom and am unaware that [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) are conscripted. |

### Race

A variety of races can be found in the kingdom, which is tolerant to most races.

However, elves and half-elves are heavily associated with the kingdom’s enemies. It would be normal for an elf or half-elf to be treated as a spy and refused service or access to basic things.

If you are set on playing an elven race, let’s talk about how you fit into the kingdom and how you choose to present yourself.

### Reason for Being Here

The meteor sighting has brought many people to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md). Are you here because of it, or is it merely coincidence?

| d10 | Reason |
|:---:| --- |
| 1 | I live in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) and have got caught up in the excitement the meteor has brought. |
| 2 | I frequently pass through [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) and am stopping for the night before I continue. |
| 3 | I’m seeking a new life in the kingdom and [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) is my first night here. |
| 4 | I’m a local that works around here doing any jobs I can find. |
| 5 | I came for the meteor. It will make me rich. |
| 6 | I came for the meteor. It is from the heavens and must be filled with divine power. |
| 7 | I came for the meteor. It is an evil omen and must be filled with dark power. |
| 8 | I came because of the excitement around the meteor. I want to see how this plays out. |
| 9 | I came because of the excitement around the meteor. I can profit from this somehow. |
| 10 | I came because of the excitement around the meteor. Everyone is distracted by it. |

## [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) Deva Dream 1

Several days before the story begins, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) is given a vision by her Deva. This is her reason for visiting [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) and seeking the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md).

Standing in a field south east of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) at night, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) can see the geographical surroundings of the town - forest to the east and west, mountains to the far north, and grassy plains in between.

She notices a meteor streaking across the sky, travelling down and left, leaving a white streak as it goes, continuing to accelerate.

It crashes down near the western forest, emitting a blast of white light so bright that for a moment it appears like day. After it subsides, flames can be seen rising from that area, the light from which creates silhouettes of the town in front of it.

Suddenly it begins to get foggy as smoke begins to encircle [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md). It grows thicker until she can see nothing, and as she breathes it in she loses consciousness, waking from the dream.
