## Session 0

### Groupings

Party split into 2 groups which will complete sessions 1A and 1B respectively.

| Group A | Group B |
| --- | --- |
| Becca<br>Sophie | Rin<br>Vika |

### Starting Levels

Both groups must agree on which group gets the starting level selections:

| Envelope Wording | Levels | Abilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mentor and Trainee | 4, 1 | Mentor gets paid when Trainee levels up. |
| Peers | 2, 2 | Once per combat encounter, peers can agree to swap places in initiative order. |

### Organisations

Each group picks an organisation from the options available. The only discernible difference when choosing is the wax seal on the envelope.

| Wax Seal | Wax Colour | Organisation | TCoE Patron | Bonuses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dragonfly | Mint | | Criminal Syndicate (p91) | |
| Fox | Gold | | Guild (p93) | Can choose [Vulpus](../lineages/vulpus.md) race. |
| Mechanical clock | White | {[Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md)} | Religious Order (p98) | |
| Paper crane | Purple | | Aristocrat (p89) | |

### Race

Players roll to determine which races they may pick from.

All hybrid races (italics) roll a second time to pick what their other race is. This includes standard races like Half-elf, as well as more exceptional races like Genasi and Shifter. Their other race can be a second hybrid race, but not the same one. Class features are mixed and matched to the player's liking and with the DM's help.
