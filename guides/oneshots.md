# Guide to Oneshots

## Introduction

This guide covers my process for arranging and running a oneshot for people via Discord. The method outlined has been used to great success with the [Raine's Artifact](../campaigns/O2-raines-artifact.md) oneshot.

## Finding Players

While there's no best way to find players, people who already use Discord are well suited to playing a game ran through the platform. In particular, D&D Discord servers are full of people who would love to play more D&D!

Finding players comes in waves - once there is interest from a few, it is best to ask around in search of the remaining players to form a party. This ensures that all interested players aren't waiting ages before plans begin to form, which can be detrimental to their level of interest and excitement.

## Confirming Interest

Once players have expressed an interest, direct message them to seek explicit confirmation. Posing a simple question gives them a solid reason to reply:

> Hey! 😊 Thanks for expressing an interest in my oneshot! 🎉 Could I get your timezone please? 😁

## Collecting the Party

Once enough would-be players have replied, it's time to get them assembled. In my Discord server I create a new text channel specifically for their oneshot, as well as a role that grants them access to it. With my specific setup I also want to make it clear that the usual server joining process doesn't apply to them and can be ignored.

> Welcome aboard to the oneshot party! 🎉  
> I'll be running it out of my Discord server, here's the link to join:  
> https://discord.gg/3sP7jb2n5Q
>
> Once I've seen you join I'll add you to the oneshot channel: \`#CHANNEL_NAME\` ✨
>
> Please ignore the \`#rules\` and \`#introduce-yourself\` channel - they're for people who want to join the server more generally, and isn't necessary for the oneshot (unless you want to of course!) 😅

The channel should already be set up, with an initial message to greet them. This should include all the details they need to understand what to expect and what is expected of them.

> Hello players, welcome to \*\*"ONESHOT_NAME"\*\*! 😊
>
> \_\_\*\*Summary\*\*\_\_
>
> \> ONESHOT_DESCRIPTION

>
> \*\*Please message here which character you'd like to play!\*\* Doing so calls "dibs" on that character.
>
> \- All are 5th level, fixed HP, [standard array](../mechanics/ability-score-method/standard-array.md) ability scores  
> \- Personality, background, combat style, and alignment are all recommendations - you're welcome to play them differently!  
> \- For caster classes that need to pick spells to learn on level up, please don't change the list of known spells.  
> \- For caster classes that need to prepare spells each morning, feel free to change which spells are prepared. Please note that the ones already prepared give an idea of what that character would typically prepare.

>Closer to the time I'll provide a link to the D&D campaign for the oneshot, where you'll be able to select your chosen character. 🎉

## Scheduling

### Date

Now that everyone's here, provide options for when the oneshot could take place. This should be done using an initial message followed by a message for each date. Doing so allows reactions to be added to each date message, giving players a means to indicate their availability.

> Now we need to decide when the oneshot will take place. Hopefully we can find a date and time that everyone can make! 😊  
> My next few messages will be dates that I am available. Please use the provided reactions to indicate if you can make that day :check: or definitely can't :cross~1: , or don't react to dates that you're not sure about 🙂
>
> I would expect the session to take up most of the day (at least 6 hours), so make sure your calendar is clear before indicating! Don't worry if that sounds like a lot for one sitting, we can break this into multiple sessions if need be! ✨

### Time

Once there is a consensus on the date that the oneshot will be played on, discuss times with the players. This will hinge on the players' time zones, so make sure to factor that in.

Typically I ask what the earliest time is that players are willing to begin, particularly if North America biased. From there a common start time can be found.

> Hey again folks! 👋😊 
>
> We've got a date that everyone can attend, so I'm going to lock that in place now:
\*\*DATE\*\* 🎉
>
> All we need to do now is decide what time to start! ✨
>
> As a reminder, this oneshot will take a minimum of 6 hours, so to facilitate a nice long session (if we're all up for it on the day), I'd like to know: \*\*what's the earliest everyone is happy starting that day?\*\*
>
> We've got TIMEZONE_BREAKDOWN.  
> I am very happy playing late for my time zone, so please don't factor my time zone into your answer! 😅
> 
> Here's a handy chart I'll be using to do conversions. 😅 

This should be accompanied with a time zone visual generated from this [meeting planner](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html). It provides a column for each time zone that players are located within, making for easier time conversion across time zones.

Once a time has been chosen, let everyone know what time the oneshot will start at, converted to each time zone, as well as expectations of punctuality.

> I'm locking us in for DATETIME_WITH_EACH_TIMEZONE 🎉
> 
> I'd ask you all to be on a touch early if possible, in case there's any technical issues 🙂 We won't be starting strictly on the hour though, it'll be a casual introduction and settling into the oneshot 😊

### Event

Create a Discord event for the oneshot, selecting the voice channel as the location of the event. The event should be the full name of the oneshot, as well as its number (which running of the oneshot this is). Provide a link in the oneshot channel, encouraging the players to confirm that the agreed time matches the event's time.

## Characters

As players have joined the Discord channel, they'll have looked at the list of pre-made player characters and hopefully indicated who they'd like to play. Once everyone has done this, send a message informing everyone of the final choices, locking that decision in place.

Now the campaign needs setting up in D&D Beyond so that everyone has a character sheet:

- Create a new campaign.
- Create copies of each "[ONESHOT]" character that players selected.
- Rename them in the "Character Name (Player First Name)" format.
- Use the campaign join link to join the campaign as each character.
- Unassign each character.

Provide the players a link to join the campaign, instructing them to select the character they've already chosen.

> It's time to grab your character sheets! 🤩  
> Here's the D&D Beyond campaign link:  
> https://ddb.ac/campaigns/join/26531733450176653
> 
> Please select the character you'd picked from the list of available characters 🙂  
> If you have a free D&D Beyond account and have already maxed out how many characters you can have, the options will be greyed out! 😮

## On the Day

Just to be safe, at the start of the day of the oneshot, remind everyone that it's today!

> Today's the day folks!! 🤩  
> https://media1.giphy.com/media/k04WlBzKhpd04/giphy.gif

Try and be online a comfortable 30 minutes early, with set up completed no later than 10 minutes before the session is due to start. This will provide time to meet and greet, as well as try to tackle pre-oneshot nerves.
