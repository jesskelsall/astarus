## Summary

Following a [Kavallos Fleet](../../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) raid on the town's coastal defences the night before, [Côtedouce](../../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md)'s remaining defences were overwhelmed the following day by warships, culminating in the town being raided and its loss to [Reimatelau](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md).

## History

### The Week Before

On the Kavallos Sea [the Mistral](../../places/ships/the-mistral.md) was intercepted by a [Kavallos Fleet](../../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) warship and boarded by Vorkazal the Razor and his most loyal soldiers. They took control of the ship, tying up [Captain Gill](../../characters/clef-gill.md) and his crew before making their way to [Côtedouce](../../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) as the supply ship had planned.

### The Day Before

[The Mistral](../../places/ships/the-mistral.md) arrives in port at [Côtedouce](../../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md). On its arrival [Captain Gill](../../characters/clef-gill.md) is coerced into calling for quarantine conditions for the ship, citing a virulent disease that was spreading amongst the crew. [Oriel Elsandoral](../../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) approves the quarantine measures, preventing any people or cargo from entering or exiting the ship for the time being. Extra [Unicorn Cavalry](../../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards are deployed to the dock to enforce the quarantine.

Under these measures the lack of crew visible on the top deck does not arouse suspicion. [Captain Gill](../../characters/clef-gill.md) is taken back below deck and is tied up again.

The ship's cache of gunpowder is all moved to the bow of the ship, sitting in the room that the crew are kept prisoner in. As the [Kavallos Fleet](../../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) infiltrator present magically rigs the powder kegs to explode on his command, Vorkazal the Razor warns the crew that if they try to leave the room, the kegs will explode automatically, killing them all. They believe this lie, choosing to stay put.

As night begins to descend, the [Kavallos Fleet](../../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers sneak down the stern of the ship unsighted, descending into the water and coming ashore further north. They make their way into hiding spots throughout the town, ready to strike the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md) when the time is right.

### The Night Before

*See: [MC04](../../sessions/MC04.md)*  
*See: [The Kavallos Fleet Attacks Côtedouce](../../storylines/the-kavallos-fleet-attacks-cotedouce.md)*

Seeing a commotion at the docks as the [Memories of Chausain](../../campaigns/C3-memories-of-chausain.md) party tries to infiltrate the ship, the plan is set into motion slightly early. The infiltrator detonates the cache of explosives, and the soldiers exit their hiding spots, charging towards the coastal defences.

Here they are met with little resistance, most of the guards running to the docks to investigate the destruction of [the Mistral](../../places/ships/the-mistral.md). [Keranios](../../characters/keranios.md) and the cannoneers are the only defence against the first wave of [Kavallos Fleet](../../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers, but soon more [Unicorn Cavalry](../../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards and the rest of the party show up.

As the infiltrator and Vorkazal the Razor himself arrive, many of the soldiers have already been dispatched, but they have managed to destroy two of the structure's four cannons. The infiltrator dies trying to destroy the other two while Vorkazal dies an honourable death in battle, surrounded by his enemies.

[Oriel Elsandoral](../../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) watches the events unfold from the [Tour de la Côte](../../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md), assisting as much as she can with her spells from extreme range. When the party returns to her she realises the goals of the attacks - to destroy the cannons. During their conversation she expends more magic to punish [Valan Shadowgaze](../../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) and to teleport the party to [Trest](../../places/settlements/towns/trest.md) following their new agreement.

### The Morning Of

As the sun rises, three [Kavallos Fleet](../../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) warships appear on the horizon. A cannon battle breaks out. [Oriel Elsandoral](../../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) tries to help as best as she can but most of her magic has been expended by the battle in the night, limiting her usefulness.

The warships take out the remaining two cannons, losing only one of their warships in the process. Now largely unchallenged, they bombard the town, destroying the buildings closest to the coast and severely damaging the [Tour de la Côte](../../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md) which tilts over slightly, refusing to collapse entirely.

As the fleet comes ashore on rowing boats, they outclass the combined [Unicorn Cavalry](../../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) and [Republic Guards](../../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md), many of which are injured or exhausted from the night's battle. They retreat, trying their best to evacuate the town to the north, seeking safety in the Reime Jungle. [Grouper](../../characters/grouper.md) is amongst those helping to evacuate north.

[Oriel Elsandoral](../../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) helps to coordinate evacuation efforts but is cut off by [Kavallos Fleet](../../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers. She holds them off while a group of civilians flees before having to retreat herself, heading east into the Kas'ran Desert. Her fate is unknown to the town's guards who live to tell the tale.

The [Kavallos Fleet](../../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) raid the town, killing anyone who remains, and looting any food and valuables they find. They raise their banner on the [Tour de la Côte](../../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md), a symbol of their strength. The town remains occupied by the fleet, a precious foothold on [Kardan](../../places/topography/continents-islands/kardan.md) from which they can strike other targets along the coast.
