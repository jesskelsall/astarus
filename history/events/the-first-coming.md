## Summary

[Kaldoon](../../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) created the first intelligent creatures on [Astarus](../../celestial-objects/astarus.md) in an event referred to by those races as The Beginning, and later by elves as The First Coming.

## History

[Kaldoon](../../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) sought to create his own planet with its own life, using [Astarus](../../celestial-objects/astarus.md) as his project. After creating plants, basic life, and eventually wildlife, he was ready to populate it with his new followers.

Using designs found elsewhere on other worlds, [Kaldoon](../../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) created dragons and giants, as well as [strigid](../../lineages/strigid.md), which were of his own design.
