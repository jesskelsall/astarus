# Naissance Calendar / DS

## Summary

The Naissance Calendar is the date system used by the elves of [the Second Coming](../events/the-second-coming.md) following their arrival on [Astarus](../../celestial-objects/astarus.md). It is in use by the [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) and the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md).

## Years

The epoch of the date system is the year of [the Second Coming](../events/the-second-coming.md).

All dates use the suffix **DS**, [elvish](../../languages/elvish.md) for "since salvation" (*depuis le salut*). Years before the epoch are represented as negative numbers.

Each year is 225 days long.

## Months

There are 8 calendar months, each of which is 28 days long, except for Premifleurs which has a 29th day.

## Days

Each week has 7 days.

Due to the even division of months by days of the week, each month starts on the first day of the week.

| 2 | Mardi | Tuesday |
| 3 | Mercredi | Wednesday |

### Réflexion

The 29th day of Premifleurs is known as Réflexion ([elvish](../../languages/elvish.md) for "reflection"), which is a holiday for remembering [Oonar](../../celestial-objects/oonar.md), steeped in traditions of [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md).

In order to facilitate the extra day, 29th Premifleurs uses Réflexion as the day of the week, separating it from the weeks either side of it.

## History

When the Elves of Chausain arrived on [Astarus](../../celestial-objects/astarus.md) during [the Second Coming](../events/the-second-coming.md), they soon realised that their calendar which worked for [Oonar](../../celestial-objects/oonar.md)'s seasons and lunar cycle didn't match [Astarus](../../celestial-objects/astarus.md)' own.

With each lunar cycle lasting 28 days and the year appearing to be 225 days long, an eight month calendar was established. Each month was named after a settlement, farmstead, or geographic nickname from within the Elves of Chausain territory, as tribute paid to places prominent elves once frequented.

As there was an extra day to spare, this was added to Premifleurs as the 29th day of the month, Premifleurs being the month that [the Second Coming](../events/the-second-coming.md) fell under.

Since [the Third Coming](../events/the-third-coming.md), all civilisations on [Kardan](../../places/topography/continents-islands/kardan.md) have adopted the Naissance Calendar except for the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) who use their own [Astorian Calendar](astorian-calendar.md).
