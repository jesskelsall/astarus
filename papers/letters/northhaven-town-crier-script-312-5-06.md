> The [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) have reached [sanctuary](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md). Two guards and the [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter [Vilnia Kovas](../../../astarus/people/vilnia-kovas.md) were killed as the group fought their way to the [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) stronghold. It is unclear what their intentions are. [Astornox commandant](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/ranks/7-commandant.md) [Itharmund Steeleye](../../../astarus/people/itharmund-steeleye.md) has demanded that the [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) release them immediately so they can be brought to justice.
>
> Protests in [Eskrigg](../../../astarus/places/cities/eskrigg.md). Locals fight for the rights of Firbolgs in the [Mocker Swamp](../../../astarus/places/forests/mocker-swamp.md). The [Eskrigg](../../../astarus/places/cities/eskrigg.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) took swift action to punish these troublemakers for disturbance of the peace and challenging the judgement of Captain [Legacy Aranius](../../../astarus/people/legacy-aranius.md).
>
> Construction of the Southern Temple has finished. [Yeatscale](../../../astarus/places/cities/yeatscale.md)'s temple to [The Order of the Diamond](../../../astarus/gods/the-order-of-the-diamond.md) was completed with an opening ceremony by General Supreme Corville Thornox himself. Glory to the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/README.md) and her ambitions in South [Kardan](../../../astarus/places/continents/kardan.md).
>
> New [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) graduates begin their service! 100 new [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have joined the organisation's ranks after the graduation ceremony led by [Astorrel Commandant](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/8-commandant.md) [Levelle Tristwix](../../../astarus/people/levelle-tristwix.md) and Captain [Mergin Thorgus](../../../astarus/people/mergin-thorgus.md). They will join the mission to preserve [Kirrel](../../../astarus/gods/gods/kirrel.md)'s blessings and keep the great [Kingdom of Astor](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/README.md)'s ambitions in balance with their will.
