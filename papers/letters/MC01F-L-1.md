> Dear VÄ“trall,
>
> I write to you today with both good and bad news.
>
> First it is with sadness that I inform you that [Vulpes Geen](../../characters/vulpes-geen.md) has passed away. He left this world from the comfort of his own bed, surrounded by his family.
>
> I'm told he was sad that you couldn't be there during his final moments. It's clear to everyone that he thought the world of you.
>
> We're having his funeral at the end of the month. I have no doubt you'll be there.
>
> Now for some good news!  
> The family want you to take a new member under your wing and train them in our ways.
>
> As part of this they'd like to give you a [Coin of Friendship](../../items/coin-of-friendship.md) so that you can recruit anyone you choose into the family.
>
> I know it's taken a while to earn everyone's trust, but you're now on your way. You have more friends here than I think even you realise!
>
> Looking forward to seeing you when you arrive.  
> I should be Father of the Door when you do.
>
> Your friend,  
> [Hanz Peacemaker](../../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md)
