| **Fame** |
| *I once endured a self-important noble ranting at length about how overblown [Lady Crane](../../../organisations/lady-crane.md) is. Once he learned who I am he soon changed his tune.* |
| Proximity to [Lady Crane](../../../organisations/lady-crane.md) herself carries weight with the nobility. When the higher class of the land learn that someone knows [Lady Crane](../../../organisations/lady-crane.md) personally, they take notice of them. |

| **Infamy** |
| *Typically we avoid conducting business with the lower class. They often resent what we have and hold it against us, against their better judgement.* |
| Commoners aren't keen on those who associate with [Lady Crane](../../../organisations/lady-crane.md). As the most prominent aristocrat in the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md), [Lady Crane](../../../organisations/lady-crane.md) is a symbol of the wealth gap present in most states. |
