| **Fame** |
| *There is a growing movement of so-called Returners gathering in [Arrepont](../../../places/cities/arrepont.md). They believe it is possible to return to [Oonar](../../../planes/oonar.md), and they are seeking our help.* |
| Returners see [The Time Enlightened](../../../organisations/the-time-enlightened.md) as their salvation. While followers of [Valnos](../../../gods/deities/valnos.md) revere [The Time Enlightened](../../../organisations/the-time-enlightened.md), it is Returners who stand to gain the most from their existence, as without their help they may never find a way back to [Oonar](../../../planes/oonar.md). |

| **Infamy** |
| *Our biggest obstacle is those who do not honour the truth. For these leaders we have no time or respect. The facts will speak for themselves.* |
| Leaders and religious fanatics see [The Time Enlightened](../../../organisations/the-time-enlightened.md) as a threat. When an organisation values truth and history above all else, those who seek to build their own narrative and control others feel threatened by their politics-free approach. |
