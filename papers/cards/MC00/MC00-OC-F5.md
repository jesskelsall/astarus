| **Home Settlement** |
| **[Trest](../../../places/towns/trest.md) ♢ Town** |
| *It's no wonder that [Familia Vulpes](../../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) formed here. The view of ships going up and down the gulf and a glimpse of [Arrepont](../../../places/cities/arrepont.md) on a clear day makes you yearn to explore the world.* |
| The second settlement along the [Nilus Coast](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/nilus-coast.md) after the capital city of [Starnov](../../../places/cities/starnov.md), [Trest](../../../places/towns/trest.md) is a busy trade town with a vibrant market. While it has an active harbour, most of its trade comes from over-land trade along the [Nilus Coast](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/nilus-coast.md) itself, supporting the settlements to the west. |

| **Home Bonus** |
| **Family First and Always** |
| *We take the “Familia” part of our name very seriously. Any one of us would help another in need. Anytime, anywhere. That's what family means.* |
| When returning to the Fox Hole in [Trest](../../../places/towns/trest.md), [Familia Vulpes](../../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members are able to gain the service of other organisation members who will aid them on their next adventure. |
| A clear goal or end point must be established before help is offered. |
