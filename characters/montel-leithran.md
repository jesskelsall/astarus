## History

Montel and [Vensys Leithran](vensys-leithran.md) fled the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) due to an escalating rivalry between their family and another. They managed to sneak into the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) via the Kas'ran Desert to Mossband, then on to Hyceodd, bypassing Blittergate.

Here in Hyceodd they attempted to settle down, finding enough other immigrants in the city to feel safer. During this time Vensys gave birth to [Esme Leithran](esme-leithran.md), who exhibited signs of being special, having greyer than normal skin.

When [Vensys Leithran](vensys-leithran.md) was murdered for being an elf, Montel and Esme (now 4 years old) fled, heading across the [River Carn](../places/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) and onto the Humar Estuary. Vensys doesn't have a clear plan of what he is doing or where they are going, but wishes to try and get away from [South East Kardan](../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md), possibly to [Kardanis](../places/regions/kardanis.md) or the [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md).
