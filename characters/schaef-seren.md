## History

During [Ephaine Seren](ephaine-seren.md)'s childhood, Schaef taught her stories of the stars and their importance, passing down knowledge and stories from his father, Oberon Seren.

The pair formed a close bond, Ephaine often joining Schaef as he herded the family's sheep. Their time alone brought them closer, Ephaine becoming a bit of a "daddy's girl".

### The Early Winter

When [Ephaine Seren](ephaine-seren.md) was 15, during a particularly tough winter in which the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) garrison were forced to overwinter due to the sudden arrival of the late autumn snow, [Tamman Seren](tamman-seren.md) stood up to an [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md) and his vanguard who came for his family's sheep in the night.

Tamman was severely beaten for his insolence. As penance, Schaef Seren was forced to herd the best of his remaining livestock back to the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) garrison. While doing this, an avalanche caused by [Ephaine Seren](ephaine-seren.md) buried the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) still present near his family home. He returned with the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) escort to his home.

By the time he arrived, Ephaine had fled, seeking the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) for [sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md).
