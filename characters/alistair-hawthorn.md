## Summary

Alistair Hawthorn is the [Astornox Captain](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-captain.md) of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md).

He comes from a prestigious family and is the embodiment of the upper class in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), ruling through rank and reputation alike.

## History

When he was younger, Alistair was stationed in Kilflynn with [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md). It was here that they became good friends.

### Pre-campaign

*See: [Finding the Goldreach Meteorite](../storylines/ended/finding-the-goldreach-meteorite.md)*

Following the impact of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), Alistair saw an influx of people into [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md). This put him on edge as more people typically means more trouble.

Not long after, his friend [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md) arrived in the town from [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) to investigate the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). He agreed to host him in his home while he had business in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md).
