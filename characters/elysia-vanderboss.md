## History

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md)

Elysia comes to see the party in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) to find out what has happened to [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md), having heard rumours in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) of his disappearance.

If it becomes clear that the party know Wrenn, she will delve deeper into what they know. At mention of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) or the creatures, she will urge the party to keep the information to themselves unless they wish to start a panic.

She may come back later to find out more info.

She sent [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md) to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to attempt to retrieve the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), following [Tyburn Dalvos](tyburn-dalvos.md)' prediction of its arrival.

| Meteorite | [Timeline](../history/timeline.md) | [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) Action | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Humar Estuary Meteorite | 6mo ago | Squad investigates while on mission. | Crater and small meteorite fragments found. |
| Silethwaite Meteorite | 4mo ago | [Alos Varkann](alos-varkann.md) investigated alone. | Evidence of strange creatures causing havoc and their den. |
| [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) Meteorite | 3mo ago | Not yet investigated. | |
| Carnmere Meteorite | 1mo ago | [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md) investigated alone. Secretly hired [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) to help him. Fled. | No evidence found. |
| [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) | 1wk ago | [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md) investigated alone. | [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party found creatures and the meteorite. Wrenn captured by [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md). |

6 months prior to the start of the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) campaign, [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) notices strange meteors crashing to the ground within the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). They take it upon themselves to investigate them outside of their regular [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission duties.

For the last 6 months, a meteor has fallen roughly once a month.

One member of [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) is a seer who has been able to predict when and where several of the meteors will land. This leads [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md) to set off for [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) 5 days before the meteor lands, arriving only 2 days after it does.

Wrenn intends to find the meteorite and return it to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) so that they may investigate its properties and nature, furthering their independent research.
