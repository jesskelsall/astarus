## Summary

Elysia Vanderboss is a no-nonsense, driven tiefling with high demands on her [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads. Her guarded and stern demeanour both protects herself from her superiors and allows her to encourage her squads to bend the rules in pursuit of her goals.

As the original investigator into [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), Elysia is at the heart of the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s efforts to learn more about the meteoric threat.
