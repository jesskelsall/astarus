## History

In her youth, Oriel Elsandoral was offered membership of [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md), gaining a [Coin of Friendship](../items/coins/coin-of-friendship.md). While she chose not to accept and instead pursue a political career in her home state of [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md), she kept the coin for sentimental reasons.

Later in life she moved to [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) where she became its arch-mage, becoming the town's ruler. Here she watches over its trade and delicate relations with the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) who have a delicate shared guard presence in the town.
