## History

TODO

```
Hey, my name is Wizira, or at least, that's what people know me by.
I'm a 107-year old firbolg living in the forest with my father, or so i did until he went missing, but more on that later.

My life started out in the clan of the cliffside, far to the north of these lands, but that changed when i was 10 years old when my mother was killed.
The clan blamed my father for her murder and exiled him from their lands without giving him any chance to explain what happened.
He took me and left without me having time to collect my things.
My father tells me he has nothing to do with my mothers murder but i don't know if this is true as i was not there when it happened, he also never wants to talk about what really did happen so the death of my mother is a mystery to me still to this day.

My father took me to the forest near [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) where we started a new life with just the two of us, the first few years were tough surviving on our own but after about 3 years things started getting more comfortable and my father started teaching me how to fend for myself out in the wild. He also taught me to avoid conflict as much as possible unless there are no other ways to get out of a situation. Unfortunately my fathers mental state started deteriorating soon after and when i turned 17 years old my father was unable to support us anymore which brought the weight of survival on my shoulders, being still 13 years away from mature age this put a lot of strain on me as i had to mature early which brought some problems with them. I distrust strangers and feel like everyone is always out to harm me, i stayed away from the town of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) for most of my life until one day i saw a halfling lady struggling in the forest near my home. My first reaction was to ignore it since my father taught me to leave others to their own trouble and not put myself at risk for the sake of others, but something about this half ling intrigued me.
On her shoulder she wore a badge in the shape of a grass snake with green, blue, and teal markings. The markings of the goddess [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md), the goddess our tribe used to worship and my father taught me about, my curiosity took the best of me and i went in to try and help this halfling. At first my large size scared her but i was able to reassure her that I just wanted to help her and ask her some questions about her badge. After some hesitation the halfling told me that she was the owner of a botany shop in the town of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) and got herself lost in the woods looking for herbs. i helped her return to the town and was about to return to the forest when she grabbed my by the arm and asked me to go to her shop with her. in my fear of attracting attention i tried to refuse her offer, but she insisted on properly thanking me for my help. i hesitantly agreed to her request and disguised myself as a regular human town's lady to try and not attract attention to myself. When we arrived at her shop i was intrigued by all the different plants she had growing around her shop but noticed how the plot of land behind her shop was mostly barren and the few plants that were there were either dead or dying. She asked me what my name was, but being that firbolg's don't use names and i never talked to a commoner before i never thought of this and didn't have one, she smiled and said to me that i looked like a Wizira, i liked this name and agreed to go by this name. She than handed me a pouch with some strange shiny objects in it, confused about what she handed me i asked her, and she explained to me that in the civilized world these objects were seen as a currency that you could exchange for goods and services. intrigued by this idea i wondered what sort of objects she was talking about, she took me around the town and market place and showed me a few shops and stalls. still new to this concept i asked her how many of these objects i would need for some of the things we saw in the market and i found out that i didn't have enough, so i asked her how i would be able to get more. this is when she told me about jobs and errands and offered to pay me if i helped her out with her plants in the yard behind her shop which was out of sight of any commoners, so i could safely work without having to worry about being seen by strangers.
I accepted her offer and started working for her, but since my father always taught me not to trust towns people i did not tell him about my new-found friend and job.
Everything went great after this for a few years, doing my botany job and a few other odd jobs around town, but this all changed when one day when a meteor flew trough the sky.
Not thinking much about it i went to town for my botany job, after a few hours i started noticing there was something going on somewhere in town, when i went to go check on the halfling in the shop she was no longer there, she left a note with the name on it she gave me with a pouch of coins, on the note she said that she went to the market and that the coins were my pay. I grabbed the pouch and left to go see what was going on for myself, but when i arrived in the town square it was full of people all shouting and waving at each other, i freaked out and ran for home, but when i got there i noticed that something was wrong. The door to our house was busted open, worried about my father i ran inside to look for him, but when i got there he was nowhere to be found, that is when i noticed all our books and tools were scattered all over the floor, it looked like there had been a struggle but there was no blood anywhere. I started to panic and started running around our home looking for any indication of my father, but to no avail. i returned to my home and had a panic attack and fainted because of it. when i came by it was already the next day i felt like i busted my head against something and had the strangest nightmare, but than when i regained most of my consciousness i noticed that it wasn't a nightmare at all, but it was all real. i struggled to get up but eventually got up, still feeling a bit drowsy i stumbled my way to town to talk to the halfling about what had happened, when i arrived in the town it was almost even more crowded than the day before, i quickly disguised myself and made my way to the botany shop, but to my unfortunate surprise it was really busy there too, i tried to talk to the halfling, but she said she was to busy and for me to wait till she was closing (meta 5PMish), while waiting for her to be done i went to look around town for a bit to try and find any traces of my father but to no avail, i returned to the botany shop and went to lay down in the backyard to regain a bit of energy since i was exhausted, then i suddenly got woken up by the halfling who smiled at me and asked me if i had a rough night, since i slept the whole day, i jumped up realizing how late it already got and that i slept almost the whole day, i almost panicked again and had a hard time explaining to the halfling what had happened, she told me to take it slow and tell her what was wrong, i finally was able to explain to her what had happened, and she was shocked, this is when she told me about what was going on in town and about the meteor (to-be-continued)
