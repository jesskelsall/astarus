## History

[Wizira's Father](wiziras-father.md) and mother raised their young daughter amongst their native [Hawkswood](../places/forests/hawkswood.md) firbolg clan.

At the age of 10, Wizira's mother was killed in unknown circumstances. The clan blamed her father for her murder, exiling him from the clan and their lands before he had a chance to explain what happened, forcing the pair to leave suddenly and without their belongings. In the following years her father would insist that he had nothing to do with her murder, but he was unwilling to explain further. The circumstances of her death remain shrouded in mystery.

The pair migrated south, setting up a new homestead, still within the [Hawkswood](../places/forests/hawkswood.md). After 3 years of struggling to survive they had a comfortable life with a cabin for them both to live in. [Wizira's Father](wiziras-father.md) started teaching her how to fend for herself in the wild, placing an emphasis on resorting to violence only when no other option was available.

By the age of 17, [Wizira's Father](wiziras-father.md)'s mental health had deteriorated to the point where Wizira was providing for the pair. His grief over the loss of his wife and their exile had weighed heavy on him despite their new life. Wizira was forced to mature early, causing her deep seated distrust of others and a feeling of imminent danger by default.

Their life continued in this way uneventfully until Wizira was over 100 years old. Despite their proximity to the town of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) she avoided civilisation entirely.

One day while wandering the woods Wizira found Heather Pentz struggling in the woods. Disregarding her father's teachings of leaving people to their own business she intervened, looming large over the halfling to see what is wrong. She sees a pin of a grass snake, recognising it as a symbol of [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md), the god that her firbolg tribe (as well as her and her father) worship.

Heather explained that she was lost in the woods. Wizira was able to help her back to the forest's edge. Heather grabbed Wizira's arm, insisting that she come and visit her botany shop ([Heather & Horticulture](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/heather-and-horticulture.md)) so she could thank Wizira properly for her help. Wizira tried to refuse the request but caved in when pressed. She used Disguise Self to appear as a similar woman so she could blend in. Terrified at the prospect of going into town, Wizira mustered up her courage.

Once at the shop, Wizira noticed a neglected and overgrown courtyard behind the shop while Heather was fetching some coin to compensate her. When Heather asks her name and Wizira tells her she doesn't have one, Heather names her Wizira. Heather then goes on to explain currency and takes her around [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to show her the things coin can buy. When it dawns on Wizira that she will need more coin to afford items she is browsing that she would like, Heather offers her a job working in her courtyard to cultivate plants for her shop, noting that the enclosed nature of the courtyard will keep her identity a secret.

Wizira kept her new job secret from her father, pretending that she was simply foraging in the forest when she returned to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to work for Heather.

### [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md)

On the night that the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) impacted north west of the town, Wizira returned into the shop to find Heather Pentz absent, but a note was left for her including her pay. The commotion caused by the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) started overtaking [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), forcing Wizira to return home out of panic.

When she returned to her house she found her father missing, with signs of a struggle evident in the house. She spent some time searching the vicinity for him but couldn't find him.

Eventually she wandered back into [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) where she wished to search for him, but the chaotic nature of the town in the ensuing fervour caused by the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) forced her back to Heather's courtyard where she remained to catch her breath and collect her thoughts, waiting for Heather Pentz's return.
