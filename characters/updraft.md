## Summary

Updraft is a grandiose and discerning warlock with an eye for fine wares. He is a perfectionist, seeking only the finest wares for [Lady Crane](../organisations/lady-crane.md). While he dreams of being a humble hero in a grand conflict, he willingly overlooks how her selfish and aristocratic tendencies have rubbed off on him.

Updraft speaks in the voices of nobles he has encountered, fashioned by his perfectionism into a smooth and natural speaking style that few other kenku are capable of.

## History

Growing up on the streets of a busy capital city, Updraft drifted through life until a chance encounter with [Lady Crane](../organisations/lady-crane.md). In exchange for his service as one of her hands, she would grant him the power of wind magic and eventually, flight, harnessing the power of a djinni she controls.

Now Updraft lives in opulence when at Crane Manor, or on the road, persuading nobles to part with whichever rare trinket [Lady Crane](../organisations/lady-crane.md) currently has her heart set on acquiring. He chooses to operate out of [Dünnesland](../places/towns/dunnesland.md), enjoying the vibrant beer town's character as well as its proximity to [Hochwald](../places/cities/hochwald.md).
