## History

Lucia Velpione was born in Ballabeg to Lucia's Mother and Lucia's Father, under a full moon. Born as a tiefling in a small community her father was accused of having fallen for a succubus, rumours he did not expressly deny. What little Lucia knows about her mother comes from what the villagers say, though they did not know her name. Her father would not speak of her.

By the age of fifteen Lucia had developed a way with words that allowed her to often get what she wanted. This eventually blew up in her face when she was caught trying to steal an amulet from the Ballabeg [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md). She was able to evade capture and fled to Port Soderick.

In the port town she sharpened her deceitful skills, stealing and swindling from a variety of people coming through the port, never using the same identity twice to evade capture. Often her tactics involved seducing men and stealing their possessions while they were asleep overnight.

Within the year she started feeling sick, eventually realising that she was pregnant. 9 months later she gave birth to her daughter. Feeling unable to take care of the unnamed child she left it on the steps of the [Temple of the Sailor](../places/buildings/temples/temple-of-the-sailor.md), watching from afar until a caretaker took her inside.

This moment made her reevaluate her way of life. She boarded a ship for [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md), a 17 year old girl ready to take on the rest of her life.

On the day of her arrival she noticed a man running away from the [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md). Coming across Lucia he dropped to his knees and begged for her help. She agreed, working enchantment magic without his knowledge or consent to compel him into believing her. She convinced him to hand himself over to the guards and that it would be safe for him to do so. To her surprise she was not thanked but accused of being [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) and taken into their custody as well.

Lucia was shipped off to Kilflynn where she was conscripted into the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). Before she could be processed to begin her training, the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) in [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md) paid a visit, noting her magical potential. They made a request to the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) to have her released into their custody, which they accepted. Lucia would instead be trained to be an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

After 2.5 years of training in [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md) with her [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mentor (and now 20), Lucia graduated in a ceremony in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), promoted to [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md). She was placed in a squad that called themselves [Pillar Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/pillar-squad.md), where she remained for 1.5 years. She was then selected to work under the Major of Phenomena, moving into [Aura Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/aura-squad.md) to help investigate whether ghosts exist. She excelled, earning herself a promotion to [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md), but turned it down, not wishing to be responsible for others.

On a later assignment [Aura Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/aura-squad.md) was attacked by bandits while investigating a cave. Lucia managed to talk her way out of the situation, escaping back to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). There she told her [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) that the rest of her squad had been ambushed & killed, and that she was lucky to have escaped. She was given a two weeks off to recover, with the expectation that she would be assigned to a new squad thereafter.

To her surprise the rest of [Aura Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/aura-squad.md) showed up in the middle of the second week, explaining the true version of events - that Lucia had abandoned them. This enraged her Squad Sergeant and their Lieutenant. Both sought to transfer her to another squad, realising that Lucia's relationship with them was not salvageable. As luck would have it, [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) had just suffered the loss of [Wizira](wizira.md), creating an opening for Lucia to drop into.
