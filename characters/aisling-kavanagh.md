## History

### Backstory

Aisling was born into a wealthy family, her father [Eoghan Kavanagh](eoghan-kavanagh.md) being an [Astornox Captain](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-captain.md). The Kavanagh family is well respected throughout the kingdom, and own a lucrative hot spring in the town of Eaglesfield where they live.

She was her father's favourite of his two twin children. Naturally gifted in fighting, she took a shining to martial arts from a young age and began honing her skills.

Due to her witnessing her father looking down on her brother [Diarmuid Kavanagh](diarmuid-kavanagh.md), she has vowed to out-shine her father, driving her and her brother to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) rather than the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). It is very important to her that she does it together with Diarmuid in order to prove to her father that he isn't as weak as he believes.
