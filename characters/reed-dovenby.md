## Summary

Reed Dovenby is a understated and motherly [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) that works in and around the [Great Sile Woods](../places/topography/forests/great-sile-woods.md). She enjoys hosting at [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) as she finds the role a relaxing way to talk to others.

She is happy and confident by herself due to her magic and experience as an [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md).
