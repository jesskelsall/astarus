## Summary

Ikra is the kobold scale sorcerer in charge of the blue kobold tribe living out of [Blue Kobold Cave](../places/caves/blue-kobold-cave.md). He is the wisest kobold of the tribe, helping direct complex efforts to ensure the tribe survives. Despite this, they are still jumpy and distrusting.

Ikra was given a [Blue Dragon Scale Necklace](../items/blue-dragon-scale-necklace.md) by their master [Cheorrosdyr](cheorrosdyr.md), who created the blue kobold tribe. This has acted as a de facto token of leadership.

## History

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/astorrel-agents.md)

Ikra will address [Ahsha Sallas](ahsha-sallas.md) and [Sharakas](sharakas.md) as they're brought into the depths of [Blue Kobold Cave](../places/caves/blue-kobold-cave.md).

He will take a dim view on word that they killed a pack of kobolds patrolling the [Walna Forest](../places/forests/walna-forest.md) the day before.

Ikra wants to ensure the safety of his tribe at all costs. They have been stealing from [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) to survive, and have been disrupting the logging camp and their logging efforts out of a base fear that if the villagers wander far enough into the forest, the kobolds will be found and wiped out.
