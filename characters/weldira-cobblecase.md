## History

*See: [Revenge of the Magicborn Hunters](../storylines/revenge-of-the-magicborn-hunters.md)*

Weldira has been growing increasingly frustrated with her role as a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter. Two years in, she has performed well and yet sees no sign of her citizenship being granted. Up until recently her frustration was directionless.

Following the death of [Vilnia Kovas](vilnia-kovas.md), [Kur Merkys](kur-merkys.md) spoke to Weldira about his plan to kill [Thanea Morlay](thanea-morlay.md) and [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md). Weldira likes the idea, suggesting that if his group is successful, they could all flee into the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) after.

Weldira works closely with [Bluefoot](bluefoot.md), who she is now trying to convince to join Kur's cause.
