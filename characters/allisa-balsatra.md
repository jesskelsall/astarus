## History

### Pre-Campaign

Allisa Balsatra was born into a common Syntenne family. At an early age her scourge [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) abilities manifested, causing her eyes and mouth to radiate divine energy and burning heat. This made people keep their distance from her.

Rumours of her quirks reached the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) government who took her in and placed her in a magical acceleration programme, educating her, including in how to control her magical abilities. All of this came naturally to her.

The government were keen for her to take up a public role, grooming her for a leadership position. She was declared a gift from [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md), a chosen child, though nobody really knew what she is. She instead decided to join the Veritacris so that she could see other civilisations, secretly wanting to locate someone else like her, as ordained by her deva. The government reluctantly agreed, feeling her personal freedoms took priority.

Allisa has spent time amongst the [Nil'savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md), [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md), and most recently the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). Recently she has heard rumours of a gifted [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) that spread radiant wings in the [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md) semi-final...
