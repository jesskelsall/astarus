## History

### Pre-Campaign

Allisa Balsatra was born into a common Syntenne family. At an early age her scourge [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) abilities manifested, causing her eyes and mouth to radiate divine energy and burning heat. This made people keep their distance from her.

Rumours of her quirks reached the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) government who took her in and placed her in a magical acceleration programme, educating her, including in how to control her magical abilities. All of this came naturally to her. The word "[aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md)" was coined to describe her divine gifts, and she was bestowed with the title [Aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) of the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).

During this training she went through several custodians, each trying to impart the wisdom of [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) upon her. Allisa quietly resented it, not finding any solace in the teachings of the Judge Mother. Then her next mentor, [Levron Udrexe](levron-udrexe.md) taught her of [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md), a god of [the Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md) not typically worshipped within the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). Allisa found parallels between her [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) situation and [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md)' qualities, turning her into a believer, and Levron her friend. Levron gifted her a [Citrine Eye Necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md), a magical focus supposedly imbued with divine power from [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) herself.

The government were keen for her to take up a public role, grooming her for a leadership position. She was declared a gift from [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md), a chosen child, though nobody really knew what she is.

As her powers grew, her deva [Minsas](minsas.md) begin giving her increasingly numerous dreams of far off lands and the peoples there. Additionally she had recurring dreams of [Augury Rock](../places/topography/landmarks/augury-rock.md), a seemingly banal landmark in the Kas'ran Desert. Eventually she made her way to it, standing on it and gaining the ability to talk directly to her deva whilst there. [Minsas](minsas.md) told her that she wasn't along in the world, and it was up to her to find the others.

Allisa defied the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), refusing to take up a political position befitting her abilities, instead demanding to join the Veritacris. The arch-mages reluctantly agreed, allowing her freedom to choose, and expecting that she would eventually take up the position once tired of being a spy. Allisa told others that she joined the Veritacris to see more of the world, hiding her true goal to find other [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) from everyone but [Minsas](minsas.md).

Allisa completed missions that took her to all of the civilisations on [Kardan](../places/topography/continents-islands/kardan.md). In order: [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md), [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md), [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md), [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md).

Pushed in the direction of [Eskrigg](../places/settlements/cities/eskrigg.md) by [Minsas](minsas.md), Allisa heard word of a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) with radiant wings that would be fighting in the [Nature's Battle 28](../storylines/ended/natures-battle-28.md) final...
