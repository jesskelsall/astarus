## Summary

Tamman Seren is [Ephaine Seren](ephaine-seren.md)'s older brother. He lives in the village of [Filisur](../places/settlements/villages/filisur.md) with his parents, [Schaef Seren](schaef-seren.md) & [Adalie Seren](adalie-seren.md), and his younger siblings.

## History

When [Ephaine Seren](ephaine-seren.md) was 15, during a particularly tough winter in which the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) garrison were forced to overwinter due to the sudden arrival of the late autumn snow, he stood up to an [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md) and his vanguard who came for his family's sheep in the night.

He was severely beaten for his insolence before Ephaine healed him with her druidic magic. This act caught the attention of the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) present. Ephaine then buried and killed them in an avalanche of her causing.

After this, Tamman watched on as his sister quickly departed to seek the [sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) of the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md). He hasn't seen her since.
