## History

Arsha served in the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) during the [Astor-Syntenne War](../history/events/astor-syntenne-war.md). He was in active service when the armistice was signed. When the Major of War began downsizing their branch of the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md), he gladly took the citizenship and voluntary retirement offered to him.

Following this he moved to [Mockerkin](../places/settlements/towns/mockerkin.md), at that time a growing town, looking for work. He became a mason, working to construct the sorely needed houses. Through this work he met his future wife and mother of his daughter, [Felina Sallas](felina-sallas.md). Within two years she would give birth to [Ahsha Sallas](ahsha-sallas.md).

When Felina expressed an interest in joining the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md), Arsha was supportive, raising Ahsha and working full time for 2 years before she returned from the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) training programme, unsuccessful. As a result she joined Arsha as a mason, now a family business.

To this day Arsha is a hard working mason and homeowner, afforded to him by his military pay and citizenship.
