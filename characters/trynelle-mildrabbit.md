## Summary

Trynelle Mildrabbit is an ambitious and straightforward halfling with ambitions of going far in the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md). Her draconic bloodline's manifestation as a large birthmark of black scales and the subsequent acid damage has disfigured her face, but she is determined not to let this hold her back.
