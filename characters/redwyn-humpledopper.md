## Backstory

Redwyn Humpledopper was born in the town of Carnmere. They have a brother.

Their parents owned a tavern in Carnmere. Their family had a feud with the Waterstride family (halflings) who own The Rusty Spigot, a competing tavern.

One day Redwyn returned from foraging to find their family's tavern ransacked and their parents slain. There was no sign or trace of her brother. Due to the feud and these events, Redwyn has a distaste and distrust of halflings.

With little tying them to Carnmere anymore, Redwyn ventured out to attempt to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) so that she could explore unseen lands and hopefully find a new purpose protecting her corner of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) from those who would do it harm.

- They don't believe in any of the four [gods](../gods/gods.md) and will pledge themselves to one of them in bad faith. [truth]
- The only reason they joined the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) was for an opportunity at vengeance. [lie]
