## History

During [Ephaine Seren](ephaine-seren.md)'s childhood Adalie Seren was forced to aid the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) at Fort Maloja on various errands, typically helping them with the lay of the land and keeping watch out over the Neum Flats. This built within her a bitter resentment of the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) and by extension the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), who she sees as occupiers in [Cepine](../lineages/cepine.md) territory.

Her early relationship with Ephaine was one of pragmatism and tough love. She taught Ephaine her survival skills, helping her understand the valley and its changeable seasonal conditions. She expected a lot from her daughter, knowing that the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) presence would likely only grow throughout their lives.

### The Early Winter

When [Ephaine Seren](ephaine-seren.md) was 15, during a particularly tough winter in which the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) garrison were forced to overwinter due to the sudden arrival of the late autumn snow, [Tamman Seren](tamman-seren.md) stood up to an [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md) and his vanguard who came for his family's sheep in the night.

Tamman was severely beaten for his insolence. During this developing situation, [Ephaine Seren](ephaine-seren.md) caused an avalanche that buried and killed the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) still present outside their home.

In the following aftermath, Adalie helped quickly prepare provisions for Ephaine as she fled home, seeking the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) for [sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md).
