## History

### Backstory

Born into the family of a city captain, Darius' mother's fire elemental lineage caused problems when their child was born with red skin. Shunned by his parents, Darius spent his youth reading books and wishing for a fairer world with less war and conflict. After discovering his magical powers at the age of 15, he entered into the [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) recruitment programme to escape his home life, graduating after only two years.

- Their parents are high ranking [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). [truth]
- They are a pacifist. [truth]
- They were abandoned by their parents. [lie]

### [Astorrel Graduation](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/storylines/astorrel-graduation.md)

The [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/astorrel-agents.md) party found Darius following the [Astorrel graduation](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/storylines/astorrel-graduation.md) presentation due to the yellow marking of [Valnos](../gods/gods/valnos.md) on his forehead. He stood mostly silently with the party until [Grant Thackeray](grant-thackeray.md) and [Levelle Tristwix](levelle-tristwix.md) came over to chat.

The party has seen Darius in [Bryce Morton's Office](../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md) when he was placed in [Ruby Squad](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby.md).
