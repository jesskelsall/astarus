## History

Born into the family of a city captain, Darius' fire genasi lineage caused problems when their child was born with red skin. Shunned by his parents, Darius spent his youth reading books and wishing for a fairer world with less war and conflict. After discovering his magical powers at the age of 15, he entered into the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) recruitment programme to escape his home life, graduating after only two years.
