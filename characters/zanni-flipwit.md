### Trouble in [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md)

Zanni's house was attacked last week by the kobolds while she was inside. She is able to tell the party the following information:

- Middle of the night, windy night.
- The roof was set on fire.
- Something tried to bash the door open but gave up.
- Heard unintelligible talking, arguing.
- Short, blue, scaly.
- Found a skunk in her house the following morning.
