## History

### [AA02](../sessions/AA02.md)

The party encountered Roygol in [Allonby](../places/villages/allonby.md) while on their way to [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md). Both [Redwyn Humpledopper](redwyn-humpledopper.md) and [Ahsha Sallas](ahsha-sallas.md) spoke to him separately in the village courtyard. Ahsha told him of the bandits that had ambushed them between [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) and [Humouth](../places/villages/humouth.md). He explained that due to the low [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) presence along the [Coastal Trail](../places/roads/coastal-trail.md), bandits have an occasional presence here.

He also told Ahsha that the guards don't go as far as [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) as the locals there refuse their help, so they don't make the 2 day round trip as it is a waste of their time.

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../campaigns/astorrel-agents.md)

Roygol Mortisen will either be in [Allonby](../places/villages/allonby.md) or [Humouth](../places/villages/humouth.md) with his 2 new [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md), depending on how long the party is in [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md).
