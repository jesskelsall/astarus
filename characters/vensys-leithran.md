## Summary

Vensys Leithran was the mother of [Esme Leithran](esme-leithran.md). She was killed by [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) while living in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) with her daughter and husband, [Montel Leithran](montel-leithran.md).

## History

Vensys and [Montel Leithran](montel-leithran.md) fled the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) due to an escalating rivalry between their family and another. They managed to sneak into the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) via the Kas'ran Desert to Mossband, then on to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), bypassing [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md).

Here in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) they attempted to settle down, finding enough other immigrants in the city to feel safer. During this time she gave birth to [Esme Leithran](esme-leithran.md), who exhibited signs of being special, having greyer than normal skin.

When Esme was 4 years old, [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md), led in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) by [Jonwen Cryss](jonwen-cryss.md), murdered her simply because she was an elven immigrant.
