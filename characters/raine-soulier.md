## Summary

Raine Soulier is a reclusive and kind hearted elf that descends from Rene Soulier. He is an expert on [memory spheres](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) and possesses some [echneshment](../mechanics/magic/echneshment.md) magical knowledge.

Raine possesses [Mémoire de Chalet](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-chalet.md). He spends a worryingly large amount of time within it as an escape from the real world, wishing for the life his ancestor once had.
