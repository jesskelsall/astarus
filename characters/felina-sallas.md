## History

Felina Sallas is originally from [Mockerkin](../places/towns/mockerkin.md). During her youth she spent much time in [Winster Forest](../places/forests/winster-forest.md) and on the bank of the [River Esk](../places/rivers-lakes/river-esk.md), while watching the settlement steadily grow into a town.

Meeting [Arsha Sallas](arsha-sallas.md) at the age of 15, the pair were married and had a child, [Ahsha Sallas](ahsha-sallas.md), only two years later. Following this Arsha encouraged her to follow her dream to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md). Miraculously her affinity with nature made her a promising candidate, and she soon joined the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) training programme in [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md).

By her second year of training it was becoming clear to her mentors that she wasn't quite [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) material. She was cut loose from the programme, returning to [Mockerkin](../places/towns/mockerkin.md). The experience broke her heart, causing her great shame. Eventually she resigned herself to working alongside Arsha as a mason.

Despite their steady family business, Felina was constantly reminded at her lack of citizenship. As Ahsha grew of age, it became apparent to her that her mother and father were treated differently.
