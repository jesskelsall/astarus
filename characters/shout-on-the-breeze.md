## Summary

Shout on the Breeze is the father of [Whisper on the Breeze](whisper-on-the-breeze.md). He was the leader of Clan on the Breeze prior to abandoning them to join the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

## History

Once Clan on the Breeze emigrated from the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) to the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), the clan spent some time in the under construction city of [Yeatscale](../places/cities/yeatscale.md). It was here that Shout joined the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and abandoned his clan. As a result of this, the clan skipped town, heading further north along the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md).
