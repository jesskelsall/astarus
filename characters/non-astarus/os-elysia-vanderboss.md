## Summary

Elysia is a charismatic leader figure, shrewd and cunning. She knows how to impress her stern demeanour on people to get them to collaborate and conquer any obstacle. She has no time for humour but is full of sarcasm and put-downs when unimpressed by people who fail to live up to her standards. Not one for following rules, Elysia follows her own vision and puts all of her faith and trust in those who follow it too.

Rising the military ranks from a young age, Elysia worked her way into a leadership position investigating natural phenomena such as dangerous creatures and strange magic. She has been able to excel by building her own squads who answer only to her. As long as her superiors saw her getting work done, a blind eye was turned. With her squads off handling business for her, she is able to pursue her own adventuring interests on the side.

In combat Elysia knows her way around a crossbow, preferring to engage her enemies from a distance and seek the perfect opportunity for a surprise attack. She is quick to move out of harm's way, making her very slippery and annoying to fight.
