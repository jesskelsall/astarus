## Summary

Zolné is a confident and quiet barbarian that prefers actions over words. She is wary of strangers, choosing to wrap her head and cover her tail to give the impression that she is a tabaxi, wary of the attention that being a rare leonin may bring. Given a goal she charges straight ahead, only keeping her eye for potential danger to be met head-on.

A nomad from a pride of desert leonin, Zolné proudly represents the Windclaw name, speaking highly of them to those who get to know her lineage. She wanders the lands looking for a worthy challenge, eager to put her abilities to the test.

In combat Zolné wields a glaive with dexterity and precision rarely seen. She revels in combat, diving into the middle of danger. There she calls upon the spirit of her ancestors who wielded her glaive before her, helping keeping her enemies focused on her alone.
