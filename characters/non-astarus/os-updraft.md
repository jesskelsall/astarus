## Summary

Updraft is a grandiose and discerning warlock with an eye for fine wares. He is a perfectionist, seeking only the finest wares for his wealthy patron, Lady Crane. While he dreams of being a humble hero in a grand conflict, he willingly overlooks how her selfish and aristocratic tendencies have rubbed off on him. Updraft speaks in the voices of nobles he has encountered, fashioned by his perfectionism in a smooth and natural speaking style that few other kenku are capable of.

Growing up on the streets of a busy capital city, Updraft drifted through life until a chance encounter with the lady who would become her patron. In exchange for his service as one of her hands, she would grant him the power of wind magic and eventually, flight, harnessing the power of a djinni she controls. Now Updraft lives in opulence when at Crane Manor, or on the road, persuading nobles to part with whichever rare trinket his Lady currently has her heart set on acquiring.

Preferring to fight from a rooftop or elevated position, Updraft uses his wind magic to disrupt his enemies' movements, allowing others to get their hands dirty on his behalf. At the sign of danger he repositions, vanishing in the blink of an eye or moving at rapid speed, finding a new spot to harass his foe from.
