# Aisling Kavanagh

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/9f82606a878e8670.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/9f82606a878e8670.png" height="400" />

| **Name** | Aisling Kavanagh |
| **Lineage** | Human |
| **Pronouns** | she/her |
| **Age** | 22 |
| **Class** | Monk (Way of the Sun Soul) |
| **Alignment** | Lawful Neutral |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59129624) |

Aisling is a stern and focused monk that likes to get the job done quickly. She is very confident in her martial prowess, using that as a sign of her superiority over others. Hard to impress and quick to retort judgmentally, Aisling is not one for making friends. It is hard to earn her trust, and harder to earn her respect.

Raised with her brother Diarmuid Kavanagh, the pair left home after mistreatment by their father. Diarmuid is an accomplished wizard who relied heavily on his sister's protection until he came of age. That instinct to protect still runs deep.

In combat Aisling surprises her foes by channelling her ki energy into searing bolts of light, picking them off with ranged attacks. She uses her speed and confidence to keep her enemies guessing.

# Allisa Balsatra

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/acae3c3cdd6dddcb.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/acae3c3cdd6dddcb.png" height="400" />

| **Name** | Allisa Balsatra |
| **Lineage** | Scourge Aasimar |
| **Pronouns** | she/her |
| **Age** | 129 |
| **Class** | Cleric (Light Domain) |
| **Alignment** | Neutral Good |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59132721) |

Allisa is a quiet and mysterious cleric, wary of revealing too much of herself to the wrong people. Her aasimar lineage is a closely guarded secret, only revealed when absolutely necessary. She is polite, considerate of others, and quick to offer help, but hiding behind her helmet gives her an unfortunate cold and untrustworthy exterior. A necessary downside to protect herself.

Raised in an elven civilisation, Allisa knew she was special from a young age. The word "aasimar" was invented just for her, the first of her kind to exist. Society elevated her through special magical training and political education, but she opted instead to wander the continent in search of someone else like her.

Fighting in heavy armour, Allisa is a tank that wields a shield and deadly magic. She is able to react quickly and effortlessly using her radiant magic bestowed upon her by Valnos, the jewelled hawk god of knowledge and light. When the going gets tough, she rips off her helmet to reveal her burning golden skin, scorching all nearby in her radiant glow.

# Bluefoot

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/c13024bd9a3e931c.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/c13024bd9a3e931c.png" height="400" />

| **Name** | Bluefoot |
| **Lineage** | Firbolg |
| **Pronouns** | he/him |
| **Age** | 217 |
| **Class** | Druid (Circle of the Land: Forest) |
| **Alignment** | True Neutral |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59133486) |

Bluefoot is a plain and disconnected firbolg with little left to lose. He is uncaring and cold, rarely interested in other people or the frivolities of society. His mind often wanders, drawing him to signs of nature, the last place he feels any peace. With a broken spirit and a weak sense of self-preservation, Bluefoot is easily coaxed into dangerous errands, not held back by fear or morals.

Once a proud member of the blue firbolg clan, Bluefoot was exiled for challenging the clan's leader on the exploitation of their forest. Feeling he had no other choice, he integrated into the nearby society, learning its ways and customs. Eventually he was offered a role in a military organisation that captures magic users to conscript them into the army. The anguish he was forced to place others under eventually broke his soul, causing him to move on a second time.

Bluefoot's inherent magic as a firbolg serves him well in combat, allowing him to vanish momentarily to escape harm. When he is hit, his hardy exterior allows him to take a beating. He has became well versed in skills that allow him to capture his foes, using the earth around him to manifest vines and thorns. Failing that, his trusty whip never lets him down.

# Elysia Vanderboss

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/81d3db8d3e3009cd.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/81d3db8d3e3009cd.png" height="400" />

| **Name** | Elysia Vanderboss |
| **Lineage** | Tiefling |
| **Pronouns** | she/her |
| **Age** | 37 |
| **Class** | Rogue (Scout) |
| **Alignment** | Chaotic Neutral |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59133797) |

Elysia is a charismatic leader figure, shrewd and cunning. She knows how to impress her stern demeanour on people to get them to collaborate and conquer any obstacle. She has no time for humour but is full of sarcasm and put-downs when unimpressed by people who fail to live up to her standards. Not one for following rules, Elysia follows her own vision and puts all of her faith and trust in those who follow it too.

Rising the military ranks from a young age, Elysia worked her way into a leadership position investigating natural phenomena such as dangerous creatures and strange magic. She has been able to excel by building her own squads who answer only to her. As long as her superiors saw her getting work done, a blind eye was turned. With her squads off handling business for her, she is able to pursue her own adventuring interests on the side.

In combat Elysia knows her way around a crossbow, preferring to engage her enemies from a distance and seek the perfect opportunity for a surprise attack. She is quick to move out of harm's way, making her very slippery and annoying to fight.

# Kur Merkys

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/b2aa89a6831d0359.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/b2aa89a6831d0359.png" height="400" />

| **Name** | Kur Merkys |
| **Lineage** | Tiefling |
| **Pronouns** | he/him |
| **Age** | 22 |
| **Class** | Sorcerer (Draconic Bloodline) |
| **Alignment** | Lawful Evil |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59134333) |

Kur is a hot-headed schemer that revels in any opportunity to show how special he is. Quick to anger and willing to hold a grudge until he can enact his vengeance, Kur is not one to cross. He rarely speaks and when he does his anger at having to readily shows. Despite his personality he is laser focused when given a goal and incredibly dependable.

Born on the streets of a capital city, Kur was impoverished and looked down on for his entire childhood. Eventually his magical powers began to manifest, turning his curse as a dragon-blooded tiefling into a huge blessing. Now capable, he began to pick off his childhood bullies one by one, seeing to it that they regretted their actions before meeting their untimely ends.

There are few finer wielders of lightning magic than Kur, and he knows it. He is quick to resort to his most powerful spells, blasting his foes before they have a chance to counter his abilities. Once he decides who is on the receiving end of his anger, he doesn't relent.

# Morgan Caithness

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/e7a36c7e28f97107.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/e7a36c7e28f97107.png" height="400" />

| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Morgan Caithness |
| **Lineage** | Human |
| **Pronouns** | she/her |
| **Age** | 29 |
| **Class** | Fighter (Battle Master) |
| **Alignment** | Neutral Good |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59160835) |

Morgan is a calm and jovial fighter that enjoys making friends and fighting alongside them when the going gets tough. She is quick to strike up a conversation but rarely talks about matters of consequence, preferring to talk about the simpler pleasures in life. Morgan wakes up every day with an appreciation for new experiences to come.

Raised in a sleepy fishing village, Morgan set out into the world knowing that there was much more to see and do. She has travelled between settlements in search of friends and adventure since she could hold a weapon. Now experienced in the ways of combat, her skills and friendship are sought by those who know her reputation.

In combat Morgan's technique is rather simple - keep hitting her foes with her greataxe until they go down. What often surprises them is how masterfully she wields such a heavy weapon, hitting them in situations where others would be struggling to position themselves. This gives her more opportunities to inflict heavy wounds with her steel.

# Ophelia Phantom

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/55c516b3fc870b24.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/55c516b3fc870b24.png" height="400" />

| **Name** | Ophelia Phantom |
| **Lineage** | Human |
| **Pronouns** | she/her |
| **Age** | 25 |
| **Class** | Cleric (Twilight Domain) |
| **Alignment** | Neutral Evil |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59161160) |

Ophelia is a snarky and confident cleric with a superiority complex. She considers herself a pleasure to be around, effortlessly charismatic and a person of great importance. When her view of herself isn't shared by someone she meets, she is quick to dismiss them as unable to perceive her brilliance. When she is humbled by the world she easily cracks, presenting her with an existential crisis.

Born to wealthy social elites, Ophelia was raised in an environment that called her special and gifted. Watching the sunset each night from her family manor awakened something within her as Malnesh the Judge Mother imparted her magic upon Ophelia. Now she takes her gifts into the world to help others, in the process showing them how incredible she is.

In combat Ophelia's mastery of dark conditions makes her a formidable opponent in night raids. She is able to pinpoint enemies with magical clarity, allowing her party to land more of their hits. When the going gets rough she calls upon the light of the moon to scorch her foes.

# Penance Zahiri

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/1c019d0a10e8341a.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/1c019d0a10e8341a.png" height="400" />

| **Name** | Penance Zahiri |
| **Lineage** | Tiefling |
| **Pronouns** | they/them |
| **Age** | 23 |
| **Class** | Paladin (Oath of Redemption) |
| **Alignment** | Chaotic Good |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59161695) |

Penance is a joyous and inquisitive paladin who enjoys stories and gossip. They revel in the drama of life and its excitement, even in grave situations, for a dull or repetitive life is the enemy. They wear their heart on their sleeve, making their feelings clear without reservation. Typically those feelings are excitement, willingness, and laughter.

Starting out as a small time criminal in a major city, Penance spent their early teens helping move magic users out of the city where the military were likely to conscript them into the army. They claim that one night Bhygar the Storyteller appeared to them, a vision of two men holding a storybook. From then on they took the name "Penance" and resolved to live a more honourable and exciting life.

In combat Penance preys on the strong willed, drawing them into single combat with them. With a sword and shield they are able to both take and deal blows while working some limited divine magic to punish those for daring to fight in the first place.

# Sparrow on the Autumn Pine

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/41e0b0962f18eb6b.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/41e0b0962f18eb6b.png" height="400" />

| **Name** | Sparrow on the Autumn Pine |
| **Lineage** | Tabaxi |
| **Pronouns** | he/him |
| **Age** | 30 |
| **Class** | Ranger (Swarmkeeper) |
| **Alignment** | Chaotic Good |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59161941) |

Sparrow is a kind and generous soul with a knack for getting into trouble. He is well mannered and speaks plainly, often missing social context or misreading sarcasm, answering all questions with a plain honestly that confuses the socially adept. Sparrow is quick to offer help to those who need it, but has a habit of over-promising and under-delivering.

One of twelve tabaxi children, Sparrow wasn't anything special growing up in a small village. After moving to the capital city as a teen he longed for a connection with nature. On long walks in the nearby forest he became acquainted to the wasp hives that lived there, entering into a symbiotic relationship with them, allowing him to care for other creatures while surrounded by the brick and mortar of the city.

In combat Sparrow is the worst nightmare of someone afraid of insects. While his shortbow may appear to be his main danger, the wasp hive grown on his torso allows him to manipulate his environment and enemies by shooting wasps out of the sleeves of his robes. Beyond that he has developed skills which make him well suited to traversing and hiding in the city streets.

## Updraft

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/a4214a21ac247b88.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/a4214a21ac247b88.png" height="400" />

| **Lineage** | Kenku |
| **Pronouns** | he/him |
| **Age** | 41 |
| **Class** | Warlock (The Genie) |
| **Alignment** | True Neutral |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/63570277) |

Updraft is a grandiose and discerning warlock with an eye for fine wares. He is a perfectionist, seeking only the finest wares for his wealthy patron, Lady Crane. While he dreams of being a humble hero in a grand conflict, he willingly overlooks how her selfish and aristocratic tendencies have rubbed off on him. Updraft speaks in the voices of nobles he has encountered, fashioned by his perfectionism in a smooth and natural speaking style that few other kenku are capable of.

Growing up on the streets of a busy capital city, Updraft drifted through life until a chance encounter with the lady who would become her patron. In exchange for his service as one of her hands, she would grant him the power of wind magic and eventually, flight, harnessing the power of a djinni she controls. Now Updraft lives in opulence when at Crane Manor, or on the road, persuading nobles to part with whichever rare trinket his Lady currently has her heart set on acquiring.

Preferring to fight from a rooftop or elevated position, Updraft uses his wind magic to disrupt his enemies' movements, allowing others to get their hands dirty on his behalf. At the sign of danger he repositions, vanishing in the blink of an eye or moving at rapid speed, finding a new spot to harass his foe from.

## Vilnia Kovas

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/50e8e14dbe105dba.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/50e8e14dbe105dba.png" height="400" />

| --- | --- |
| **Lineage** | Human |
| **Pronouns** | she/her |
| **Age** | 33 |
| **Class** | Wizard (School of Enchantment) |
| **Alignment** | Chaotic Evil |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59162161) |

Vilnia is a calm and ominous wizard that knows how to manipulate others through magical means. She is able to put sympathy to one side in the pursuit of her own goals, allowing her to cause suffering to people with an ease that most would have for kindness. Lacking a strong code, she leans heavily on context and her intuition to decide on a course of action.

Discovering her magic at a young age, Vilnia was trained by some of the finest wizards in the kingdom, at great expense endured by her parents. Eventually she was attracted to a role in hunting magical people for conscription into the military, one that would put her magical prowess to the test and see her achieving wealth and an early retirement if she succeeded.

In combat Vilnia shuts down her enemies with magic that controls their thoughts, compelling them to put down their arms and surrender. Taking a hit or bloodying her trench coat is a mark of failure for her.

## Zarrus Maleron

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/1ae2de2399ee701b.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/1ae2de2399ee701b.png" height="400" />

|||
| --- | --- |
| **Lineage** | Tiefling |
| **Pronouns** | he/they |
| **Age** | 23 |
| **Class** | Druid (Circle of the Stars) |
| **Alignment** | Neutral Good |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59162827) |

Zarrus is a gracious and humble tiefling that lives to help and serve others. He is exceptionally well mannered, using his intuition and experience as an innkeeper to identify and meet the needs of others. Those who have met him talk highly of his hospitality and attention to detail, though he knows first hand that putting on such an outward appearance requires a level of worry and anxiety unsustainable to most.

Born of politically active parents, Zarrus didn't care for his father's expectations of him and the social training he was forced into. He spent many a night staring up at the stars, finding a force amongst them that spoke to him, imparting a knowledge he didn't know he was seeking. Leaving home to strike out into the world on his own, he followed the star's guidance, eventually settling down and starting his own fancy inn where his odd appearance and charisma would be the main draw.

Zarrus isn't well suited to combat, finding the notion of fighting barbaric and scary. When pushed to his limits he is able to merge with the energy of the stars, transforming him into a confident and capable magic user that wields the power of constellations to vanquish his foes.

# Zolné Windclaw

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/portraits/4f524e26b1945fb0.png" height="400" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesskelsall/astarus-images/main/characters/hero-cards/4f524e26b1945fb0.png" height="400" />

| **Name** | Zolné Windclaw | character.3
| **Lineage** | Leonin |
| **Pronouns** | she/her |
| **Age** | 41 |
| **Class** | Barbarian (Path of the Ancestral Guardian) |
| **Alignment** | Lawful Neutral |
| **Character Sheet** | [Click here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/59162983) |

Zolné is a confident and quiet barbarian that prefers actions over words. She is wary of strangers, choosing to wrap her head and cover her tail to give the impression that she is a tabaxi, wary of the attention that being a rare leonin may bring. Given a goal she charges straight ahead, only keeping her eye for potential danger to be met head-on.

A nomad from a pride of desert leonin, Zolné proudly represents the Windclaw name, speaking highly of them to those who get to know her lineage. She wanders the lands looking for a worthy challenge, eager to put her abilities to the test.

In combat Zolné wields a glaive with dexterity and precision rarely seen. She revels in combat, diving into the middle of danger. There she calls upon the spirit of her ancestors who wielded her glaive before her, helping keeping her enemies focused on her alone.
