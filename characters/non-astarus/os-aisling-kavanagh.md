## Summary

Aisling is a stern and focused monk that likes to get the job done quickly. She is very confident in her martial prowess, using that as a sign of her superiority over others. Hard to impress and quick to retort judgmentally, Aisling is not one for making friends. It is hard to earn her trust, and harder to earn her respect.

Raised with her brother Diarmuid Kavanagh, the pair left home after mistreatment by their father. Diarmuid is an accomplished wizard who relied heavily on his sister's protection until he came of age. That instinct to protect still runs deep.

In combat Aisling surprises her foes by channelling her ki energy into searing bolts of light, picking them off with ranged attacks. She uses her speed and confidence to keep her enemies guessing.
