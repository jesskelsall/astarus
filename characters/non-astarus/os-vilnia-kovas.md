## Summary

Vilnia is a calm and ominous wizard that knows how to manipulate others through magical means. She is able to put sympathy to one side in the pursuit of her own goals, allowing her to cause suffering to people with an ease that most would have for kindness. Lacking a strong code, she leans heavily on context and her intuition to decide on a course of action.

Discovering her magic at a young age, Vilnia was trained by some of the finest wizards in the kingdom, at great expense endured by her parents. Eventually she was attracted to a role in hunting magical people for conscription into the military, one that would put her magical prowess to the test and see her achieving wealth and an early retirement if she succeeded.

In combat Vilnia shuts down her enemies with magic that controls their thoughts, compelling them to put down their arms and surrender. Taking a hit or bloodying her trench coat is a mark of failure for her.
