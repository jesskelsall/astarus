## Summary

Allisa is a quiet and mysterious cleric, wary of revealing too much of herself to the wrong people. Her aasimar lineage is a closely guarded secret, only revealed when absolutely necessary. She is polite, considerate of others, and quick to offer help, but hiding behind her helmet gives her an unfortunate cold and untrustworthy exterior. A necessary downside to protect herself.

Raised in an elven civilisation, Allisa knew she was special from a young age. The word "aasimar" was invented just for her, the first of her kind to exist. Society elevated her through special magical training and political education, but she opted instead to wander the continent in search of someone else like her.

Fighting in heavy armour, Allisa is a tank that wields a shield and deadly magic. She is able to react quickly and effortlessly using her radiant magic bestowed upon her by Valnos, the jewelled hawk god of knowledge and light. When the going gets tough, she rips off her helmet to reveal her burning golden skin, scorching all nearby in her radiant glow.
