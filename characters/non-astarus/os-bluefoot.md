## Summary

Bluefoot is a plain and disconnected firbolg with little left to lose. He is uncaring and cold, rarely interested in other people or the frivolities of society. His mind often wanders, drawing him to signs of nature, the last place he feels any peace. With a broken spirit and a weak sense of self-preservation, Bluefoot is easily coaxed into dangerous errands, not held back by fear or morals.

Once a proud member of the blue firbolg clan, Bluefoot was exiled for challenging the clan's leader on the exploitation of their forest. Feeling he had no other choice, he integrated into the nearby society, learning its ways and customs. Eventually he was offered a role in a military organisation that captures magic users to conscript them into the army. The anguish he was forced to place others under eventually broke his soul, causing him to move on a second time.

Bluefoot's inherent magic as a firbolg serves him well in combat, allowing him to vanish momentarily to escape harm. When he is hit, his hardy exterior allows him to take a beating. He has became well versed in skills that allow him to capture his foes, using the earth around him to manifest vines and thorns. Failing that, his trusty whip never lets him down.
