## Summary

Ophelia is a snarky and confident cleric with a superiority complex. She considers herself a pleasure to be around, effortlessly charismatic and a person of great importance. When her view of herself isn't shared by someone she meets, she is quick to dismiss them as unable to perceive her brilliance. When she is humbled by the world she easily cracks, presenting her with an existential crisis.

Born to wealthy social elites, Ophelia was raised in an environment that called her special and gifted. Watching the sunset each night from her family manor awakened something within her as Malnesh the Judge Mother imparted her magic upon Ophelia. Now she takes her gifts into the world to help others, in the process showing them how incredible she is.

In combat Ophelia's mastery of dark conditions makes her a formidable opponent in night raids. She is able to pinpoint enemies with magical clarity, allowing her party to land more of their hits. When the going gets rough she calls upon the light of the moon to scorch her foes.
