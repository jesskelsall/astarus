## Summary

Sparrow is a kind and generous soul with a knack for getting into trouble. He is well mannered and speaks plainly, often missing social context or misreading sarcasm, answering all questions with a plain honestly that confuses the socially adept. Sparrow is quick to offer help to those who need it, but has a habit of over-promising and under-delivering.

One of twelve tabaxi children, Sparrow wasn't anything special growing up in a small village. After moving to the capital city as a teen he longed for a connection with nature. On long walks in the nearby forest he became acquainted to the wasp hives that lived there, entering into a symbiotic relationship with them, allowing him to care for other creatures while surrounded by the brick and mortar of the city.

In combat Sparrow is the worst nightmare of someone afraid of insects. While his shortbow may appear to be his main danger, the wasp hive grown on his torso allows him to manipulate his environment and enemies by shooting wasps out of the sleeves of his robes. Beyond that he has developed skills which make him well suited to traversing and hiding in the city streets.
