## Summary

Kur is a hot-headed schemer that revels in any opportunity to show how special he is. Quick to anger and willing to hold a grudge until he can enact his vengeance, Kur is not one to cross. He rarely speaks and when he does his anger at having to readily shows. Despite his personality he is laser focused when given a goal and incredibly dependable.

Born on the streets of a capital city, Kur was impoverished and looked down on for his entire childhood. Eventually his magical powers began to manifest, turning his curse as a dragon-blooded tiefling into a huge blessing. Now capable, he began to pick off his childhood bullies one by one, seeing to it that they regretted their actions before meeting their untimely ends.

There are few finer wielders of lightning magic than Kur, and he knows it. He is quick to resort to his most powerful spells, blasting his foes before they have a chance to counter his abilities. Once he decides who is on the receiving end of his anger, he doesn't relent.
