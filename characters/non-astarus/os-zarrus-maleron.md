## Summary

Zarrus is a gracious and humble tiefling that lives to help and serve others. He is exceptionally well mannered, using his intuition and experience as an innkeeper to identify and meet the needs of others. Those who have met him talk highly of his hospitality and attention to detail, though he knows first hand that putting on such an outward appearance requires a level of worry and anxiety unsustainable to most.

Born of politically active parents, Zarrus didn't care for his father's expectations of him and the social training he was forced into. He spent many a night staring up at the stars, finding a force amongst them that spoke to him, imparting a knowledge he didn't know he was seeking. Leaving home to strike out into the world on his own, he followed the star's guidance, eventually settling down and starting his own fancy inn where his odd appearance and charisma would be the main draw.

Zarrus isn't well suited to combat, finding the notion of fighting barbaric and scary. When pushed to his limits he is able to merge with the energy of the stars, transforming him into a confident and capable magic user that wields the power of constellations to vanquish his foes.
