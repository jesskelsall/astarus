## Summary

Penance is a joyous and inquisitive paladin who enjoys stories and gossip. They revel in the drama of life and its excitement, even in grave situations, for a dull or repetitive life is the enemy. They wear their heart on their sleeve, making their feelings clear without reservation. Typically those feelings are excitement, willingness, and laughter.

Starting out as a small time criminal in a major city, Penance spent their early teens helping move magic users out of the city where the military were likely to conscript them into the army. They claim that one night Bhygar the Storyteller appeared to them, a vision of two men holding a storybook. From then on they took the name "Penance" and resolved to live a more honourable and exciting life.

In combat Penance preys on the strong willed, drawing them into single combat with them. With a sword and shield they are able to both take and deal blows while working some limited divine magic to punish those for daring to fight in the first place.
