## Summary

Morgan is a calm and jovial fighter that enjoys making friends and fighting alongside them when the going gets tough. She is quick to strike up a conversation but rarely talks about matters of consequence, preferring to talk about the simpler pleasures in life. Morgan wakes up every day with an appreciation for new experiences to come.

Raised in a sleepy fishing village, Morgan set out into the world knowing that there was much more to see and do. She has travelled between settlements in search of friends and adventure since she could hold a weapon. Now experienced in the ways of combat, her skills and friendship are sought by those who know her reputation.

In combat Morgan's technique is rather simple - keep hitting her foes with her greataxe until they go down. What often surprises them is how masterfully she wields such a heavy weapon, hitting them in situations where others would be struggling to position themselves. This gives her more opportunities to inflict heavy wounds with her steel.
