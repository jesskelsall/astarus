### Self Imposed Limitations

- Zarrus is easily scared. I will be making Wisdom saving throws to determined how scared he is, setting my own DC. If he is scared he will act frightened of the source, hindering his capabilities appropriately. If he is scared enough his Starry Form will activate as soon as possible.
- Zarrus cannot willingly engage his Starry Form, at least initially.
- Zarrus is unable to cast levelled spells unless his Starry Form is active.
- When in Starry Form, Zarrus' fear melts away, leaving him confident of his abilities. When this form ends he struggles to recall what happened or how he was able to access his powers.

## History

Zarrus Maleron is originally from the city of Kovac on the continent of Alunkai. Born to Emilia Maleron (mother, human) and Zolash Maleron (father, tiefling), and with an older sister, Reverence Maleron (tiefling, 26).

Due to his father's position as a prominent politician, Zarrus was afforded an affluent upbringing. He lived in comfort in the family home within the city, receiving private tutorship which included etiquette, reading & writing common & elvish, and weapon sparring. In his spare time he would read books about far off lands and stargaze, eventually forming an inexplicable magical connection to the stars above. Through this he is able to command minor magical effects at will.

At the age of 20 Zarrus began to feel the weight of expectation and responsibility on his shoulders as his father began preparing him for a public life of politics. When he spoke out about wanting to do something else with his life and feeling that the local politics cared not for the people of the city, Zolash had Zarrus study harder, seeing his son as a failure that needed correcting.

Very quickly Zarrus saw no other option than to leave home. Sneaking out one night with scant supplies and his diary which contains his notes about the stars alongside his personal musings, he followed the guiding lights of the stars by night and slept by day. Eventually the stars pointed him across the seas, so he travelled by ship northwest to Vennon, arriving in Crestshore.

Initially he found success as a barkeep in The Jade Axe in Ren, working for the owner, Nenith Jadehide, a middle aged dwarf. Nenith took the risk on the unproven tiefling, not minding Zarrus' eccentricities. Soon he came to rely on his attention to detail, sharp eye for customers' needs, and politeness. Zarrus enjoyed the work, fuelled by the smiles and laughter of their patrons. He had found his true calling.

Zarrus spent 2 years toiling away at his job, saving as much money as he could, rarely leaving the inn. During this time his reputation as "the blue tiefling" began to grow, bringing people to the inn who wished to experience his uniqueness and strangeness, both as a tiefling and as a person - his manners and mannerisms proved popular.

When Zarrus shared with Nenith his plan to buy his own inn so he could prove himself as a successful business owner, Nenith and his wife Giridrid were supportive and encouraging. Showing their true colours as his only real friends in this world, they gifted him a sizeable amount of gold. Combined with his own there was now enough to buy an inn and get thing set up. He wasted no time, buying an inn in Fort Dresdan and naming it Valley Under the Stars.

One year later, the inn is thriving, enjoying steady customers. Zarrus has been able to set the inn up as a premium destination, attentively catering to his guests' accommodation and culinary needs. He has recently hired a cook, Perace Teamouse (he/him, halfling), who is now preparing all of Zarrus' signature dishes and allowing him to focus his attention on other parts of the inn.

Zarrus prides himself on how far he has come. His persona as "the blue tiefling" has made him a small time local celebrity, drawing enough people to his corner of the Eastern Brace to sustain his business. He is exceptionally proud of what he has achieved. Each victory proves to himself that he can make it in the world without his parents. He still looks to the stars on clear nights for familiarity and guidance.

### Introduction

- The party will get to stay at Valley Under the Stars, showcasing the inn and Zarrus' hospitality. Food and accommodation is comfortable quality.
- A fire will engulf the building, destroying it. There is no one at fault - shit just sometimes happens. Perace Teamouse will be killed in the fire.
- Zarrus will set out to return to The Jade Axe to get his old job back, defeated by the loss of his inn.

## Places

### Pelannor (Planet)

Ian's homebrew campaign setting. The mages in The Anether are aware of its place in its solar system and its connection to other realms.

### Alunkai (Continent)

Zarrus' home continent and the location of Kobac. It sits northwest of Vennon and is close to the equator. As a result it is mostly covered in desert, though its coastlines support port cities. Its real world counterpart is Australia.

It is under the control of the Viceroy Gral state.

### Kobac (City)

Kobac is the capital city of the Viceroy Gral state, located on Alunkai's northeastern coast. Surrounded by desert to the south and west, Kobac is built onto the coastal hillside. Its closely packed white buildings and open markets are reminiscent of real life Santorini.

On the southern hills of the city are aqueducts above the main strip, known as The Drag.

Kobac's population is predominantly native, though its position as a trade city brings people and coin in from Vennon. This is the major contributing factor to Kobac's wealth.

| Race | Rarity |
| --- | --- |
| Human | 30% |
| Drow (Dark Elf) | 30% |
| Tiefling | 25% |
| Orc / Half-orc | 15% |

#### The Anether

On the south edge of the city is a distinctive white domed building called The Anether. The roof has a slit cut into it which rotates on occasion. It can often be seen either projecting light into the sky or displaying a large lens shaped spyglass not unlike a telescope.

It is home to a group of mages commissioned by the Viceroy Gral state to achieve the following goals:

1. Conduct meteorological experiments to ensure the city's constant supply of water.
2. Research the solar system that Pelannor is part of, and the connected known realms.
3. Serve as a lighthouse for ships navigating the dangerous reefs surrounding the city.

### Vennon (Continent)

Vennon is the continent that the Fog of War campaign takes place on.

### Crestshore (City)

Crestshore is a port city on Vennon. It was the first settlement visited by the Fog of War party, the Reeves Roamers.

Travel by boat from Kobac to Crestshore is around 15 days on the sea bearing northeast.

### Fort Dresdan (City)

The city that Zarrus calls home at his introduction to the campaign, and home to Valley Under the Stars.

It is split into five districts:

| District | Description |
| --- | --- |
| The Eastern Brace | South eastern branch extending outwards.<br>Residential, low to middle class.<br>One of two magical ballista called "Aether's Revolt" placed here. |
| The Western Brace | South western branch extending outwards.<br>Residential, upper class, working in the Candles and the Rib.<br>One of two magical ballista called "Aether's Revenge" placed here. |
| The Candles | Home to the Magical Council of Rais and school for the magically gifted.<br>Invite only, heavily guarded and watched over.<br>Five towers with spired roofs of different colours. Landmarks. |
| The Rib | Central, River Dresdan runs south through it, down waterfall between braces.<br>Commercial district, seat of politics.<br>Central feature: tree that grows from centre of ribcage of a complete dragon skeleton, thousands of years ago. Surrounded by greenery. |
| The Salem | Religious hub. Temples to various light-themed deities. |

### Ren (Settlement)

A settlement on the northeastern side of Vennon. It is a largely inhospitable place, ran by the various Ysun Guilds, including The Tahoramet and The Red Dawn.

It is accessed in the following ways:

- Through Caer Dunas to Caer Palas under the mountain.
- Through Ravenwood Crossing, then east through the Great Reach, a gap in the Silvertip Mountains.
