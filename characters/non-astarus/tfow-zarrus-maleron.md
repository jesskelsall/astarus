### Self Imposed Limitations

- Zarrus is easily scared. I will be making Wisdom saving throws to determined how scared he is, setting my own DC. If he is scared he will act frightened of the source, hindering his capabilities appropriately. If he is scared enough his Starry Form will activate as soon as possible.
- Zarrus cannot willingly engage his Starry Form, at least initially.
- Zarrus is unable to cast levelled spells unless his Starry Form is active.
- When in Starry Form, Zarrus' fear melts away, leaving him confident of his abilities. When this form ends he struggles to recall what happened or how he was able to access his powers.

## History

Zarrus Maleron is originally from [affluent city] on [tiefling continent]. Born to Emilia Maleron (mother, human) and Zolash Maleron (father, tiefling), and with an older sister, Reverence Maleron (tiefling, 26).

Due to his father's position as a prominent politician, Zarrus was afforded an affluent upbringing. He lived in comfort in the family home within the city, receiving private tutorship which included etiquette, reading & writing common & elvish, and weapon sparring. In his spare time he would read books about far off lands and stargaze, eventually forming an inexplicable magical connection to the stars above. Through this he is able to command minor magical effects at will.

At the age of 20 Zarrus began to feel the weight of expectation and responsibility on his shoulders as his father began preparing him for a public life of politics. When he spoke out about wanting to do something else with his life and feeling that the local politics cared not for the people of the city, Zolash had Zarrus study harder, seeing his son as a failure that needed correcting.

Very quickly Zarrus saw no other option than to leave home. Sneaking out one night with scant supplies and his diary which contains his notes about the stars alongside his personal musings, he followed the guiding lights of the stars by night and slept by day. Eventually the stars pointed him across the seas, so he travelled [direction] to [current continent].

Initially he found success as a barkeep in The Jade Axe in [town/city not yet visited], working for the owner, Nenith Jadehide, a middle aged dwarf. Nenith took the risk on the unproven tiefling, not minding Zarrus' eccentricities. Soon he came to rely on his attention to detail, sharp eye for customers' needs, and politeness. Zarrus enjoyed the work, fuelled by the smiles and laughter of their patrons. He had found his true calling.

Zarrus spent 2 years toiling away at his job, saving as much money as he could, rarely leaving the inn. During this time his reputation as "the blue tiefling" began to grow, bringing people to the inn who wished to experience his uniqueness and strangeness, both as a tiefling and as a person - his manners and mannerisms proved popular.

When Zarrus shared with Nenith his plan to buy his own inn so he could prove himself as a successful business owner, Nenith and his wife Giridrid were supportive and encouraging. Showing their true colours as his only real friends in this world, they gifted him a sizeable amount of gold. Combined with his own there was now enough to buy an inn and get thing set up. He wasted no time, buying an inn in [town] and naming it Valley Under the Stars.

One year later, the inn is thriving, enjoying steady customers. Zarrus has been able to set the inn up as a premium destination, attentively catering to his guests' accommodation and culinary needs. He has recently hired a cook, Perace Teamouse (he/him, halfling), who is now preparing all of Zarrus' signature dishes and allowing him to focus his attention on other parts of the inn.

Zarrus prides himself on how far he has come. His persona as "the blue tiefling" has made him a small time local celebrity, drawing enough people to [town] to sustain his business. He is exceptionally proud of what he has achieved. Each victory proves to himself that he can make it in the world without his parents. He still looks to the stars on clear nights for familiarity and guidance.

### Introduction
