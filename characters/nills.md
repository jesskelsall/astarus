## Summary

Nills is an aspect of [Nilliski](nilliski.md), passed between members of the [Schiller family](../organisations/schiller-family.md) for generations. She is currently part of [Noon Schiller](noon-schiller.md).

As an aspect of [Nilliski](nilliski.md), Nills enacts their will through the [Schiller family](../organisations/schiller-family.md). As part of Noon, Nills provides guidance, pushing Noon into actions that benefit [Nilliski](nilliski.md)'s unknown agenda. Nills exhibits an understanding of the future, or at least an exceptional understanding of causality, suggesting actions that only appear rational in hindsight.

Nills chooses who she is seen by, typically only appearing to [Noon Schiller](noon-schiller.md) when suggesting a course of action, though she has the ability to let others see her.

## Characteristics

Nills is Noon's shadow come to life. She appears as dark as a shadow, with white piercing eyes and mouth. On closer inspection she is part smoke, part eldritch tentacles - not a corporeal form in the normal sense.

## Interactions

### Intent

Nills wants to manipulate [Noon Schiller](noon-schiller.md) into doing her bidding. She provides guidance in many forms, situationally dependent. She may outright order Noon to do something, or merely hint at something to affect his course of actions. Ultimately Nills expects Noon to comply.

She does not make her goals clear to anyone. With Noon's obedience typically a given, she can expect her will to be carried out without question. When requiring the help of others or facing resistance from Noon, she makes her requests appear reasonable or enticing.

### Physicality

Nills has the ability to control who sees her, down to the individual. Typically she remains invisible to everyone, choosing to present herself to [Noon Schiller](noon-schiller.md) at opportune moments. Unless she wills it, nobody else can see her during these moments.

Her presence is based around manipulation of the mind rather than the material world. Attempting to occupy the same space as Nills or view her with Truesight would reveal no evidence of her existence.

### Personality

Nills is disinterested in others, except for the purpose of manipulation to her own ends. She acts flippant and aloof, disguising the seriousness of her goals.

When appeased, Nills is accommodating and kind, jovial to a point. When her needs aren't being met she is impatient and mean, pointing out peoples' shortcomings and making them feel bad about not helping her.

## History

When [Noon Schiller](noon-schiller.md)'s mother was still pregnant with him, the [Schiller Family](../organisations/schiller-family.md) held a secret ceremony to pass Nills to him, infusing the unborn child with the essence of [Nilliski](nilliski.md). For the entirety of Noon's life, Nills would be part of him.

Throughout Noon's life Nills has been there for him, similar to a sister or close friend. Nills often tries to push Noon into a certain course of action for reasons unknown to Noon. Noon usually goes along with Nills' whims, trusting her implicitly and often feeling like her will is directly his own.

Nills was responsible for getting Noon to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), to fight with [Dust of Chalk](dust-of-chalk.md), and to volunteer to be transferred to [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md).
