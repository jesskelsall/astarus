## History

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md)

Carras will visit the party in [sanctuary](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) along with [Norsha Costello](norsha-costello.md), who will insist on accompanying them. Carras is clearly embarrassed by Norsha who is vocally critical of Carras' failure to keep tabs on [Astral Squad](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/astral.md) to the point where [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md) went off on their own and is subsequently missing.

Carras will ask the party what they know of the circumstances of Wrenn's disappearance so that they may begin to atone for their transgressions.
