## History

Jonwen Cryss grew up on his parents' farm north of [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). Here the family cultivated potatoes and parsnips for sale in the [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) market, a meagre existence but an honest living with lots of hard labour required.

Around the age of 16, Jonwen's father was murdered by an elven immigrant from the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). He had broken into the family home in search of food in the winter months, and when Jonwen's father defended his family, the elf took him out with a dagger. The elf got away, never to be seen again.

Jonwen left home to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) in search of work for the family. He got wrapped up in a criminal life soon thereafter, falling in with [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) who were sympathetic to his story, wanting to empower him to right the wrongs of this world. Jonwen began climbing the organisation's ladder, eventually being placed in charge of operations in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). In the mean time he helped manage other farmers' affairs, getting their produce to market in prominent places for sale and trade, doing his best to push out competition from immigrants.

Jonwen has been responsible for hits carried out on immigrants in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), in particular elves coming up from the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), a grudge he has not left go of. He ordered the murder of [Vensys Leithran](vensys-leithran.md).
