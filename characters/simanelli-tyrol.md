## History

Over 300 years ago, Captain Tyrol gained a reputation as a capable ship captain, discovering [Kardanis](../places/regions/kardanis.md) and helping the fledgling [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) create its first maps of [South East Kardan](../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md)'s coastlines.

He was keen to explore what lay across the [Sea of Songs](../places/seas-oceans/sea-of-songs.md), so he gathered up the best crew he could find and set sail to the east. He and his crew were never seen or heard from again.
