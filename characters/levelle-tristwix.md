## Summary

Levelle Tristwix is the [Astorrel Commandant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md) in charge of the organisation's day-to-day operations.

She is a politically savvy commandant who is a big believer in the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Despite her slow and posh manner of speaking, she easily commands a room. She'd like to see less conflict with the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).
