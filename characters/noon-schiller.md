### Prior to Introduction

During [Dolphin Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/dolphin-squad.md)'s first mission (Survey Fish in [Picdale Water](../places/rivers-lakes/picdale-water.md)), Noon antagonised [Dust of Chalk](dust-of-chalk.md) over their metalworking rivalries: Noon is part of the [Schiller Family](../organisations/schiller-family.md) who operate out of Baldrine and extract high quality metal from mines at Ballabeg, while [Dust of Chalk](dust-of-chalk.md) is from Mossband, a small mining village. The quality of the [Schiller Family](../organisations/schiller-family.md)'s metal has made trade difficult for the Mossband villagers, making their lives harder.

[Dust of Chalk](dust-of-chalk.md) took this personally, and Noon inflamed tensions by making occasional cryptic snide remarks. Eventually Dust had enough and lashed out at Noon. Noon played the victim and spun the events to his favour.

[Panafiz Zemblelimble](panafiz-zemblelimble.md)'s mission report succumbed to Noon's tactics, reflecting poorly on Dust. In the wake of this, [Emdar Silverstrike](emdar-silverstrike.md) suggested to [Samantha Ilis](samantha-ilis.md) that one of the pair needed transferring to another squad. Noon volunteered, claiming it would be best to keep the rest of the squad together, but secretly being manipulated by [Nilliski](nilliski.md).

[Samantha Ilis](samantha-ilis.md) conferred with her squad sergeants. [Bryce Morton](bryce-morton.md) agreed to trade [Whisper on the Breeze](whisper-on-the-breeze.md) for Noon Schiller, Samantha feeling that there would be benefits to keeping two tabaxi together.
