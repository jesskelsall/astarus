## Summary

Gaspard Hostaneth is a courteous and knowledgeable [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) with a flair for his glaive and a desire to prove to the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) that elves can be trusted.

As one of only three elves serving in the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) military (all half-elves), Gaspard is scrutinised heavily and bears the burden of representing an entire race of people, a role he takes seriously and wishes to excel at. This drives him to be the best [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) he can be.
