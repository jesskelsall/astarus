## History

Reozin is an immigrant from the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md). At a young age he was taken in by a pit fighting trainer who brought him to [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) and began fashioning him into a capable fighter. This mentor saw great potential in him due to his minotaur lineage, not common even in the alliance. Reozin became an accomplished fighter, surprising those he fought with a mastery of two handed weapons rather than relying on his horns. He was scouted by the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) and joined their ranks looking for further fame and recognition.
