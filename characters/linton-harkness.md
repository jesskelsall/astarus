## History

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md)

Linton Harkness visits the squad in [sanctuary](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) to apologise on behalf of [Goshawk Squad](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md), taking it upon herself to do so. She hopes that [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) and the rest of the squad treated them well and weren't a hindrance.

Her view is that [magicborn on the run](../../campaigns/purple-rain/storylines/magicborn-on-the-run.md) should be left alone so that they can seek [sanctuary](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) alone. She is worried about her and her squads' reputations due to their involvement.
