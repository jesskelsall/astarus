## History

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md)

Garrick meets the party as they attempt to seek [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) with the help of [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md).

He accepts their request for [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), briefly explaining the terms of [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) to the party before moving them into [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md).

Following this he is posted outside of their quarters in the [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), unable to leave his post unless he rescinds the offer of [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). He checks on the party while bringing them their two daily meals. He also offers to help them within reason if they use the bells to contact him.

Garrick largely allows everyone to visit him, but refuses access to [Goshawk Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) due to their closeness to the events leading up to [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).
