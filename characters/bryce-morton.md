## Summary

Bryce is a career [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), looking for promotion. Despite this his methods are very hands-off, preferring to let his squads get on with their missions alone, and getting irritated when his assistance is called upon. His preference would be to stay inside of the [Northhaven Astorrel stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

He is a straightforward person with a military personality. He stands to attention and talks straightforwardly. In his quarters he can also be stern or pensive.
