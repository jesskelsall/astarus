## History

Mindira Flibfae is a big supporter of leaving firbolgs alone in their forest clans and is very vocal to this end. She has been trying for some time to convince [Levelle Tristwix](levelle-tristwix.md) to take the issue to the [Astornar](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornar.md) so that the [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) can formally oppose the actions of the [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md)

Mindira meets the party in [sanctuary](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) along with [Levelle Tristwix](levelle-tristwix.md) on their second visit. She is brought to them to gather evidence and begin formulating a strategy for how to approach the trial. She is keen to talk to [Wizira](wizira.md) and any other useful party members about experiences that illustrate the firbolg plight and the severity of the [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

Mindira mentions that there is a firbolg [Astorrel Lieutenant](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/5-lieutenant.md) that works for her, which by this point the party will have already met.
