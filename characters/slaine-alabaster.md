## Summary

Slaine Alabaster was a mischievous and greedy member of [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) who contracted [Meteoridis](../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md) from the [Silethwaite meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md). It has been slowly consuming him ever since.

*See: [Talk to the Morning Chasers](../storylines/ended/talk-to-the-morning-chasers.md)*

Slaine died when [Wizira](wizira.md) cast Dispel Magic on the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) in his possession. Doing so caused the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) to consume his body, killing him in the process and turning him into a [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md).

## History

While in [Silethwaite](../places/settlements/villages/silethwaite.md) with [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) who were contracted to [Astral squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), the party found a mysterious clearing in the forest that appeared to have been logged. In it Slaine Alabaster found the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md).

Not feeling it was related to the site, [Janneke Borflast](janneke-borflast.md) allowed Slaine to keep it. When the group returned to [Astral squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), they made no mention of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), feeling it was an unrelated treasure which they were entitled to keep.

Over the following months, Slaine spent more and more time in the presence of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), eventually experimenting with some of the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) contained within. As he continued, the compulsions grew stronger, eventually preventing him from letting go of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). When Janneke or [Kieran Bennington](kieran-bennington.md) have tried to part him with it, he has lashed out explosively.
