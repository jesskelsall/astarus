## History

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain.md)

Mordus Shren will be behind the bar when the party enters, happy to see new faces in their small town. He hopes they'll stay a while.

The following morning, when the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) come looking for the party, Mordus can be seen looking glum as the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) state who they're looking for. He is visibly deflated by the realisation that he welcomed known criminals into his inn.

Mordus tells the [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) that they checked in last night and they may still be here.
