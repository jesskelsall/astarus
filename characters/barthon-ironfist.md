## History

He found [Ahsha Sallas](ahsha-sallas.md) in [Mockerkin](../places/towns/mockerkin.md), fighting (and winning) against anyone who got in her way, and offered to take her to [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) where she would become a pit fighter.

Barthon spent several years training Ahsha in the ways of pit fighting, particularly fist fighting, his specialty.

They parted ways when Ahsha decided to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) recruitment programme.
