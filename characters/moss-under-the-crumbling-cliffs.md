## Summary

Moss Under the Crumbling Cliffs is the owner of the magic shop [Friend of the Magicborn](../places/buildings/shops/friend-of-the-magicborn.md) in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md).

She is a confident, stern and mysterious woman that speaks evasively and condescendingly to those she doesn't know. Her instinct is to trust no-one, and so she judges harshly and watches carefully. She never leaves the counter while someone is in her store.
