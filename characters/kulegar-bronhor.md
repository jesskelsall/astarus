## History

Kulegar is originally from [Eaglesfield](../places/settlements/towns/eaglesfield.md). He became friends with [Nenra Zossa](nenra-zossa.md) and her late husband Grice while they were practising Malneshi there. He agreed to help form [Arnaside](../places/settlements/villages/arnaside.md) when Grice suggested it.

Since moving to [Arnaside](../places/settlements/villages/arnaside.md), Kulegar has been working to leverage logging as a material that the village can trade with the outside world for supplies they can't make or grow themselves.

## Planning

### Trouble in [Arnaside](../places/settlements/villages/arnaside.md)

Kulegar is helping the other loggers tidy up the kobolds' mess when the party arrives. He is determining that a broken wheel on the logging cart that was attacked cannot be repaired.

Information he can tell the party:

- The creatures attack at night, usually when it's windy.
- They've been stealing supplies from the [Arnaside Logging Camp](../places/structures/arnaside-logging-camp.md) and from the village itself.
- Several loggers have been injured by traps set in the forest.
