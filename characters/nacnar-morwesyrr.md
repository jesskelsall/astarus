## History

Nacnar Morwesyrr was raised in [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md), eventually joining the Reime Rim to defend the Reime Jungle from incursions from the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) and to protect the state's territory from [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) interests.

She left the organisation under mysterious circumstances, leaving her home state in search of purpose further north in the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md). Eventually she came across [Vulpes Geen](vulpes-geen.md) who took her in and invited her to join [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md), her new family.

The pair spent over a decade adventuring together. Nacnar was present for many of [The Metal Fox](vulpes-geen.md)'s greatest adventures. The pair forged a strong friendship on the battlefield, covering each other implicitly when situations got dicey.

On one of their adventures they met [Vētrall Astérr](vetrall-asterr.md), whose air genasi lineage and associated powers caught the attention of Geen. He invited them to join [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md), making Nacnar their mentor, a role they were reluctant to play.

When Nacnar wasn't off adventuring with [Vulpes Geen](vulpes-geen.md) himself, she would teach Vētrall sword fighting with a rapier as well as survival and adventuring skills. Her ethos of functional combat over flair rubbed off on Vētrall initially, though they would later grow an ego as their powers did too, something Nacnar would not deny them.
