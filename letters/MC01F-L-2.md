## Transcript

> [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md),
>
> That damned brown bear is back.
>
> It mauled one of the villagers again. It's about time someone dealt with it!
>
> As none of my guards are brave enough to go looking for it, would you be able to help?
>
> We can't offer much right now, but we can spare 20 gold for whoever you send and 20 gold more for the family.
>
> Whoever you send, point them my way and I'll tell them everything they need to know.
>
> You know where to find me!
