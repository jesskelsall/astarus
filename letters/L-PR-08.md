>
> Dear [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md),
>
> I am writing to express my sincere congratulations on your [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad's performance in the 28th [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) tournament.
>
> Being selected for such a prestigious event is an incredible honour in and of itself. Making it to the tournament final shows equal measures of skill and resolve. There is no doubt in my mind that [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s performance captured the imagination of many festival goers - myself included.
>
> I wish you all well on your [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) missions. May they all be swift and safe. As an [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md) for the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) guard, I know first hand the value of uneventful days.
>
> If you find yourselves in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) again, I would very much like the opportunity to meet you all.
>
> With [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md)'s desire,

> Torbra,
>
> It is a pleasure to be writing to a fellow earth genasi - in fact you are the reason I now have a name for who I am. Thank you dearly for this gift.
>
> My life has been one of questions, loneliness, and unrest. This world has made me unlike others, but offered no cause or explanation. Through this I have come to understand that by its very nature, existence is cruel. I wonder how being genasi has shaped your world view.
>
> My mother was a kind woman who gave everything of herself to raising my twin brother and I. He is not like you and I. For one he did not live to see adolescence.
>
> I never knew my father. My mother remembered him fondly - an [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) soldier who promised to return from the war to meet his newborn children. War has a way of breaking promises. I joined the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) in an attempt to discovery who my father was in life, but it could never tell me who he was in birth, or if he was a crucial element of my genasi lineage.
>
> [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) informs me that you are an orphan. Through your years have you gained any insights or knowledge of how you were born like me?
>
> Sengras
