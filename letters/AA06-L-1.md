> Dear [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md),
>
> It is my great pleasure to invite you to compete in the [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) tournament as part of the upcoming [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival.
>
> As you may already be aware, the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) celebrates the end of Taledus and the beginning of Shavdor as the months pass from [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) to [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md). The return of [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) troops from our colder climates for the winter brings an opportunity to share in their stories and feast on the harvest's bounty, while those who can fight have opportunities to prove their worth.
>
> In light of your early successes in [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) and your squad's inclusion of a receiver of the Exceptional Trainee Bonus, [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) and I have shortlisted you for the tournament alongside seven other squads from your graduate cohort.
>
> This is an excellent opportunity for new graduates to make names for themselves through honour and glory, competing in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) in Astor's most prominent arena, [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md). The tournament is the centrepiece of the festival, taking place over all three days. It is typically attended by thousands of [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), citizens, and people of Astor alike. If that's not enough incentive for you, the winning squad will receive the favour of the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) and 100 platinum coins.
>
> Should you wish to accept, please write back to me in good time. My office will then begin taking care of travel and accommodation arrangements.
>
> Regardless, best of luck to you all in your endeavours.
>
> Sincerely,
>
