> The [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) have reached [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). Two guards and the [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) were killed as the group fought their way to the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) stronghold. It is unclear what their intentions are. [Astornox commandant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-commandant.md) [Itharmund Steeleye](../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) has demanded that the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) release them immediately so they can be brought to justice.

> Protests in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md). Locals fight for the rights of Firbolgs in the [Mocker Swamp](../places/forests/mocker-swamp.md). The [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) took swift action to punish these troublemakers for disturbance of the peace and challenging the judgement of Captain [Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md).

> Construction of the Southern Temple has finished. [Yeatscale](../places/cities/yeatscale.md)'s temple to [The Order of the Diamond](../organisations/the-order-of-the-diamond.md) was completed with an opening ceremony by General Supreme [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md) himself. Glory to the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) and her ambitions in South [Kardan](../places/continents/kardan.md).
>
> New [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) graduates begin their service! 100 new [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have joined the organisation's ranks after the graduation ceremony led by [Astorrel Commandant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md) [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) and Captain [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md). They will join the mission to preserve [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md)'s blessings and keep the great [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)'s ambitions in balance with their will.
