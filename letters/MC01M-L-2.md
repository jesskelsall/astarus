## Transcript

> Crucible,
>
> [The Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) is dead.
>
> A brief window of chaos is open. There is profit to be had if we act quickly.
>
> Vulpes Geex has joined our cause. He has promised to feed us information. A promise he made in person to me.
>
> This songbird should satisfy your need for proof, I would hope.
>
> As a welcoming gift, Geex provides us this gem:
>
> [The Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) is holding something in the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md). What he does not know.
>
> Whoever gains it from his will should be coming straight here to collect it. **Be ready.**
>
> Rumour has it, this could be where [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md) is kept.  
> If so we will all be rich beyond our wildest dreams.
>
> I have a buyer lined up.
>
> Have fun,  
> Creek
