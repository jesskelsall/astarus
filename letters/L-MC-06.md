## Transcript

> Hello.
>
> You're reading this because I left you the key to this box in my will.  
> If that's not the case, I hope your reputation as a thief grows to the point where it ends you.
>
> This strange shiny ball is my prized possession.  
> That may sound ridiculous but it's true.  
> My sword and armour are better known, but I would have given them both up to keep hold of this ball.
>
> As I write this it is the only thing that ever defeated [The Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md). By now my death has been added to that short list.
>
> In truth I have no idea what it is or does.
>
> When I was still a young adventurer I was asked to investigate a murder while in [Arrepont](../places/cities/arrepont.md). A noble elf called [Guillaume Ashshard](../characters/guillaume-ashshard.md) had been murdered in his home. I was able to track down the killer, a returner.  
> He refused to back down when I confronted him.  
> He left me no choice but to end his days.  
> I still regret what I did.
>
> On him I found this ball. Strangely I felt like I was expecting to find it. Maybe that is why I acted the way I did? Either way it was now mine, but I didn't mention it when I returned to the family for my reward. I couldn't.

> After that I dreamed of it over and over.  
> A mix of guilt, worry, and curiosity. I thought that my mind couldn't handle breaking my adventuring code, but there was something more to it. I don't have the words for how or why it was often on my mind.
>
> I tried looking for someone who could help me understand what the ball is, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. What if I was labelled a thief? My life would be over. Raine was kind enough to reply to my letters but I never visited them in [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md).
>
> Eventually I had to lock this thing away, but I've never forgotten about it.
>
> I have a reputation for being bold and brave.  
> It's funny that this part of my life is so secret.  
> I hope you are able to keep it that way. I work very hard to be the adventurer that people rely on.  
> It's how I want to be remembered.
>
> Please be careful with it. It was precious to me, so I hope you feel the same. Hopefully it helps you connect to the original me - the scared young [fennec](../lineages/fennec.md) behind the adventurer.
>
> And if you're able to figure out what it is, then you have the honour of having done something that I could not.  
> That's a victory over "[The Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)" in my eyes!
>
> Stand strong and carve your own legacy.
