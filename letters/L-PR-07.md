> Dear Torbra,
>
> I'm writing to let you know that Montel and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) have made it to [Iredale](../places/settlements/towns/iredale.md) safely.  
> I'd imagine this news comes as a relief.
>
> The pair arrived yesterday by cart, looking for somewhere to stay. When they asked for me and mentioned your name, I was thrilled to learn that since leaving home you've been doing much good.
>
> Your parents were reassured when I visited to tell them of your exploits, your mother cried to know you were safe. I had to explain to them what it meant that you are now [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md), and how rare an honour that is. I can scarcely believe that you are already part of their ranks - I'm sure that'll make for a fine story next we meet!
>
> I've done what I can to help the Leithrans to settle, as Montel is keen to make a home here. As Captain of [Iredale](../places/settlements/towns/iredale.md) it is difficult for me to grant favours to elves without raising suspicion, but I've already silenced a few concerned voices within my guard. They are welcome here.
>
> Your parents agreed to take the Leithrans in.  
> Emelina was particularly keen - she says Esme reminds her of you when you were younger. Ealo has work for Montel which will get him established here.
>
> Emelina and Ealo pass on their love, wishing that you stay warm, fed, and treat your companions as well as you did these elves. They wish you'd write to them when you are able. If it's easier you can write to me and I'll pass it on.
>
> Teresa and Einra pass on their well wishes too. Einra keeps bragging to others about knowing someone who fought hard in [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md). I imagine by the time you return to us, you'll be a local legend.
>
> Stay safe,  
> Your friend,
>
