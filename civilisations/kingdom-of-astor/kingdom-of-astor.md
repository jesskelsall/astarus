## Summary

The Kingdom of Astor (shortened: *Astor*) is a militocracy located in [south east Kardan](../../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md). It borders the [Syntenne Republic](../syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) to its south and the [Dardenn Kingdom](../dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md) to its north.

It is the primary setting for [campaigns](../../../campaigns/README.md) set in [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md).

## Imagery

### Symbol

Its symbol is a red ruby, a diamond looked at straight on but actually a square based pyramid. It resembles the symbol of [The Order of the Diamond](../../organisations/the-order-of-the-diamond.md).

## Governance

The Kingdom of Astor is a militocracy. This means that the entire governance structure is based on a military chain of command, including ranks. Each member of the military has a superior officer who provides them orders, and who issues their punishment if they fail to carry them out.

All of Astor's decision making resides within these military ranks.

Ultimate power resides with the *general supreme*, [Corville Thornox](../../characters/corville-thornox.md). He is the superior officer of the generals of the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md), who in turn are superior officers to the other organisations of the kingdom.

## Organisations

Those who are part of one of these organisations are considered to be part of Astor's military, due to their subservience to their superior officer. They can generically describe themselves as a *military member*.

- [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md): ruling generals in charge of the kingdom and other organisations.
- [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md): army, war efforts, local government, guards, protection of the citizens.
- [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md): upholders of the balance between civilisation and nature.
- [Astornos](../../organisations/astornos.md): researchers of [the meteoric threat](../../storylines/the-meteoric-threat.md).

## Politics

Power is absolute in Astor, dictated by military rank.

The best way to influence politics is to serve the military and ascend the ranks. This can only be done by their superiors, leading to a conservative society with a stable political nature.

Drigg inciting revolution tend to be oppressed by the military, and citizens attempting change outside of the military hierarchy are punished severely, often on treason charges.

## Culture

### Day To Day Life

The people of Astor are largely content with their lot in life and feel fortunate to have their place in the world. A stable society means typically there is little to worry about. Common folk take pride in their work and craftsmen give it their all.

Those wanting a better position in life join the military, largely for the benefits that come from citizenship, accepting the hardships of military life as a consequence.

Ambitious people join the military and quickly learn how to please their superiors, ascending into positions of power from which they can attempt to spread their influence, or rest on their laurels and enjoy the finer things in life.

### Class Structure

Class is ultimately determined by military rank. The higher the rank attained while serving in the military, the more status, influence, and wealth that the individual accrues.

These benefits are for the individual, and are not inherited by their spouse or children, though they may benefit from a nicer house and access to money & education.

Upon retirement from the military, the benefits of an individual are retained.

#### Citizens

Not all Astorians are citizens - this is a societal construct that must be earned. Citizens can:

- Own land.
- Buy and live in their own property.
- Create and operate their own business.

Citizenship is earned after 4 years of service in the military. After this point a military member may choose to resign as long as it is not vetoed by their superior officer.

#### Drigg

Non-citizens are colloquially referred to as *drigg*. This term is only used by citizens to refer to others, and is typically seen as a derogatory word by non-citizens.

Drigg are unable to support themselves and must rely on the housing and work of others. This is equivocal to medieval serfdom. There are few prospects in life other than serving the benefits of citizens.

Despite this, many drigg are happy with their role in life, happy to be contributing to their kingdom or local community.

### Equality and Injustice

*See also: [Magicborn](magicborn.md)*

The main injustices in the Kingdom of Astor is the rank based class structure and lack of basic rights for all residents. [Magicborn](magicborn.md) are oppressed far greater than any other group.

Despite this, Astor is incredibly tolerant of race, religion, and identity. It welcomes anyone who wishes to reside within its borders. There is no concept of “native races”, and those who move here are given equal chances to those born here.

The glaring exception is elves and half-elves who are seen as untrustworthy and seditious, due to their association with the [Syntenne Republic](../syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).

### Education

Education is not a universal right. It is only available to those who can afford it, or as part of certain levels of military training.

## History

*See also: [Timeline](../../history/timeline.md)*

### Formation

The Kingdom of Astor was established over 300 years ago. Within around 50 years it had codified its style of governance and the state religion, [The Order of the Diamond](../../organisations/the-order-of-the-diamond.md).

### War with the [Syntenne Republic](../syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md)

As Astor grew, it expanded south along the coast and quickly came into conflict with the [Syntenne Republic](../syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). War broke out over this region, eventually engulfing the entirety of south [Kardan](../../places/continents/kardan.md).

Astor was outmatched by Syntenne due to their lower numbers. Despite this, Astor soldiers fought valiantly, with Syntenne fearing their tenacity and unwillingness to surrender or retreat.

Eventually Syntenne began pushing Astor back up the western coast and towards the capital city of [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md), but were unable to push around [Duskmere](../../places/rivers-lakes/duskmere.md), the lake to its west.

A surprise attack up the [River Humar](../../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) and into [Duskmere](../../places/rivers-lakes/duskmere.md) by the Syntenne navy broke the stalemate and led to the siege of [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md).

Astor held the line but losing the city seemed inevitable. The King of Astor, realising how critical magic users had been in the defense efforts so far, ordered a conscription of all magic users in the kingdom in order to bolster the military forces and attempt to break the siege.

This plan worked, and swiftly the newly empowered army was able to push Syntenne all the way back to the southern reaches of the current Astor border.

Here the tide of battle turned again, and Astor sued for an armistice, which Syntenne, tired from fighting, was more than happy to agree to.
