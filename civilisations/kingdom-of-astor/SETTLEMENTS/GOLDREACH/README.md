## Summary

Goldreach is a town in [northern Astor](../../../../places/regions/northern-astor.md). It is the northernmost settlement along the [Northern Road](../../../../places/roads/northern-road.md), and the last before entering the [Dardenn Kingdom](../../../dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md).

The quaint rural town is set amongst expansive grassy plains, penned in by the [Hawkswood](../../../../places/forests/hawkswood.md) to the west and the [Winster Forest](../../../../places/forests/winster-forest.md) to the east, with views of the mountains to the north providing a dramatic backdrop.

Built on a natural spring in the plains, Goldreach is not walled and rarely in any danger due to the amicable relationship with the [Dardenn Kingdom](../../../dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md) to the north. It is built around a Marketplace and features an Order of the Diamond temple, an [Astornox](../../../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) stronghold with an outer wall, lively shops and a few notable inns.

It is known for its cosmopolitan residents, bustling trade, and general good hospitality, making it a favourite rest stop for frequent travelers. There are many farms in the vicinity, so it is an agricultural hub with much food and animals passing through it.

| Sensation | Description |

| Sights | Medium sized rural town set amongst the plains, with forests to the east and west, and mountains visible on the north horizon.

| Sounds | Chatter from locals. Horses and carts. Children playing in the streets. Market trade. |
| Smells | Mud, horse manure, livestock, ale. |
| People | Cosmopolitan mix of people of all races and levels of the social order. [Astornox](../../../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) stronghold, well off citizens. |
| Intrigue | A bustling and peaceful town along a busy trade route. |
