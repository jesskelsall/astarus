| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Wooden beamed interior filled with a bar on its far wall and plenty of round tables and stools. There is a staircase behind the bar leading up to the rooms upstairs, and a kitchen behind the bar itself. |
| Sounds | Revelers chatting, cheering, tankards being slammed against tables. |
| Smells | Sweat, ale, wet wood. Occasional wafts of meat from the kitchen. |
| People | Healthy mix of poor drigg and well-to-do citizens. The happy, the merry, and the miserable. Usually very civil due to its proximity to the [Goldreach Astornox Stronghold](goldreach-astornox-stronghold.md).|
| Intrigue | The main inn in the center of town. |
