## Summary

Flute Street is where the wealthier citizens of [Goldreach](../README.md) live, and is where [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../../../people/alistair-hawthorn.md)â€™s House can be found.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Two storey cottage houses with well maintained gardens including flowers and hedges. Quaint country vibes. Clean cobbled street. [Astornox](../../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) fort wall on the opposite side of the street. Guard towers keeping a keen eye on trouble. |
| Sounds | Birds chirping. |
| Smells | Floral smells from the flowers. Lack of typical town smells. |
| People | Quiet except for guarding [Astornox](../../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). |
| Intrigue | An especially well maintained street that exudes wealth, despite its view of the town wall. |

## History

### [PR03](../../../../../../campaigns/purple-rain/sessions/PR03.md) / [PR04](../../../../../../campaigns/purple-rain/sessions/PR04.md)

*See: [Finding the Goldreach Meteorite](../../../../../../campaigns/purple-rain/storylines/finding-the-goldreach-meteorite.md)*

The [Purple Rain](../../../../../../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party had agreed to meet [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../../../people/wrenn-piznarck.md) at 12 Flute Street in order to help him locate the [Goldreach](../README.md) Meteorite. They found the house with the help of an [Astornox guard](../../../organisations/astornox/ranks/1-guard.md), who they provided a code word to courtesy of Wrenn.
