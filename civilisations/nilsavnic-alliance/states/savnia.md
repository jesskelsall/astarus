## Summary

One of the two founding states of the [Nil'Savnic alliance](../nilsavnic-alliance.md). Savnia was created by force when following The Third Coming, the arriving races sought territory to the south of [Arrepont](../../../places/cities/arrepont.md), displacing the elves who had called these lands home for thousands of years.

Following the founding of the alliance and the inclusion of [Reimatelau](reimatelau.md), Savnia is now known as the administrative capital of the alliance.
