## Summary

One of the two founding states of the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../nilsavnic-alliance.md), the entire state runs between the [Nilus Peaks](../../../places/mountains/nilus-peaks.md) to its north and the [Gulf of Tanelle](../../../places/seas-oceans/gulf-of-tanelle.md) to its south. Easy access to the seas provides prosperity through seafaring trade, though at the cost of being the first land targeted by [Kavallos Fleet](../../kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) raids.
