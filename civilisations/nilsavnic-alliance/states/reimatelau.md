## Summary

Reimatelau is an elven state founded so that elven civilisation could join the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../nilsavnic-alliance.md). After [Savnia](savnia.md) was forcibly formed from elven territory, the elven cities that wished to integrate into the new world following The Third Coming agreed to join their growing alliance.
