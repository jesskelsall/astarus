## Summary

Reimatelau is a predominantly elven state located in the Reime Jungle. It is a member of the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../nilsavnic-alliance.md).

In contrast to the [Syntenne Republic](../../syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) to its far south, Reimatelau is welcoming of non-elven races and has made efforts over its history to adapt to and elevate other peoples and cultures, both inside and outside of its borders.

## Governance

Reimatelau is a magocracy - the most magically gifted individual in each settlement becomes their ruler. While this is regardless of race, elves live longer than most races, giving them an unfair advantage when it comes to accumulating magical knowledge. These [magicborn](../../kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) are referred to as "arch-mages".

Each arch-mage consults their citizens and advisors frequently. They are expected to be humble, kind, and compassionate.

## Organisations

- [Unicorn Cavalry](../../../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md)

## Politics

Reimatelau is a fully integrated member of the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../nilsavnic-alliance.md), representing the interests of elves within the alliance, particularly in matters of heritage.

The [Syntenne Republic](../../syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) sees Reimatelau as traitors to the legacy of the Elves of Chausain, typically distrusting them. Despite this they have several uneasy agreements of mutual benefit, such as both having a guard presence in [Côtedouce](../../../places/towns/cotedouce.md), and Reimatelau providing access to [Arrepont](../../../places/cities/arrepont.md) through [Savnia](savnia.md).

## Culture

In typically elven fashion, Reimatelau is almost exclusively large isolated cities rather than creating new settlements when the existing ones swell to a certain size. This gives each settlement its own identity and culture, though all share strong similarities.

The ruling arch-mages and the [Unicorn Cavalry](../../../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) go to great lengths to be inclusive of other races, upholding their rights within the civilisation. Any suggestions that Reimatelau is only for elves or that non-elves are lesser are quickly squashed and punished.

## History

In the wake of [the Third Coming](../../../history/events/the-third-coming.md), many elves living in modern day [Savnia](savnia.md) were displaced from [Naissance](../../../places/cities/arrepont.md) and its surrounding territory by the sudden influx of new people. Forced south by the new coalition of races that would eventually codify as [Savnia](savnia.md), the elves fled beyond the Vie Marshland and made their stand in the Reime Jungle.

Faced with a new sudden and harsh reality that the elves were no longer the dominant race in western [Kardan](../../../places/continents/kardan.md), many fled even further south to join the [Syntenne Republic](../../syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), embracing their isolationist and historical ways. Those that were left united under a common unicorn banner - Reimatelau.

For decades there were on and off wars on the edge of the jungle and up as far as Vouvant as Reimatelau tried to regain control of the now renamed city of [Arrepont](../../../places/cities/arrepont.md) from [Savnia](savnia.md).

Eventually with the rise of the [Kavallos Fleet](../../kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) and other neighbouring powers such as the [Kingdom of Astor](../../kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), [Savnia](savnia.md) and the [Nilus Coast](nilus-coast.md) entered into an alliance - the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../nilsavnic-alliance.md). Unable to hold their own against a neighbour growing in size, Reimatelau sued for peace, realising that they would be better off embracing their new neighbours rather than resisting them.

This started a period of introspection for these elves where they learned to embrace others and celebrate them and their cultures. Impressed by the culture and knowledge of the elves themselves, many people moved to Reimatelau, forming a mixed society that would come to define the state.

Before long Reimatelau was invited to join the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../nilsavnic-alliance.md). They did so under the conditions that elves displaced by [the Third Coming](../../../history/events/the-third-coming.md) would be able to return to their settlements in [Savnia](savnia.md), and that access to [Arrepont](../../../places/cities/arrepont.md) should be guaranteed to any elf regardless of state or political affiliation.
