## Summary

Valburg is known for its rolling fields, views of [Lake Gondra](../../../places/topography/rivers-lakes/lake-gondra.md),
and its powerhouse agriculture. The wealth that flows into the state
has led to an architectural renaissance that rivals the elven cities of [Reimatelau](reimatelau.md) and the [Syntenne Republic](../../syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).
