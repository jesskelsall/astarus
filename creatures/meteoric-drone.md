## Description

> Meteoric Drones are flying creatures that excel at harassing ground targets, keeping their attention away from other meteorics present on the battlefield. They are only encountered in a [Meteoric Mind](meteoric-mind.md)'s lair, supporting other creatures in the thick of combat.
>
> With a humanoid frame consisting of two legs and four arms, the Meteoric Drone looks vaguely humanoid except for its lack of a head and its stony dark grey exterior, resistant against most forms of physical damage. Its back is surrounded by a constantly moving swarm of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) that rips from its back two large vortices that propel it through the air nimbly, allowing it to hover and change direction quickly.
>
> With four arms the Meteoric Drone projects blasts of force energy from each, striking its targets with pinpoint accuracy at a moment's notice. When the situation is desperate or there is an opportunity, it hovers over its prey before dive bombing them, collapsing its dusty form upon them, burying them underneath.
