| **Type** | Construct / Humanoid |

## Description

> A humanoid that has succumbed to the influence of a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), becoming one with the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) it is comprised of.
>
> With a hardened skin of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), the Meteoric Humanoid has a dark grey and featureless exterior, the dust coating their every surface and removing any last traces of their humanity. Their eyes are stained a glowing bright purple by what remains of the meteor's magic, rarely opening to influence its opponents. The humanoid's arms are shaped by the dust into long blades below the elbow, resembling a preying mantis.
>
> The Meteoric Humanoid wanders slowly, lashing out at those it comes across with little rhyme or reason, defending itself if need be. Preferring to use its blade arms in close quarters, it can also wail hauntingly through its mouth which the dust is beginning to close permanently, making it a dangerous foe if left unchecked.

## Summary

Meteoric Humanoids are rare manifestations of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), only capable of being created when a humanoid that contracts [Meteoridis](../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md) is deeply under its influences. This allows the magic within a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) to bind itself to the humanoid, creating a hybrid creature of flesh and dust. This change is irreversible and kills the humanoid in the process.

Meteoric Humanoids are a compromise between the magic of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) and the form of the base humanoid. As such it does not possess the typical resistances and weaknesses found in most of [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md).

When killed, the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) becomes inert, sloughing off the humanoid body. This reveals a fleshy remain that does not resemble the humanoid, instead resembling a mass of flesh. The skin and features have been ripped apart by the violent nature of the dust and the ways it modified its host for its own needs.
