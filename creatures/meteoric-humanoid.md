## Description

> A humanoid that has succumbed to the influence of a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), becoming one with the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) it is comprised of.
>
> With a hardened skin of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), the Meteoric Humanoid has a dark grey and featureless exterior, the dust coating their every surface and removing any last traces of their humanity. Their eyes are stained a glowing bright purple by what remains of the meteor's magic, rarely opening to influence its opponents. The humanoid's arms are shaped by the dust into long blades below the elbow, resembling a preying mantis.
>
> The Meteoric Humanoid wanders slowly, lashing out at those it comes across with little rhyme or reason, defending itself if need be. Preferring to use its blade arms in close quarters, it can also wail hauntingly through its mouth which the dust is beginning to close permanently, making it a dangerous foe if left unchecked.
