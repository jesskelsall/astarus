## Description

> A creature that has arrived to this world from a meteor, hatched from the egg-like sphere that fell from the sky.
>
> The Meteoric Watcher is a strange creature to describe. Resembling a quadruped at first glance, it has two hind legs, two front blade-like arms, with two humanoid arms behind them. It is dark grey and resembles stone, but moves in a bizarre fashion, resembling a running dog one moment and a rotating construct the next. Its head has no features aside from its ears, and purple glowing eyes.
>
> Watchers tend to lurk in places devoid of life, only venturing out to learn what they can about other life and intelligent civilisation. They study those who attack them keenly, using hit and run tactics to inflict wounds before teleporting away.
