## Description

> Meteoric Watchers are scouts for [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md), sent into new territories to observe and learn about the intelligent races they encounter. Their exceptional vision makes it hard for any detail to escape their gaze.
>
> In combat Meteoric Watchers teleport to their prey, slashing them with their blade like arms before teleporting away. They are a nuisance that can be hard to pin down without careful planning. Their purple glowing eyes are also distracting to those fighting around them.
>
> With the silhouette of a wolf, Meteoric Watchers are no normal creature. Their quadrupedal frame has two extra limbs protruding from its shoulders, with elbow-like joints and blade shaped forearms. Their body appears to be made of muscle and bone, but is actually comprised of a hardened dark grey stony material that is hard to penetrate. Their heads are devoid of features except for round ear holes and piercing eyes that only appear when they open.
>
> Meteoric Watchers move with animalistic grace but can also contort and reconfigure their body as needed, underlying their non-organic nature.
