## Description

> A creature formed from [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), originating from a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) that crashed to the ground.
>
> The Meteoric Hunter has a silhouette resembling a slightly larger wolf, but with two extra front arms that come to sharp blade-like points. Spiny protrusions emerge from its head, back, and the back of its legs. Its head is smooth and comes to a point, not containing any eyes, mouth, or ears.
>
> Its body is made of a hard dark grey substance that it can shift, loosening the bonds between each particle to shift at a moment's notice. Otherwise it gives the impression of flesh and muscle anatomy in the way it is shaped and moves.
>
> Meteoric Hunters are guided by [Meteoric Watchers](meteoric-watcher.md), ruthlessly seeking their prey and ending their lives. They operate cautiously by day and brazenly by night, using their darkened form to pass quickly through the darkness. Blind, they rely on their extensive blindsight to follow and attack their prey.
