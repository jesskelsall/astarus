## Description

> Meteoric Hunters are savage creatures made for only one purpose - killing. They excel at hunting down prey that can be used for its biomass, as well as curious people that have seen too much.
>
> In combat Meteoric Hunters try to focus on the most dangerous threat they can perceive, racing towards the largest sound with a sudden burst of energy. They are blind but are fearless at trying to pin their foe down before cutting it deep with their two blade arms. And if that wasn't bad enough, they can momentarily disassemble the grains that comprise their body, dodging sword and magical bolt alike.
>
> Similar to their smaller counterpart, the Meteoric Hunter, [Meteoric Watchers](meteoric-watcher.md) have a bipedal silhouette that resembles a wolf covered in spines across its back and along the back of its legs. Two extra limbs protrude from its shoulders, with elbow-like joints and blade shaped forearms. Their body appears to be made of muscle and bone, but is actually comprised of a hardened dark grey stony material that is hard to penetrate. Their head is featureless and triangular, coming to a point where a snout would be.
>
> Meteoric Hunters move with animalistic grace but can also reshape their body at will, becoming a flowing sand-like liquid that flows through the air, always settling back on a version of its original form.
