## Description

> When a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) lands, a consciousness from within decides what form its [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) will take, and what it will try to accomplish. This is the Meteoric Mind. When enough [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) is created from biomass, it can take its own form, a threat in its own right to anyone that ventures near its lair.
>
> Meteoric Minds are incredibly intelligent, adapting its strategy to its surroundings and the information brought to it by other meteorics it creates. It is able to consume biomass to grow its stock of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), then turn that dust into more creatures, or recycle creatures that are wounded or no longer needed.
>
> If encountered directly, a Meteoric Mind commands its creatures, working to subvert its foes strengths and exploit their weaknesses. It takes a humanoid form in the centre of its lair, projecting an anti-magic bubble that affords it a level of protection. For those unlucky to fall into its carpet of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), it can instruct the dust to pass over the creature as speed, cutting it thousands of times and ripping it to shreds.
>
> A Meteoric Mind's humanoid form is made of rapidly moving [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) that rises up from the floor, giving the sense of a humanoid shape. It can appear solid one second and flowing the next, never staying put for long. From within its dark grey form glows two ever present purple eyes, the flow of dust giving them an erratic appearance.

## Lair

> Initially residing in the crater caused when its [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crash landed, a Meteoric Mind can move its lair by moving its surplus of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) across the land, collecting it wherever it needs to be to further its goals.
>
> Easily disguised as a simple dark grey sandy patch, the lair can be still without little indication that danger is present. The best sign is if the surrounding landscape has been stripped of its biomass, an ominous sign to those that venture near.
>
> In the heat of battle, the Meteoric Mind instructs its carpet of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to move, creating terrain that is hard to traverse, and cutting those who fall into it.

Initially residing in the crater caused when its [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crash landed, a Meteoric Mind can move its lair by moving its surplus of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) across the land, collecting it wherever it needs to be to further its goals.

Easily disguised as a simple dark grey sandy patch, the lair can be still without little indication that danger is present. The best sign is if the surrounding landscape has been stripped of its biomass, an ominous sign to those that venture near.

In the heat of battle, the Meteoric Mind instructs its carpet of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to move, creating terrain that is hard to traverse, and cutting those who fall into it.
Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Meteoric Mind takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

    Reconfigure: The Meteoric Mind can create and/or destroy as many meteoric creatures as it wishes that are touching its [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). Creating a creature subtracts its starting hit points from those of the Meteoric Mind. Destroying a creature adds the creature's current hit points to that of the Meteoric Mind. The Meteoric Mind cannot reduce itself to 0 hit points using this lair action.
    Dust Surge: The [Meteoric Hunter](meteoric-hunter.md) orders all of its [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to surge in a direction of its choosing, centered on its position: towards, away, clockwise, counter-clockwise. Any non-meteoric creature that is [condition]prone[/condition] takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage. All other non-meteoric creatures standing in the dust must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [condition]prone[/condition].

---

Multiattack. The Meteoric Mind attacks twice, once with each of its blade arms.

Blade Arm. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range 5ft, one target. Hit: 4 (1d6) slashing damage.

Mindfield (Recharge: 6). The Meteoric Mind protects a 10 foot bubble sphere of anti-magic focused on it . Any magic that attempts to pass through the bubble is nullified, though the inside of the bubble is not anti-magic. If the Meteoric Mind moves or is moved after the bubble appears, it dissipates instantly. This ability does not recharge while active.
