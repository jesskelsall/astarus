# Valburgisch

## Summary

Valburgisch is the official language of [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md). It is equivocal to real-world German.

## History

The language that would become known as valburgisch originated on [Oonar](../celestial-objects/oonar.md) in places where humans and dwarves lived together in close collaboration. As a result the language has a mixed origin of common and dwarvish.

Valburgisch arrived on [Astarus](../celestial-objects/astarus.md) through [the Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md). When [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) was formed by a mixed population of humans, elves, and dwarves, the language was selected as the official language, used to create an intentional break with tradition that would help make [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) a distinctly new civilisation.

Today Valburgisch is rarely spoken outside of [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md), though it seems some usage in the [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md). While many common speakers may understand the gist of a valburgisch sentence, it is typically only learned through living in [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) or directed study to that end.
