# Elvish

## Summary

Elvish is the language of elves. It is equivocal to real-world French.

## History

The Elves of Chausain used elvish as their official language, and so it was the predominant language of the city state. Following the Fall of Chausain and [the Second Coming](../history/events/the-second-coming.md), elvish arrived on [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md).

Prior to [the Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md), elvish grew in usage, pushing out common as there were no other races to communicate in common with. The races of [the First Coming](../history/events/the-first-coming.md) used their own languages which aren't compatible with common, so elves learned celestial, draconic, and giant.

Following [the Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md), a variety of other languages were introduced to [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md), necessitating a need for elves to adapt linguistically once more.

Today elvish is the official language of the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) and [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md), but also sees use in [Savnia](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/savnia.md). Most elves speak it fluently and are taught it from a young age as a form of cultural heritage.
