## Summary

Oonar is a large planet with two moons, a "cradle of life" populated by ancient [gods](../gods/gods.md) with some of the first sentient life.

Long-lived civilisations with storied relationships vie for land and resources. There is a notable dichotomy between civilisations that lean heavily on magic, and those that shun it.

## Land

Oonar's terrain is highly varied, with large inland seas and two large oceans.

Due to a lack of axial tilt, there are no seasons on Oonar. Instead, latitude strongly dictates biome and climate: closer to the poles is wintery tundra, while the equator is scorching desert. This has kept civilisation within the areas between, with two hemispheres that rarely interact.

## Sky

During the day the sky is teal coloured, fading to yellow and peach tones around sunrise and sunset. The sun isn't as bright as on [Astarus](astarus.md) and is orange. 

During the night the sky is brown coloured.

The appearance of stars is dependent on the proximity of [Unevaire](unevaire.md). When the moon is close, stars are bright and twinkle across the night and even day sky, with nebulae visible to the naked eye at sunrise and sunset. When [Unevaire](unevaire.md) is far away, only the brightest stars are visible at night.

## Civilisations

The Elves of Chausain is the only named civilisation on Oonar so far.

## [Gods](../gods/gods.md)

A long list of [gods](../gods/gods.md) have a stake in Oonar and its peoples. After sentient life was created by the first of these, various others have managed to carve out their own followings.

Arriving in the early years with [Unevaire](unevaire.md), [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) is wholly responsible for Oonar's magic, leading to a strong following amongst various magical civilisations. [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md) et al. have moderate followings of smaller civilisations.

On Oonar, the influence and existence of the [gods](../gods/gods.md) is understood and periodically witnessed, instilling a strong sense of belief, even in civilisations that reject magic.

| God | Influence |
| --- | --- |
| [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) | Strong |
| [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md), [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md), [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md), [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) | Medium |

## Magic

On Oonar magic is strong but comes and goes in waves, tied to the proximity of [Unevaire](unevaire.md) to the planet.

When [Unevaire](unevaire.md) is near, magical potency is heightened, allowing experienced practitioners to reach new heights. Additionally, someone born during this period is considerably more likely to have magical power.

When [Unevaire](unevaire.md) is distant, magical potency is diminished, causing spells to be less potent, or fail at random. During this time virtually no one is born with magical power.
