## Summary

Celanor is the only moon orbiting [Astarus](astarus.md). It is tidally locked to the planet, meaning the same side of the moon always points towards it.

White and small in comparison to [Astarus](astarus.md), Celanor orbits at a distance that makes it look small in the sky. A lunar phase cycle lasting just over a month can be observed, and a solar eclipse is possible.
