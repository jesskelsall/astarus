| **Type** | Planet |

## Summary

Astarus is the main planet that campaigns and oneshots take place on.

It is a small planet with a single moon, [Celanor](celanor.md). Originally populated by [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md), several migration events have brought disadvantaged and discriminated against races and cultures to Astarus, under the promise of a new beginning.

## Land

Astarus is dominated by [Kardan](../places/topography/continents-islands/kardan.md), the single continent that accounts for most of its land. It occupies roughly half of the planet's surface.

Due to a small axial tilt, Astarus has four distinct seasons. The winter cycle is particularly strongly felt in the northern reaches of [Kardan](../places/topography/continents-islands/kardan.md).

## Sky

The sky during the day and night is comparable to Earth's.

During the day the sky is blue, with orange and purple tones around sunrise and sunset. The sun is bright and yellow-white.

During the night the sky is dark blue or black, with visible stars, constellations, and faint traces of nebulae.

## Civilisations

The races of Astarus arrived or were created at different points in the planet's history by various [gods](../gods/gods.md):

| Event | God(s) | Race(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [The First Coming](../history/events/the-first-coming.md) | [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) | Dragon<br>Giant<br>Leonin<br>Minotaur<br>[Strigid](../lineages/strigid.md) |
| [The Second Coming](../history/events/the-second-coming.md) | [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) | Elf |
| [The Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md) | [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md)<br>[Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md)<br>[Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md)<br>[Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) | Dragonborn<br>Gnome<br>Goliath<br>Halfling<br>Human<br>Orc<br>Tabaxi<br>Tiefling<br>*(not exhaustive)* |

Following [the Second Coming](../history/events/the-second-coming.md) and [the Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md), various civilisations have emerged, each occupying their own portion of [Kardan](../places/topography/continents-islands/kardan.md) and the Kavallos Isles:

| Civilisation | Region |
| --- | --- |
| [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md) | Northern [Kardan](../places/topography/continents-islands/kardan.md) |
| [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) | Kavallos Isles |
| [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) | [Southeastern Kardan](../places/regions/southeastern-kardan.md) |
| [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) | Western [Kardan](../places/topography/continents-islands/kardan.md) |
| [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) | Southern [Kardan](../places/topography/continents-islands/kardan.md) |

## [Gods](../gods/gods.md)

Far outside of the reach of most [gods](../gods/gods.md), [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) has the strongest influence over Astarus. With the strength of his power over the world [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) created all plants and animals, as well as the first intelligent life.

Each of the other [gods](../gods/gods.md) with an eye on Astarus have found that their influence is minimal, to each of their surprise, and only after moving their followers there from [Oonar](oonar.md).

All of this contributes to a lack of evidence for the existence of [gods](../gods/gods.md) on Astarus. Those that believe in them do so through faith alone, with sporadic stories of divine influence treated with scepticism.

| God | Influence |
| --- | --- |
| [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) | Strong |
| [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) | Weak |
| [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md), [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md), [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md), [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) | Weak |

## Magic

*See: [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md)*

There is very little magic present on Astarus, and it is hard to harness.

[Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) infused his limited magic exclusively in dragons when populating the planet with life. The planet itself only gained magic with [the arrival](../history/events/the-third-coming.md) of [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) and [the Second Coming](../history/events/the-second-coming.md), which brought a small amount that is difficult to access.

As a result, each sentient creature born on Astarus has a 5% chance of possessing the ability to tap into the magic of Astarus. Those who are able to are revered or feared for their rare gift.

## History
