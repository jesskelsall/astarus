## Teachings

Gormox asks us to embrace our primal instincts and play “survival of the fittest” - there is no point in trying to fight this nature with civilised manners. His followers are warriors and revel in the glory of battle, are often selfish, and are opportunistic.

## Imagery

### Symbol

His symbol is a brown triangle intersected from the middle of each side to the opposite corner. The line starts slightly outside of the side of the triangle. These intersecting lines are often represented by swords, with the end of each sword touching a corner of the triangle.

### Representation

He is represented by a brown panther, stalking its prey.
