# Kardan

Kardan is the name given to the main continent on which all [Astarus](../../README.md) [campaigns](../../../campaigns/README.md) begin.

## [South East Kardan](south-east-kardan.md)

The south east of Kardan is a temperate region that lends itself well to farming, with snow-capped mountains to its north and dense forests typically at their base. Between here and the sea lie fertile plains that are kept wet by the 4 rivers coming off the mountains, and the rain that falls when the clouds hit the mountains.

To its south west is the [Sea of Songs](../sea-of-songs.md), which contains the island of Kardanis.

The entire south east is controlled by the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/README.md).

## South Kardan

The south of Kardan is a semi-arid region with sharp mountains, lush river valleys, and desert terrain. Life here is concentrated around the sea and rivers due to the harsh conditions.

The entire south is controlled by the [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/README.md).
