## Summary

Zenith Spire is the administrative building in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) in [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md). It is the seat of power for not only the [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) [Astorrel](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md), but also the [Astorrel](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) as a whole.

[Levelle Tristwix](../../people/levelle-tristwix.md), the [Astorrel Commandant](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/8-commandant.md), lives and works here. Other [Astorrel](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) involved directly in management of the organisation work here. The building therefore has its own security. Anyone not known to work within is not allowed inside without specific business and an invite.

It is a white marble spire-shaped building, rising 5 storeys above the city, making it the second tallest building in [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md). As it ascends its shape becomes a point, ending with a church-like tower spire. Along the way there are smaller decorative spires and intricate carvings in the marble.
