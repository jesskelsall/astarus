## Summary

Grizgrep Reagents & Magical Curios is a shop that specialises in selling magical reagents needed for spell material components. It is located on [Crafters Course](crafters-course.md) in the [Sunset District](sunset-district.md) of [Northhaven](../README.md).

A delicately decorated sign hangs above the shop, taking up its entire length. There is also a folding chalkboard that lists a bunch of magical components in different coloured chalks:

- Sulfur
- Grasshopper legs
- Holy water
- Silver wire
- Legume seeds

Inside are large barrels of components, each containing ladles for measuring quantities. At the back is a counter with several sets of scales. The room is garishly decorated in paneling painted in clashing colours.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Clashing coloured stripes on the walls and floor. Large wooden barrels filled with reagents. A bench on the right side of the room containing smaller vessels of components. A wooden counter at the back for weighing and sales. Several intricate scales of varying sizes and tolerances. |
| Sounds | Various components being rummaged through. Jars opening and closing. |
| Smells | A mix of everything in the room. Switches between pleasant and putrid with each breath. |
| People | Few [magicborn](../../../magicborn.md) citizens browsing. |
| Intrigue | The store has been made to be as eye-catching as possible with no regard for how the elusive [magicborn](../../../magicborn.md) customers would feel about it. |
