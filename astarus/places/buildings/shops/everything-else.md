## Summary

Everything Else is a general store on [Crafters Course](../../streets/crafters-course.md) in the [Sunset District](../../districts/sunset-district.md) of [Northhaven](../../cities/northhaven.md).

It caters to those who need standard survival equipment and provisions. If you can't find it somewhere else, this is the next place to try.

The store has a standard appearance with a simple swinging sign outside and two large windows either side of the door. The store is laid out with shelves, barrels and buckets of products, neatly stacked and sensibly arranged.

By the entrance is a counter area from which [Nilus Cray](../../../people/nilus-cray.md) watches people enter and leave, as well as people watch through the window.

### [Astorrel Agents](../../../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/README.md)

On graduation day the store is busier than usual, but [Nilus Cray](../../../people/nilus-cray.md) has stocked well and isn't worried. His monotone speech and demeanour brings calm to an otherwise hectic day.
