## History

### [Astorrel Graduation](../../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/storylines/astorrel-graduation.md)

The [Astorrel Agents](../../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/README.md) party came here to meet [Bryce Morton](../../people/bryce-morton.md), their new superior officer. Here they became [Canary Squad](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md), alongside [Crimson Squad](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby.md).

From here on out, the party must return here to complete their missions and be given new ones.
