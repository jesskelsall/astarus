## Summary

The Mission's End is an inn inside of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) in [Northhaven](../../cities/northhaven.md).

It is a combination of an inn and a hostel, designed for [Astorrel](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) turning around between missions. It offers an all inclusive food, drink, and lodging package only, simplifying the inn process. Every room contains two bunk beds, meaning that those without a full party may have to share with strangers.

From the outside it resembles many of the other buildings in [Northhaven](../../cities/northhaven.md): built of polished stone and decorated in marble. It has marble pillars surrounding its outside, connected to a sloped roof around its edges. The building is long and wide, with a square courtyard in its center accessible from the hallways that border it.

Inside the entryway is a large canteen-like room that takes up half of the ground floor. There is a kitchen hatch where meals are served at all hours, and rows of benches & tables to sit at.

Payment is taken at the doorway and a room key is given. This is then presented to reenter the building without having to pay again. Each room has four identical keys, one for each person staying in it.

## History

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/README.md)

Prior to session 1, the party has (individually) been staying in The Mission's End since arriving in [Northhaven](../../cities/northhaven.md) 1-4 days ago. They have not been allowed to leave the building until the graduation ceremonies began.

Following graduation, the party will need to pay again to reenter the building and use its premises.
