## Summary

The Rose Buckler is an inn in the [Sunset District](../../districts/sunset-district.md) of [Northhaven](../../cities/northhaven.md). It is ran by the innkeeper, [Tydrus Tinshield](../../../people/tydrus-tinshield.md).

It styles itself as a traditional run-of-the-mill inn. Despite a predominantly stone exterior with many segmented windows, its swinging sign and interior resembles a standard cobble stone and wooden tavern. Despite the rustic aesthetic, the building quality is noticeably higher than most taverns, giving it the appearance of a strange knock-off.

Due to its proximity to the [Northhaven Astornox Stronghold](../../strongholds/northhaven-astornox-stronghold.md), it is popular with [Astornox](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md), both active and retired. As a result it has a reputation for hard drinkers and unruly, if not friendly, behaviour by its patrons. It has one of the finest selection of ales in [Northhaven](../../cities/northhaven.md), and lodging is cheap and cheerful.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Plain stone exterior with many segmented windows. Four floors. Wood and wrought iron swinging sign. Inside is decorated like a typical cobble stone and wooden tavern. Building work is of higher quality, giving a somewhat fake vibe. |
| Sounds | Loud chatter, wooden mugs being slammed and hit together. Periodic shouts and cheers. |
| Smells | Strong smell of ale and body odour. Wet wood. Wet dog. |
| People | [Astornox](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) citizens, other rough and tumble citizens. Plainer looking people. |
| Intrigue | The [Sunset District](../../districts/sunset-district.md) is so affluent that a cheap and cheerful inn experience is a sought after curiosity. |

## History

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/README.md)

During graduation day the inn is busier than usual due to [The Mission's End](the-missions-end.md) being packed with graduates. By that evening, it is back to its normal level.
