## Summary

Northern Astor is much like [Central Astor](central-astor.md) - full of grassy plains and flanked by the forests and mountains. The [Northern Road](../roads/northern-road.md) provides travelers and goods to and from the [Dardenn Kingdom](../../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/README.md) to the far north. Some of the best agriculture and industry can be found here, particularly around [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) and Iredale.
