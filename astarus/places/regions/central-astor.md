## Summary

Central Astor is the heartland of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/README.md). It is where the majority of the kingdom's population lives, largely due to its flat plains and fertile rivers. Between the settlements are countless fields producing an abundance of food for the populace.

The land is only broken up by Duskmere, the large lake that [Northhaven](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/README.md) is built next to, the river Humar estuary, Walna Pike, and Walna Forest. These make journeys to the coast or into western Astor less direct.

The Great Astor Road cuts east to west connecting central Astor to both the east and west edges of the kingdom. From Eaglesfield the Northern Road takes travelers into northern Astor and beyond to the [Dardenn Kingdom](../../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/README.md).

To the kingdom's western most reaches is territory that is still classified as part of central Astor. This includes the Albulain Valley, where the [Cepine](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/ethnicities/cepine.md) people reside. It borders the Neum Flats, a desolate tract of wastes that precedes the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/README.md) to the far west.
