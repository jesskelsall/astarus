## Summary

Astor's eastern coast is dominated by rough hills and steep cliffs, making travel off the Great Astor Road treacherous. What little usable land there is is squeezed between the [Sea of Songs](../sea-of-songs.md) and the Knock Peaks. The fishing port of [Dunmore](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/dunmore.md) dominates this region.
