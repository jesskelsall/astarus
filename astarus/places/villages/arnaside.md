## Summary

Arnaside is a village on the coast of the [Sea of Songs](../seas/sea-of-songs.md), near to where [Walna Forest](../forests/walna-forest.md) meets the sea.

The village was founded 15 years ago and has a small but closely knit population. The villagers chose to move here to pursue a self-sufficient lifestyle in service to [Malnesh](../../gods/gods/malnesh.md). What they can't grow or make themselves, they buy with the money made from exporting wood from their logging camp.
