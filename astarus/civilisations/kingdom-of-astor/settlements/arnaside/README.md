## Summary

Arnaside is a village on the coast of the [Sea of Songs](../../../../geography/sea-of-songs.md), near to where Walna Forest meets the [Sea of Songs](../../../../geography/sea-of-songs.md).

The village was founded 15 years ago and has a small population. Their primary export is wood logged from the edge of Walna Forest. There is also some beach fishing done here, but the cliffs near town makes starting a harbour difficult.
