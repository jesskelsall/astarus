## Summary

Mockerkin is a town in eastern Astor.

It is nestled near the base of the Bray mountains, which loom over it to the north. To the east is the river Esk, and to the west is the Braywood.

Despite the potentially idyllic setting, Mockerkin is a mining town which makes its money from mining precious metals, gems, and marble, all of which are exported down the river to [Eskrigg](eskrigg.md), or further to [Northhaven](northhaven/README.md) via the [Sea of Songs](../../../geography/sea-of-songs.md) and the river Humar.

There is an active pit fighting scene in Mockerkin, giving the workers an opportunity to show off their strength cultivated in the mines and blow off some steam. As a result, pit fighters from Mockerkin are held in the highest regard.
