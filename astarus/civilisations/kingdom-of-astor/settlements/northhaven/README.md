## Summary

Northhaven is the capital city of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../README.md) and its largest city. It is located on the eastern shore of Duskmere in Central Astor.

Located on flat plains on the shore of Duskmere, Northhaven can be seen from far away, dominating the landscape. The city core is surrounded by a crescent of large stone walls which stretch around the city and touch the lake at both ends.

Only military members are allowed within the walls, where marble and stone architecture is commonplace and the wealth of the kingdom is most on show. From here the military might of the kingdom is wielded.

Outside of the walls is a comparably sized urban sprawl, where the drigg of the city live. This is typically medieval styled stone and wood buildings, though more urban due to the city's size. The bulk of the population lives here, with exceptional craftspeople and traders allowing the city beyond the wall to thrive.
