## Summary

The Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold is the home of the [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md) in [Northhaven](../README.md). Aside from its normal duties as a home for the [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md) in this region, and from which they operate out into central and western Astor, [Levelle Tristwix](../../../../../people/levelle-tristwix.md), the [Astorrel Commandant](../../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/7-commandant.md), resides here.

This is the biggest [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md) stronghold in the kingdom, and by far the richest. Like much of the [Sunset District](sunset-district.md) surrounding it, it is constructed of the finest marble and stone available, and the [Astorrel members](../../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/1-member.md) that call it home are amongst some of the most privileged people in all of the land.

### Surrounding Wall

A large stone wall surrounds the stronghold. It is two storeys tall and is pointed rather than having straight sides, its cross section resembling an elongated pyramid. It is curious to behold. With no guard towers around its perimeter, many wonder if it's more for show than protection.

There is one entrance to the stronghold, one street away from [Astor Square](astor-square.md) ([Kirrel](../../../../../gods/gods/kirrel.md) Way). It has an entryway arch that is surrounded by a larger structure with pointed towers on both of its ends. Once again there are no guards above ground level.

In order to enter, [Northhaven](../README.md) [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md) check your badge using a magical cantrip. This allows them to verify who you say you are. This is a more stringent checkpoint than on [Northhaven Wall](northhaven-wall.md).

Within 20ft of the entryway there is an anti-magic field that renders any magic inside of it useless. Magical properties return once the area is left. This helps protect against any form of magical subversion including disguises and invisibility.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Two storey wall with slightly sloped sides, coming to a point at the top. Featureless and without guard posts or towers. Entryway: tall plain gatehouse with pointed towers on each side. [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md) guards checking people who wish to enter. |
| Sounds | Foot traffic, chatter, guards talking to [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md). |
| Smells | Typical affluent city smells. |
| People | [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md), [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md) guards on duty. |
| Intrigue | The wall and its guardhouse seem undefended. Is this wall here symbolically or is there more than meets the eye? |

### Inside

Inside the stronghold is a small selection of buildings, somewhat tightly arranged to make best use of the space afforded to the [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md). Each is immaculately kept and well decorated. Like the [Sunset District](sunset-district.md), the buildings here are made of marble and polished stone. There is no wood to be seen on any building exterior.

A main street, [Kirrel](../../../../../gods/gods/kirrel.md) Way, leads through the stronghold to its other end, giving way to a small square with a fountain of [Kirrel](../../../../../gods/gods/kirrel.md) - a snake decorated in their colours. From here the main administrative buildings can be found.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | An immaculate street penned in by large multi-storey buildings of marble and stone. Exquisite decorations. Banners and potted flowers. A small city within a city. |
| Sounds | [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md) chatting as they go about their business. Footsteps. Birdsong. |
| Smells | Flowers, bread baking, affluent city smell. |
| People | [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md) of all shapes and sizes. Everyone wearing a military badge. |
| Intrigue | A haven even within the [Sunset District](sunset-district.md), this is likely the most affluent place in all of [Northhaven](../README.md). |
