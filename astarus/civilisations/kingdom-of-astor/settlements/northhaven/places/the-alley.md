## Summary

The Alley is a tea shop located around the edge of [Astor Square](astor-square.md), in [Northhaven](../README.md)'s [Sunset District](sunset-district.md). It is an upmarket tea shop that specialises in brewing tea for customers.

Though tea shops are common in the real world, tea itself is rather new to the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../README.md). It originates from the warmer climates of South [Kardan](../../../../../geography/kardan/README.md), where the [Syntenne Republic](../../../../syntenne-republic/README.md) is based. Here tea is enjoyed more widely. The dried leaves started initially being sold as enemy contraband before it became accepted in [Northhaven](../README.md).

The name "The Alley" is a reference to the contraband roots of tea in [Northhaven](../README.md). The tea shop is extremely fancy, cultivating an atmosphere of luxury and calmness for its patrons. This is the place to be if you can afford it.

### Exterior

The building appears quaint from the outside, using marble and polished stone to create a refined, patterned, and sumptuously decorated facade that resembles a three storey townhouse.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Three storey townhouse with segmented windows. Flower planters below each window. Marble and polished stone, with detailed carvings and decorations adorning the facade. Beautiful wooden door with interleaved metals. Wood and iron swinging sign with the business name in cursive. Either a line of wealthy citizens waiting to get in, or less wealthy citizens looking through the windows curiously from a distance. |
| Sounds | Quiet chatter. Cello and violin from inside. |
| Smells | Sweet floral fragrances, pastries and cakes. Flowers from the window planters and from within. |
| People | The wealthiest citizens in [Northhaven](../README.md), dressed in their finest clothes. |
| Intrigue | This place is incredibly posh. A rare foreign delicacy being enjoyed by those who can afford it. |

## Interior

Inside the building is split over three floors. At the entrance is a counter where a waiter takes your order. You pay and are then seated on one of the floors. On the ground floor, the tea is brewed and the food is prepared in a small room, out of sight of the patrons.

A cellist and violinist play gentle notes on the middle floor, entertaining the guests while they enjoy their food, drink, and quiet conversation.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Intricate marble and stone interior to match the exterior. Small handcrafted wooden tables and chairs with metal decoration. Bouquets of flowers, paintings and small sculptures on pedestals. Marble counter on the ground floor for giving dishes to the waiters. Back room where preparation is done. Small area on middle floor for musical performances. |
| Sounds | Cello and violin playing gently. Polite chatter across tables. Clinking of cups on saucers, knives on plates. |
| Smells | Tea with floral notes. Flowers from within. Faint smell of pastries baking. |
| People | 2 wait staff in formal wear. Aristocratic citizens enjoying themselves blissfully. |
| Intrigue | This is a paradise for those who enjoy fine experiences, but it is incredibly poncy and completely unaware. |
