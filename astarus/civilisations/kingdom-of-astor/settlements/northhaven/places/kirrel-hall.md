## Summary

Kirrel Hall is a banquet hall in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) in [Northhaven](../README.md).

It is a general meeting place used for ceremonies, hosting distinguished guests, feasts and celebrations, and general socialising. In the summer months it sees little use outside of ceremonies and festivals, but in the winter months it is transformed into a warm communal gathering place.

It resembles a church or cathedral in design - one long tall chamber supported by pillars on either sides, with a vaulted roof. The interior is built with white marble pillars and decorations. It has a sloped roof and stained glass windows.

The entrance is on its side near the end. When entering, the room opens out to the left.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Stone church-like exterior with stained glass windows, sloped roof, and decorative embellishments. Inside is decorated in white marble. Large pillars run the length of the hall, holding the vaulted roof up. Polished stone floor. Marble decoration. |
| Sounds | Echoing footsteps. |
| Smells | Candle wax, dust. |
| People | [Astorrel Members](../../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/1-member.md) preparing the hall for its next use, or cleaning up. |
| Intrigue | The hall shows a strong sense of community within the [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md), and almost appears to be a form of self-worship. |

## History

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../../../../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/README.md)

On graduation day, this is the venue used for graduation ceremonies. The inside of the hall is decked out in banners featuring the [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md) and [Kirrel](../../../../../gods/gods/kirrel.md) symbols. A stage is set up on the far end.

#### Graduation Speeches

Those speaking are present on the stage while all of the graduates stand lined up in the center of the hall. Other [Astorrel](../../../organisations/astorrel/README.md) who are observing watch from the sides. This is demarcated by the pillars.

#### Graduation Presentation

Those making the presentations stand on stage and call each person up, alphabetically. Steps at each side of the stage allow graduates to approach from stage left and exit via stage right.

#### Command Assignments

Once the graduation presentation is over, a board is revealed near the entrance, on the far side of the room. This contains each person's assignment.

#### Following Graduation

The building is closed while the graduation setup is torn down. It remains closed for all of session 1.
