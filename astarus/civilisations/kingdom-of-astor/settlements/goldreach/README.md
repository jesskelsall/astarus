## Summary

Goldreach is a town in northern Astor. It is the northernmost settlement along the Northern Road, and the last before entering the [Dardenn Kingdom](../../../dardenn-kingdom/README.md).

The quaint rural town is set amongst expansive grassy plains, penned in by the Hawkswood to the west and the Winster Forest to the east, with views of the mountains to the north providing a dramatic backdrop.

Built on a natural spring in the plains, Goldreach is not walled and rarely in any danger due to the amicable relationship with the [Dardenn Kingdom](../../../dardenn-kingdom/README.md) to the north. It is built around a Marketplace and features an Order of the Diamond temple, an [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox.md) stronghold with an outer wall, lively shops and a few notable inns.

It is known for its cosmopolitan residents, bustling trade, and general good hospitality, making it a favourite rest stop for frequent travelers. There are many farms in the vicinity, so it is an agricultural hub with much food and animals passing through it.

| Smells | Mud, horse manure, livestock, ale. |
| People | Cosmopolitan mix of people of all races and levels of the social order. [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox.md) stronghold, well off citizens. |
