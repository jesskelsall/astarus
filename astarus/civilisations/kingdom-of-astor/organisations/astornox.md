TODO:

The Astornox is the main institution in the kingdom. Everyone from the lowliest soldier to those just below the generals of the [Astornar](astornar.md) are typically members of the Astornox.

There is a rigid command structure, explicit orders given, and an expectation of complete loyalty above all else.

The Astornox operate out of their own buildings, often in areas sectioned off from everyone else.

The symbol of the Astornox is that of the [Kingdom of Astor](../README.md), set inside a grey triangle, face up. Medium to high ranking members wear a pin just like the [Astornar](astornar.md) do, but it is not typically seen on lower ranking members due to cost.
