## Summary

[Players Squad](../squads/players.md) is tasked with traveling to [Arnaside](../../../settlements/arnaside/README.md) and checking the status of the logging operations going on at the edge of Walna Forest.

Ensure that logging operations are proceeding as normal. Prevent over-logging or anything that is slowing logging down. If the locals are over-logging and won't listen, report back who they are so they can be punished.
