# Duties

Astorrel Majors are specialised leaders that oversee a facet of the [Astorrel](../README.md). They have multiple [Astorrel Lieutenants](5-lieutenant.md) working for them to achieve their goals.

Majors have varied responsibilities:

- Broad decisions on how to look after the balance of nature and civilisation (which informs the missions that Lieutenants create).
- Training new recruits through the [Astorrel](../README.md) training programme (their Lieutenants are mentors to the trainees).
- Other new initiatives regarding unknown phenomena and potential threats.
