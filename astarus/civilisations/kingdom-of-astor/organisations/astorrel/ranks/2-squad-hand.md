# Military Badge

*See also: [Military badges](../../../military-badges.md)*

Astorrel Squad Hand badges look like plain [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) [military badges](../../../military-badges.md), but with a strip of silver inlaid inside its bottom edge.

# Duties

Astorrel Squad Hands make up 3 of the 4 members of a mission squad, the fourth being [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) Squad Leader.

Their duties are to complete missions given to them by their Squad Sergeant, and lead by their Squad Lead. This sees them traveling to locations within the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../README.md), talking with locals, seeing the state of the land, and taking action on their Squad Lead's behalf.

Squads are based out of the city that their Squad Sergeant resides in, and so it is typical that they complete missions in the surrounding area.

# Pay

Squad Hands are paid per mission, by their Squad Sergeant. Each Squad Hand in a squad receives equal pay for a mission, but an [Astorrel Squad Lead](3-squad-lead.md) always receives more.

As their Squad Sergeant determines how much of the mission bounty to give to the squad, and not all missions pay the same, a Squad Hand's pay can vary mission-to-mission, and is not always comparable to other squads.

# Promotion

In squads without an established Squad Lead, there is opportunity for promotion to [Astorrel Squad Lead](3-squad-lead.md).

By distinguishing themselves on missions and by earning the favour of their [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](4-squad-sergeant.md), a Squad Hand can be promoted to Squad Lead - typically over their existing squad. Which Squad Hand gets promoted is at the Squad Sergeant's discretion.

During a period where a squad has no Squad Lead, the Squad Sergeant may make a Squad Hand an acting Squad Lead in order to test their aptitude for the role.

Once a Squad Hand is part of a squad with a Squad Lead, the opportunity for promotion only arises again if they are shuffled into a squad with no Squad Lead. This can be done by Squad Sergeants with multiple squads if deemed necessary. Most often this happens when a Squad Hand or Squad Lead retires, or dies.
