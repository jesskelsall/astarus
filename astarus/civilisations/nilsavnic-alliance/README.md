## Summary

The Nil'Savnic Alliance is a collection of city states in Eastern [Kardan](../../geography/kardan/README.md) that have formed a rough alliance in response to the existence of their neighbouring kingdoms.

This is where many of the lesser races of [Kardan](../../geography/kardan/README.md) originate from.
