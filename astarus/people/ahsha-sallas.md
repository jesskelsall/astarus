## Summary

Ahsha Sallas is a player character in the [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/README.md) campaign, played by Billie.

## Backstory

Ahsha Sallas was born in the town of [Mockerkin](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/mockerkin.md) to [Arsha Sallas](arsha-sallas.md) (orc father) and [Felina Sallas](felina-sallas.md) (human mother).

As a child she was aware of the differences in how people treated her drigg mother compared to her citizen (ex-[Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md)) father, which triggered a powerful instinct to protect her mother. As a result she got into a lot of fights at a young age. She would start a fight before talking it over, earning her a reputation as a hot-head.

While heading for trouble as a teen, Ahsha was picked up by [Barthon Ironfist](barthon-ironfist.md) who began training her for the world of pit fighting. She was sad to have to leave home, but the nearest pit fighting ring was in the city of [Eskrigg](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/eskrigg.md), a 1 to 2 day journey from [Mockerkin](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/mockerkin.md). She was able to return home for holidays.

Ahsha honed her skills in [Eskrigg](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/eskrigg.md) and gained some notoriety and fame as a force to be reckoned with.

After a few years she was spotted by [Jorren Grieger](jorren-grieger.md), an [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) scout who came to watch one of her fights. He encouraged Ahsha to apply for the [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md). As his mother had once tried to join but failed during training, it has been a huge goal of hers to succeed where her mother could not.

During her [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) training in [Dunmore](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/dunmore.md), Ahsha earned some respect despite her reputation as an argumentative fighter. At one point she got into a fight with one of her mentors, [Kael Greenknee](kael-greenknee.md). After this was settled, she was treated with respect and favour amongst the mentors.

In her spare time she likes to read the Dwarves at Sea novels and sing orcish battle shanties.
