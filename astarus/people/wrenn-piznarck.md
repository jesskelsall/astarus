## History

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) Prelude

#### The Carnmere Meteorite

Prior to the campaign, Wrenn traveled to Carnmere to search for the Carnmere Meteorite. Here, without the knowledge of the rest of [Astral Squad](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/astral.md), he hired [The Crimson Blades](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) to retrieve the meteorite for him, offering to pay them more substantially when they returned with it.

After not hearing from them for 3 days, Wrenn got cold feet and left Carnmere for [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), believing that the mercenary group had simply pocketed his deposit and left. He returned to [Astral Squad](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/astral.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) empty-handed.
