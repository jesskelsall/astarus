## Summary

She is a politically savvy commandant who is a big believer in the [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md).

### [Astorrel Graduation](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/storylines/astorrel-graduation.md)

Levelle Tristwix conducted the graduation of the [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/README.md) party, alongside [Merkin Thorgus](merkin-thorgus.md). They pinned each [Astorrel Squad Hand](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/2-squad-hand.md) badge on the party members, and shook their hand.

After the graduation presentation, Levelle caught up with [Grant Thackeray](grant-thackeray.md). Together they said hi to [Redwyn Humpledopper](redywn-humpledopper.md), who ignored Levelle.
