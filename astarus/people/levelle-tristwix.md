## Summary

Levelle Tristwix is the [Astorrel Commandant](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/8-commandant.md) in charge of the organisation's day-to-day operations.

She is a politically savvy commandant who is a big believer in the [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Despite her slow and posh manner of speaking, she easily commands a room. She'd like to see less conflict with the [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

## History

While a Squad Lead, her squad was called **Acre Squad**. [Grant Thackeray](grant-thackeray.md) was a Squad Hand in this squad. They remain old friends to this day.

### [Astorrel Graduation](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/storylines/astorrel-graduation.md)

Levelle Tristwix conducted the graduation of the [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/astorrel-agents.md) party, alongside [Mergin Thorgus](mergin-thorgus.md). They pinned each [Astorrel Squad Hand](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/2-squad-hand.md) badge on the party members, and shook their hand.

After the graduation presentation, Levelle caught up with [Grant Thackeray](grant-thackeray.md). Together they said hi to [Redwyn Humpledopper](redywn-humpledopper.md), who ignored Levelle.

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md)

Levelle visits the party in [sanctuary](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) early in the morning after they arrive in the night. They inform them that she has already heard from her [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) counterpart, TODO [ASTORNOX COMMANDANT](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/ranks/7-commandant.md), that 2 guards and 1 [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter ([Vilnia Kovas](vilnia-kovas.md)) were killed as they made their way through [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md).

They are furious at them, largely as their presence in the stronghold will inflame tensions between the [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). They want to know what their redeeming qualities are or they're happy for them to be spat back out into the [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md)'s clutches when [sanctuary](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) is rescinded.

- Meteoric threat: Levelle starts looking into what's going on.
- Firbolg controversy: Levelle leans towards naturist views if [Wizira](wizira.md) opens up.

Later Levelle will return with [Mindira Flibfae](mindira-flipfae.md) when the [Astornar](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornar.md) announce that [the firbolg controversy](../../campaigns/purple-rain/storylines/the-firbolg-controversy.md) will be coming to trial. They come to learn what they can from [Wizira](wizira.md) about [Wizira's Father](wiziras-father.md)'s situation so that they can use it in evidence in the trial. The rest of the party may also be useful depending on what information they volunteer.
