## Summary

Barthon Ironfist is a dwarf involved in the pit fighting scene in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md). Previously a pit fighter himself, he retired to find and train the next generation of fighters to make his fortune.

He found [Ahsha Sallas](ahsha-sallas.md) in [Mockerkin](../places/towns/mockerkin.md), fighting (and winning) against anyone who got in her way, and offered to take her to [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) where she would become a pit fighter.

Barthon spent several years training Ahsha in the ways of pit fighting, particularly fist fighting, his specialty.

They parted ways when Ahsha decided to join the [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) recruitment programme.
