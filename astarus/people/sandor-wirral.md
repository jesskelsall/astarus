## History

### [Astorrel Graduation](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/storylines/astorrel-graduation.md)

On graduation day, the [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/astorrel-agents.md) party shopped in [S.Q. Wirral & Son](../places/buildings/shops/sq-wirral-and-son.md). [Ahsha Sallas](ahsha-sallas.md) and Whisper of the Wind both bought armour from him.

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/astorrel-agents.md)

On graduation day, Sandor Wirral is calm in the face of lots of new customers. He is just happy that they've chosen his business.
