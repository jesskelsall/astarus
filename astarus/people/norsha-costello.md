## History

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md)

Norsha visits the party in [sanctuary](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) with [Carras Southroot](carras-southroot.md), who they force to come with them. They wish to confront Carras with the gravity of what their negligence has caused, and holds him responsible for retrieving [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md).

Norsha themself wishes to learn what Wrenn was doing away from [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) in the first place, unaware of what [Astral squad](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/astral.md) has really been up to.
