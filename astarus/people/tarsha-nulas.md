## Summary

TODO

Was an [Astorrel member](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/1-member.md), didn't get to see the kingdom first-hand. Living through books and stories now.

Tarsha Nulas is the owner of the [Friend of the Magicborn](../places/buildings/shops/friend-of-the-magicborn.md) magical items shop.

She is a confident, stern and mysterious woman that speaks somewhat evasively. Her instinct is to trust no-one, and so she judges harshly and watches carefully. She never leaves the counter while someone is in her store.

## History

Tarsha Nulas is secretly a member of the [Astornar](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornar.md), tasked by the generals with running the [Friend of the Magicborn](../places/buildings/shops/friend-of-the-magicborn.md) store. The purpose of the store is to provide a check on the magical items coming through [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) and in circulation in the kingdom as a whole.

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/README.md)

On graduation day, Tarsha Nulas is present at her shop counter constantly. She answers questions calmly but evasively, giving very little hard details about what services cost or what items might be available.

Any [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) when asked would know that she is typically distrustful of those who have not proven themselves. She becomes much less opaque when sold a magical item.
