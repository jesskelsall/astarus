## Summary

Darius Dunn is a new Squad Hand in the [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md), and is part of [Ruby Squad](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby.md).

Born into the family of a city captain, Darius' mother's fire elemental lineage caused problems when their child was born with red skin. Shunned by his parents, Darius spent his youth reading books and wishing for a fairer world with less war and conflict. After discovering his magical powers at the age of 15, he entered into the [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) recruitment programme to escape his home life, graduating after only two years.
