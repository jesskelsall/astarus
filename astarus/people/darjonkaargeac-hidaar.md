## History

Hidaar and [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md) have known each other for years. Both [Astral Squad](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/astral.md) and [Goshawk Squad](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md) have worked alongside each other before, giving them a chance to become friends.

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md)

Hidaar sent his squad out in search of a blue firbolg and a grey skinned human after receiving two messages from [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md) using Sending:

> Help! Captured by bandits. Please help my friends! Hunted by [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md). They know information that will save Astor. Get them to Elysia!

> Captured near [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md). Heading to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) by boat or road. Blue firbolg, grey human--

He ordered his squad hands as follows:

| Character | Order |
| --- | --- |
| [Emi Rulsay](emi-rulsay.md) | Direct to [Beckermet](../places/towns/beckermet.md) via the plains. |
| [Sarleen Truestriker](sarleen-truestriker.md) | Along the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) to [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md). |
| [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) | Up the [Humar Cut](../places/roads/humar-cut.md) to [Howbridge](../places/towns/howbridge.md). |

If they didn't find anything, they were to meet him back at [Goshawk Squad](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md) House in [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md).

Hidaar didn't tell his squad that Wrenn believes the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party have information that "will save Astor".

He is very glad to see the party and is very accommodating. He is forthright with what he knows and wants to know what information the party has so he can figure out how to proceed.

He can tell the party about:
- [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md)
- Sanctuary
- [Astornar](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornar.md) trial (light on specifics)
- Firbolg controversy

Once his squad reassembles, he issues the following orders:

| Character | Order |
| --- | --- |
| [Emi Rulsay](emi-rulsay.md) | Stay here with him to run interference on the [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md). |
| [Sarleen Truestriker](sarleen-truestriker.md) | Attempt to contact [Levelle Tristwix](levelle-tristwix.md). |
| [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) | Accompany the party into [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). |
