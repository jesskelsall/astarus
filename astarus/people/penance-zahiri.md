## History

### Backstory

Penance grew up on the streets of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), stealing and starting fights. Eventually their reputation allowed them to take a position as a smuggler moving contraband in and out of the city - most notably [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) children. Penance claims that one night they were visited by [Bhygar](../gods/gods/bhygar.md) who gave them their powers and instructed them to live their life more fully, and inspire others to do the same. They changed their name and applied to the [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) recruitment programme at age 19, honing their paladin powers as they trained.

### [Two Truths and a Lie](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/two-truths-and-a-lie.md)

- They were a criminal prior to training as an [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). [truth]
- Penance hasn't always been their name. [truth]
- They are originally from outside the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/README.md). [lie]

### [Astorrel Graduation](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/storylines/astorrel-graduation.md)

The [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/astorrel-agents.md) party has seen Penance in [Bryce Morton's Office](../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md) when they were placed in [Crimson Squad](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby.md). When [Bryce Morton](bryce-morton.md) left the room to retrieve the maps, they failed to get [Tabari Se](tabari-se.md) to say something.
