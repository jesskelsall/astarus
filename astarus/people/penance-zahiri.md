## Summary

Penance Zahiri is a new Squad Hand in the Astorrel, and is part of Ruby Squad.

Penance grew up on the streets of Newhaven, stealing and starting fights. Eventually their reputation allowed them to take a position as a smuggler moving contraband in and out of the city - most notably magicborn children. Penance claims that one night they were visited by Bhygar who gave them their powers and instructed them to live their life more fully, and inspire others to do the same. They changed their name and applied to the Astorrel recruitment programme at age 19, honing their paladin powers as they trained.
