## Summary

Adalie Seren is [Ephaine Seren](ephaine-seren.md)'s mother. She lives in the village of Filisur with her husband, [Schaef Seren](schaef-seren.md), and her children.

## History

When [Ephaine Seren](ephaine-seren.md) was 15, during a particularly tough winter in which the [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) garrison were forced to overwinter due to the sudden arrival of the late autumn snow, [Tamman Seren](tamman-seren.md) stood up to an [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) commander and his vanguard who came for his family's sheep in the night.

Tamman was severely beaten for his insolence. During this developing situation, [Ephaine Seren](ephaine-seren.md) caused an avalanche that buried and killed the [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) still present outside their home.

In the following aftermath, Adalie helped quickly prepare provisions for Ephaine as she fled home, seeking the [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) for sanctuary.
