## Summary

Alistair Hawthorn is the [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) Captain of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md). He is the commanding officer there, overseeing the protection of the town and the use of its standing military presence.

He comes from a prestigious family and is the embodiment of the upper class in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), ruling through rank and reputation alike.

## History

When he was younger, Alistair was stationed in Kilflynn with [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md). It was here that they became good friends.

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/README.md) Prelude

*See: [Finding the Goldreach Meteorite](../../campaigns/purple-rain/storylines.md/finding-the-goldreach-meteorite.md)*

Following the impact of the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite, Alistair saw an influx of people into [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md). This put him on edge as more people typically means more trouble.

Not long after, his friend [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md) arrived in the town from [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) to investigate the meteorite. He agreed to host him in his home while he had business in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md).

### [PR1](../../campaigns/purple-rain/sessions.md/1.md)

*See: [Finding the Goldreach Meteorite](../../campaigns/purple-rain/storylines.md/finding-the-goldreach-meteorite.md)*

Alistair entered [The Slippery Weasel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/the-slippery-weasel.md) and gave a speech to the room, making it clear that the presence of [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) would not be tolerated, and they would be found. After this he went table to table asking people about their business. This included the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/README.md) party. Alistair was satisfied with their answers and left them alone.

Following [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md)'s conversation with the party here, Wrenn pointed to the table to show Alistair the group that had agreed to work with him, before they left the inn together.

### [PR3](../../campaigns/purple-rain/sessions.md/3.md)

*See: [Wolves Threaten Goldreach](../../campaigns/purple-rain/storylines.md/wolves-threaten-goldreach.md)*

When the remains of the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) wolf pack charge into town in the early morning out of fear, Alistair is on patrol with some [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) guards. He is able to defeat part of the pack and their dire wolf leader while the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/README.md) party fights and kills other wolves further up the street.

In the aftermath, he thanks for the party for their hard work and offers to reward them if they visit him at the [Goldreach Astornox Stronghold](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-astornox-stronghold.md) the following day, giving him enough time to help clean up the mess and see that the wounded are taken care of.

The party never took him up on this offer due to the following events that transpired.

### [PR6](../../campaigns/purple-rain/sessions.md/6.md)

Around the time of this [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/README.md) session, [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md) was caught looking through the [Goldreach Astornox Stronghold](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-astornox-stronghold.md) for [Wizira](wizira.md)'s Father, or any evidence that he was once here. When confronted by Alistair, Wrenn accidentally admitted to knowing [Wizira](wizira.md), effectively admitting to harbouring [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md).

Alistair gave Wrenn an ultimatum: turn the party over to Alistair upon their return or face serious punishment (likely death). He agreed, but later reneged, recruiting meteorite adventurers to find the party with the help of his crow familiar, and went into hiding in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md).

### [PR9](../../campaigns/purple-rain/sessions.md/9.md)

TODO confirm session number

While the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain/README.md) party was escaping [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) with [Wrenn Piznarck](wrenn-piznarck.md), Alistair Hawthorn was personally commanding the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md)'s search efforts for him throughout town, despite it being the middle of the night. He was furious at his former friend's betrayal, and insisted they try harder to find Wrenn before raising the alarm to the Eaglesfield and [Beckermet](../places/towns/beckermet.md) [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md).
