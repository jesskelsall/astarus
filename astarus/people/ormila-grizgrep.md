## History

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/README.md)

On graduation day, Ormila Grizgrep spends the busiest part of the day stood outside of her store shouting into the street, trying to entice [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) into her store.

When one finally bites, she goes back inside and tries to make friends with them. She is very keen to get to know her new potential recurring customers.
