## Summary

Zarrus Maleron is the innkeeper at the [Valley Under the Stars](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/valley-under-the-stars.md) in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). He works for [Cara Treffen](cara-treffen.md), the owner.

Zarrus is polite but eccentric, providing a unique social interaction to the guests of the inn - one which they typically welcome. He speaks with odd inflection and describes things in a roundabout manner.

Beyond his eccentricity he is an attentive host, going above and beyond to look after the inn's patrons. In both regards he leaves a memorable mark which helps bring repeat business to the inn.

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/README.md)

On graduation day, Zarrus Maleron is well composed despite the inn being completely full. This is putting a strain on his abilities to help others, but he soldiers on diligently in his usual eccentric manner.

Beyond graduation day, Zarrus is back to his usual eccentric self.
