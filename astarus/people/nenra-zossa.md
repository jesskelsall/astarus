## History

Nenra lived most of her life in Eaglesfield. She spent a lot of time watching the Eaglesfield [Astornox](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) training new soldiers for the war (Syntenne-Astor war) effort.

Eventually she couldn't watch new hopeful recruits get churned up by the system anymore, and moved outside of the town.

She claims that she and her husband were visited by [Malnesh](../gods/gods/malnesh.md) one starry night out on the plains, who instructed them on how to honour the dead. From that day they both devoted themselves to [Malnesh](../gods/gods/malnesh.md) fully.

After he died of old age 4 years ago, she has been running [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) by herself, though with the help of everyone around her.

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/README.md)

Nenra Zossa is in [the Malneshitas](../places/buildings/temples/the-malneshitas.md) when the party arrives in [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md).

When the party enters the temple, at first she assumes that they are here to join the village as Malneshi. She has no concept of the [Astorrel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

She is acutely aware that creatures in the [Walna Forest](../places/forests/walna-forest.md) are disrupting the village's ability to log wood, but believes that her worship will help the village weather the situation.

Nenra can point the party to the following people for more info:

- [Kulegar Bronhor](kulegar-bronhor.md) at [Arnaside Logging Camp](../places/structures/arnaside-logging-camp.md).
  - Knows more about the attacks.
- [Zanni Flipwit](zanni-flipwit.md) at [Zanni Flipwit's House](../places/buildings/zanni-flipwits-house.md).
  - Was inside when their house was attacked.
