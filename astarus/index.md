## Magic

There is magic in this world, though it is uncommon. Most people have never seen magic in practice before.

Those who wield magic are born with an innate ability to wield it. It is not hereditary and there is often no rhyme or reason to who has magical abilities. As a result, magic users are in high demand or are able to exert their power to command others.

Non-magic people are often fearful of those who possess it, as it often spells trouble for those who stay close.

## History

Astarus is relatively new. This means that the land is largely unexplored, unsettled, and devoid of ruins.
