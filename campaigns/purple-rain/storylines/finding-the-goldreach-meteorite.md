## Summary

The [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite, which crash landed near the town of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), hasn't been found by anyone in two days and counting. [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) tasks the [Purple Rain](../purple-rain.md) party with finding it for him.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../purple-rain.md) Prelude

Two days before the [Purple Rain](../purple-rain.md) campaign begins, a meteor falls from the sky and impacts north west of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), on the edge of the [Hawkswood](../../../astarus/places/forests/hawkswood.md) ([Hawkswood North East](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-north-east.md)), punching a hole through a cave ([Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md)) where it came to rest.

Since then, many people have came to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) to find it, including [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md), who arrived from [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) in search of the meteorite. Nobody has managed to find it yet.

### [PR01](../sessions/PR01.md)

During [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md)'s inspection of [The Slippery Weasel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/the-slippery-weasel.md) inn, the [Purple Rain](../purple-rain.md) party, who are sitting together, are approached by [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md). He asks them what they know about the meteor. They tell him they don't know much. In response he explains that he is looking for it, and is paying up to 50 gp if people can help him, with the full amount given to those who return the actual meteorite to him.

The party doesn't initially take him up on his offer. Wrenn tells them to find him at 12 [Flute Street](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/flute-street.md) ([Alistair Hawthorn's House](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/alistair-hawthorns-house.md)) if they wish to accept.

### [PR03](../sessions/PR03.md) / [PR04](../sessions/PR04.md)

The party meets [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) at [Alistair Hawthorn's House](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/alistair-hawthorns-house.md) on [Flute Street](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/flute-street.md) as instructed, so that they may help him find the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite.

He tells them what he has found out so far - that it appeared to come down to the north west, around the edge of the [Hawkswood](../../../astarus/places/forests/hawkswood.md), and that nobody has found a crater of any kind yet. He also explains that he will not be accompanying them and will be waiting here for their return, but that his crow familiar will be keeping an eye on them.

### [PR04](../sessions/PR04.md)

The party begins searching the plains and farmland north west of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) ([Goldreach North West Plains](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-north-west-plains.md)) in search of the meteor.

At [Nightcrest Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/nightcrest-farm.md), Arneg Tanagark recounts being woken up in the night by the thud of the meteor hitting the ground, but he has no idea from which direction the sound came.

### [PR05](../sessions/PR05.md)

Heading further north west from [Nightcrest Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/nightcrest-farm.md), the party investigates [Ray Lake](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/ray-lake.md) for any signs that the meteor may have landed there. They catch the attention of Nelson Cadash and Beltari Yoradoris who are fishing on the lake. They inform the party that they believe the meteor crash landed north of their settlement on the other side of the lake. Additionally, one of their own, Jacob, went in search of the meteorite several days ago and hasn't returned since.

Asking for more information at the settlement, the settlers corroborated this story. Jacob left the night after the meteor fell, determined to find it himself despite his father forbidding him to do so.

Traveling onwards, the party came to [Hurley Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hurley-farm.md). Janus Hurley tells the party that he was awake that night due to his dog Patch barking at what he presumes was wolves. He recalls the sound of the meteor impacting north west of his farm, and that it sounded close.

### [PR06](../sessions/PR06.md)

The party followed the wolf tracks into [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), finding numerous slaughtered wolves. They followed the cave deeper, looking for a sign of what may have killed them, fearing the presence of a greater danger.

In the cave's largest chamber the party came face to face with a Meteoric Watcher for the first time. It was investigating bodies near to the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite, which was glowing a bright white. As it sighted the party, it shifted quickly to a purple glow, alerting the watcher to their presence.

### [PR07](../sessions/PR07.md)

In [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), the party fought two of the three Meteoric Watchers present, while the third stayed hidden on the ceiling, watching them.

During the fight, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) jumped onto the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite to cover its purple glow. She was rendered unconscious, while the meteorite immediately stopped glowing, fading to a dull grey.

The watchers tried a variety of strategies against the party, seeing how they would react to their blink ability, one person ([Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)) being focused, blink-in ambushes, and ranged combat in rough terrain.

Ultimately the party destroyed both watchers while the third silently fled the chamber through the hole in the roof. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) inspects the meteorite, seeing it is cracked, and pockets some of the Meteoric Dust contained within.

### [PR08](../sessions/PR08.md)

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) clumsily scoops up some of the Meteoric Dust mixed in with the meteor crater gravel. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) keeps hold of the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite, wrapping it in a cloth and attaching it to the side of her belt.

The party begins to make their way out of [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) and back towards [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) with the intention of reporting back to [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) with their findings.

### [PR09](../sessions/PR09.md)

After finding [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) in the [Heather & Horticulture](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/heather-and-horticulture.md) secret garden, there is a brief moment amongst the panic where Wrenn asks what the party found out about the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteor.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) shows Wrenn the Meteoric Dust that she collected. Wrenn is excited to see it and attempts to taste a small amount of it, but [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) stops him, explaining that it had previously been glowing purple.

[Torbra Tauff](../../../astarus/people/torbra-tauff.md) and [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) talk briefly of a grey dog-like creature with blade arms that they defeated, to which Wrenn congratulates them, but while also trying to hide the colour draining wave of shock that overtakes him.

### [PR11](../sessions/PR11.md)

While on the run from [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), the party gets a chance to tell [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) of the ordeals they faced in the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md). They tell him more or less everything:

- Meteorite
  - Found in a crater inside a cave.
  - Glowed white until they saw it directly, then purple.
  - [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) passed out and it stopped glowing when she threw herself on top of it.
  - Cracked, with Meteoric Dust inside, which [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) collected.
- Meteoric Watchers
  - Grey, dog-like creatures with blade arms.
  - Could teleport.
  - Likely that they fought 2.
  - Collapsed into Meteoric Dust when killed.
    - [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md)'s Eldritch Blast.
    - [Torbra Tauff](../../../astarus/people/torbra-tauff.md)'s halberd swing. Scraping sound, dulled the blade.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) shows Wrenn the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite. He declares it an excellent specimen, the finest he's seen, and commends them for their work. He tries to take it from [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) but she is reluctant to give it up. Wrenn tells her that he'll give it back to her once he's examined it first hand, and does.
