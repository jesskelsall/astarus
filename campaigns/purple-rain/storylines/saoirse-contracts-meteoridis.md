## Summary

While fighting the Meteoric Watchers in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) touches the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite, infecting her mind and body with Meteoridis. Compulsions and changes begin to stir within her.

## History

### [PR07](../sessions/PR07.md)

During the fight with the Meteoric Watchers in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) throws her entire body on top of the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite in an attempt to hide the purple glow which she believed may have been benefitting the watchers in the cave.

She immediately passed out on top of the meteorite. While unconscious, she dreamed of a evening's sky filled with stars, all beginning to move in tandem, shifting from white to purple as they accelerated. It felt good, and she wished to be back in the cave, close to the meteorite and the watchers. Here Meteoridis compulsions began.

When [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) wild shaped into a horse kicked the meteorite, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) immediately woke up. She was able to rejoin the fight, but was compelled to grab the meteorite as she went.

### [PR08](../sessions/PR08.md)

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) allows [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) to look at the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite briefly. She keeps hold of it for the party, wrapping it in a cloth and attaching it to the side of her belt.

### [PR11](../sessions/PR11.md)

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) gives [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) the pouch of Meteoric Dust that she collected. When [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) points out that [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) also has the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite in her possession, he insists on seeing it. She holds it out in the palm of her hand, but is reluctant to hand it over to Wrenn.

She insists that Wrenn gives her the pouch of dust back in exchange for the meteorite, which he agrees to, but still she won't let it go easily. She demands a pinkie promise from Wrenn in order to part with it, and only if he will return it to her once he's done looking.

He complies. After looking at the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteor, he hands it back to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) for safe keeping.

This is a clear manifestation of her compulsion to stay near to Meteoric Dust.
