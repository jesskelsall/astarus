## Summary

[Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter [Vilnia Kovas](../../../astarus/people/vilnia-kovas.md) is killed by the party as they defend themselves while seeking [sanctuary](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md). Her partner [Kur Merkys](../../../astarus/people/kur-merkys.md) swears revenge at any cost.

## History

### Between Sessions

[Vilnia Kovas](../../../astarus/people/vilnia-kovas.md) and [Kur Merkys](../../../astarus/people/kur-merkys.md) become aware of the party as words spreads from [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) to Eaglesfield and then on to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) that a party of 4 potential [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) are on the run heading south.

They opt to stay in [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) for the time being and potentially confront them if they are sighted closer to the city.

### [PR17](../sessions/PR17.md)

As the [Northhaven Wall](../../../astarus/places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) guard tower bells ring out in the middle of the night, [Vilnia Kovas](../../../astarus/people/vilnia-kovas.md) and [Kur Merkys](../../../astarus/people/kur-merkys.md) make their way to [Kirrel](../../../astarus/gods/gods/kirrel.md) Street in case there is a use for laying an ambush before the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

Hearing shouting coming from around [Astor Square](../../../astarus/places/structures/astor-square.md), Vilnia uses Major Illusion to construct a building facade in the middle of the street near to the stronghold's gatehouse. The pair stand in the street just beyond the illusion, waiting for trouble.

As the party rounds the corner, they step forward, ready to engage them. They intend to capture as many of them as can, hopefully all of them, as their position as [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunters demands. The more of them they capture, the more they get paid.

While the pair prepare to make their first moves, [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../../astarus/people/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) shoots an arrow at Vilnia, enraging Kur. He retaliates by shooting a Lightning Bolt at Sparrow, knocking him unconscious.

As Vilnia's Suggestion spell fails to take hold on [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md), and Kur's Scorching Ray doesn't hit as many times as would be ideal, they collectively fail to subdue the party. The [Astornox guards](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/ranks/1-guard.md) who are still catching up aren't able to arrive in time to help them directly.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) follows Sparrow's lead and knocks Vilnia unconscious with Magic Missile. When she comes to consciousness soon thereafter, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) puts her down a second time.

Kur falls victim to a combination of [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)'s Magic Missile and [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s Ice Knife, both sniping at him from the rooftop opposite, as he had done to Sparrow moments before. He falls unconscious.

As he is being brought to consciousness by an [Astornox Guard Corporal](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/ranks/2-guard-corporal.md), [Vilnia Kovas](../../../astarus/people/vilnia-kovas.md) succumbs to her wounds and dies in the street. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) fires an Eldritch Blast at Kur, knocking him unconscious again. He is once again brought to consciousness.

### Between Sessions

In the immediate aftermath of the fight, Kur does not remember waking up the first time. He does however remember seeing Vilnia go down at the hands of [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md). Finding her dead, his emotions quickly shift from shock and sorrow to blind rage. He swears to himself that he will kill [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) as revenge for taking his partner's life, no matter what it takes.

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

When [Levelle Tristwix](../../../astarus/people/levelle-tristwix.md) visits the party in [sanctuary](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../../../astarus/places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), they explain that due to the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) killed on their way through [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md), if they were to leave the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), they would likely be killed.

This is in reference to [Vilnia Kovas](../../../astarus/people/vilnia-kovas.md)' death specifically, though Levelle isn't aware of Kur's quest for revenge.
