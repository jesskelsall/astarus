## Summary

[Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) is an Earth Genasi, somehow descended from Giants, a birth shrouded in mystery. As she grew up, she started to show signs of her earth elemental nature, and affinity for the giants' runic magic.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../purple-rain.md) Prelude

[Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) was abandoned as a baby in the Irewood on the opposite side of the [River Humar](../../../astarus/places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) from Iredale. Here she was found and adopted by her adoptive parents. Her real parents are unknown.

At the age of five her skin started to turn more grey, and rocky protrusions started to grow on her back. With nobody to help her understand these changes, she has set out into the world to learn more about who and what she is.

### [PR01](../sessions.md/PR01.md)

In [The Slippery Weasel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/the-slippery-weasel.md) inn, [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) tells [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md) that she is passing through town on her way to meet a wise sage. When [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) offers the [Purple Rain](../purple-rain.md) party work finding the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteor for him, she asks for knowledge as payment - Wrenn will gain her access to a library in [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) where she might research her skin pigmentation and rocky back.

### [PR10](../sessions.md/PR10.md)

When [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) asks [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) if she is [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) answers that she's not sure what she is.

### [PR11](../sessions.md/PR11.md)

While everyone is chatting and eating during the rest stop on the way towards [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md), [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) starts hearing voices in her right ear. They are low pitched and guttural, chanting in a language that she cannot comprehend.

The appearance of these voices cause her to look around for their source, but she finds nothing.

Not long after, while trying to climb into the back of the cart so the party can resume their journey, the voices start again. She freezes in place, both hands and one foot on the back of the cart. She attempts to rub the side of her head to make them stop, but they grow louder.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) notices that she has just frozen, and helps her up into the cart. [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) sits down and stares off into space, holding her head on both sides and whispering to herself, muttering "stop it" repeatedly. When [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) asks her if she's alright, she openly admits that she is hearing voices.

As soon as the cart pulls away, the voices leave [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md)'s head.
