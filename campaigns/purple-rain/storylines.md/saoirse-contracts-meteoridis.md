## Summary

While fighting the Meteoric Watchers in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) touches the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite, infecting her mind and body with Meteoridis. Compulsions and changes begin to stir within her.

## History

### [PR7](../sessions.md/7.md)

During the fight with the Meteoric Watchers in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) throws her entire body on top of the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite in an attempt to hide the purple glow which she believed may have been benefitting the watchers in the cave.

She immediately passed out on top of the meteorite. While unconscious, she dreamed of a evening's sky filled with stars, all beginning to move in tandem, shifting from white to purple as they accelerated. It felt good, and she wished to be back in the cave, close to the meteorite and the watchers. Here Meteoridis compulsions began.

When [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) wild shaped into a horse kicked the meteorite, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) immediately woke up. She was able to rejoin the fight, but was compelled to grab the meteorite as she went.

### [PR8](../sessions.md/8.md)

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) allows [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) to look at the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite briefly. She keeps hold of it for the party, wrapping it in a cloth and attaching it to the side of her belt.
