## Summary

[Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) returns from a trip to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) to her house ([Wizira's House](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/wiziras-house.md)) to find her father ([Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s Father) missing. Where has he gone?

Having been captured by the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) for being a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), he is shipped to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/README.md) where he will be conscripted. It is up to the party to stop this and return him home.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../README.md) Prelude

Nearly two days prior to the start of the [Purple Rain](../README.md) campaign and the day after the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite crashed down near the town of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) returned home from  a bustling [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) to find her father missing.

Their house's door had been kicked in and there were signs of a struggle, but no evidence of where her father was.

After searching their part of the Hawkwswood around their house, [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) returned home and passed out from panic. Waking up the next day, she headed into [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) to investigate further. Finding the town still busy, and unable to find Heather in her shop, she eventually took a seat in the shop's secret garden between the buildings, lamenting on the events of the past few days.

### [PR1](../sessions.md/1.md)

When Heather Pentz finds [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) in her secret garden, [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) tells her of what happened. Unsure what she can do to help, Heather offers to search for any information she can, before giving [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) 1 gp to spend to take her mind off things.

Later, after meeting the rest of the [Purple Rain](../README.md) party in [The Slippery Weasel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/the-slippery-weasel.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) sees through [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s *Disguise Self* spell and blackmails her into helping him, or be reported to the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) for being a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md).

Wrenn suggests that he may be able to help her locate her father if she is cooperative.

### [PR4](../sessions.md/4.md)

When the party meet [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) at [Alistair Hawthorn's House](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/alistair-hawthorns-house.md) to accept his offer of [finding the Goldreach Meteorite](finding-the-goldreach-meteorite.md) for him, Wrenn reiterates his previous comment that he will help her find her father. He commits to finding out what he can about him while they are away.

Returning to [Heather & Horticulture](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/heather-and-horticulture.md) before leaving town on the search, [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) is told by Heather Pentz that there were [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) present in the forest on the day of his disappearance. She found this out through her contacts at the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) (she is a retired [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md)), though did so at great personal risk, and at her extreme discomfort. She is visibly shaken from the ordeal.
