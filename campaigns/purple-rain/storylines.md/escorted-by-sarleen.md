## Summary

While the party attempts to make their way to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) following the capture of [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md), [Goshawk Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md) comes to their rescue.

[Sarleen Truestriker](../../../astarus/people/sarleen-truestriker.md), an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/2-squad-hand.md) in [Goshawk Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md), finds the party along the [River Humar](../../../astarus/places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) and leads them back to her [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/3-squad-lead.md), [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../../astarus/people/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md).

## History

### Between Sessions

Not long after being captured, Wrenn is woken up by the movement of the horse he is draped over. Keeping his composure, he manages to cast Sending with the copper wire coiled around his wrist, contacting [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../../astarus/people/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) ([Goshawk squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md) lead) to explain his capture and the danger the party is in:

> Help! Captured by bandits. Please help my friends! Hunted by [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md). They know information that will save Astor. Get them to Elysia!

> Captured near [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md). Heading to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) by boat or road. Blue firbolg, grey human--

Hidaar, trusting what his colleague Wrenn has told him, and particularly concerned by the potential stakes, dispatches his [Astorrel Squad Hands](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/2-squad-hand.md) in search of the party. They split up, each taking a different route from [Ulburn](../../../astarus/places/villages/ulburn.md) towards [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md). Their orders are to search for a blue firbolg and a grey human, and escort them back to him so that he may help them seek sanctuary in [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md).

### [PR14](../sessions.md/PR14.md)

While camping on the eastern shore of the [River Humar](../../../astarus/places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), the party meet [Sarleen Truestriker](../../../astarus/people/sarleen-truestriker.md) as the sun rises and they are getting ready for the day ahead.

They explain that they're an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/2-squad-hand.md) in [Goshawk Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md), and that Hidaar wants to help them get into [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md). She offers to escort them to him.

The party is reluctant to accept help from a stranger, particularly one that knows who they are, but she convinces them of her trustworthiness when she reveals that Wrenn messaged Hidaar after being captured by [The Crimson Blades](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/the-crimson-blades.md), indicating a level of trust. They agree to go with her.

The party travels along the eastern bank of the river, the boat now too big for all of them to use.

At nightfall they make camp between the river and some cliffs. During the night while Sarleen and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) are on watch, gnolls attack from the cliffs above. The rest of the party is woken up, and together they dispatch the gnolls before returning to sleep for the remainder of the night.
