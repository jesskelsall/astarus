## Summary

For some time the classification of firbolgs as people of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/README.md), rather than as part of the forest, has been a topic of controversy. The [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have been indecisive in addressing this issue.

The conscription of [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s Father based on their race alone brings this issue to the attention of the [Astornar](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornar.md) who must pass judgement.
