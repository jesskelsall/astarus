## Summary

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) is an aasimar, rather than a human, but she doesn't know it yet. Often unwelcome prophetic dreams have been present throughout her life, and she has a sense that something about herself doesn't add up. She will learn the truth within herself.

## History

### Deva Dream 1

#### [PR0](../sessions.md/0.md)

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) had a dream of the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteor impacting north west of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md). This drove her to leave Grasthwaite for [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) and investigate.

### Deva Dream 2

#### [PR6](../sessions.md/6.md)

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) once again dreams of the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteor on its way to impact north west of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md). Looking closer she sees a glowing figure with bright glowing wings (her Deva, Seraphina) attempting fruitlessly to stop the meteor, latched to its front, flapping their wings and attempting to slow its fall. The meteor impacts all the same.

The dream continues, showing [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) [finding the Goldreach Meteorite](finding-the-goldreach-meteorite.md) in a crater in the forest, before the forest around it begins burning purple flames. She witnesses [The Slippery Weasel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/the-slippery-weasel.md)'s interior on fire, as well as the barn at [Hurley Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hurley-farm.md) on fire, with the burning bodies of the rest of the [Purple Rain](../README.md) party within.

#### [PR7](../sessions.md/7.md)

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)'s dream and her conviction that it is prophetic leads the party to find [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), where they find a meteorite crater containing the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteor. When the party observes, its glow changes from bright white to purple, much like the flames of the forest did in her dream.
