## Summary

The [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite, which crash landed near the town of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), hasn't been found by anyone in two days and counting. [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) tasks the [Purple Rain](../README.md) party with finding it for him.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../README.md) Prelude

Two days before the [Purple Rain](../README.md) campaign begins, a meteor falls from the sky and impacts north west of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), on the edge of the Hawkswood ([Hawkswood North East](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-north-east.md)), punching a hole through a cave ([Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md)) where it came to rest.

Since then, many people have came to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) to find it, including [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md), who arrived from [Northhaven](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/README.md) in search of the meteorite. Nobody has managed to find it yet.

### [PR1](../sessions.md/1.md)

During [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md)'s inspection of [The Slippery Weasel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/the-slippery-weasel.md) inn, the [Purple Rain](../README.md) party, who are sitting together, are approached by [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md). He asks them what they know about the meteor. They tell him they don't know much. In response he explains that he is looking for it, and is paying up to 50 gp if people can help him, with the full amount given to those who return the actual meteorite to him.

The party doesn't initially take him up on his offer. Wrenn tells them to find him at 12 [Flute Street](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/flute-street.md) ([Alistair Hawthorn's House](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/alistair-hawthorns-house.md)) if they wish to accept.

### [PR3](../sessions.md/3.md) / [PR4](../sessions.md/4.md)

The party meets [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) at [Alistair Hawthorn's House](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/alistair-hawthorns-house.md) on [Flute Street](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/flute-street.md) as instructed, so that they may help him find the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite.

He tells them what he has found out so far - that it appeared to come down to the north west, around the edge of the Hawkswood, and that nobody has found a crater of any kind yet. He also explains that he will not be accompanying them and will be waiting here for their return, but that his crow familiar will be keeping an eye on them.

### [PR4](../sessions.md/4.md)

The party begins searching the plains and farmland north west of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) ([Goldreach North West Plains](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-north-west-plains.md)) in search of the meteor.

At [Nightcrest Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/nightcrest-farm.md), Arneg Tanagark recounts being woken up in the night by the thud of the meteor hitting the ground, but he has no idea from which direction the sound came.
