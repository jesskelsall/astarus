## Summary

After [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) accidentally tells [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md) that he knows [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md), Wrenn and the [Purple Rain](../README.md) party flee [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) as fugitives, hoping for sanctuary at the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

## History

### Between Sessions

[Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md), fearing that [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s Father may have been captured by the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md), goes to the [Goldreach Astornox Stronghold](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-astornox-stronghold.md) to search for evidence to support his theory.

While he is snooping around, he is caught by one of the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md), who fetches [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md). The two friends talk about what he is doing, but in doing so, Wrenn accidentally reveals that he's had contact with [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) and did not turn her in as a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), enraging Alistair.

Alistair offers Wrenn an ultimatum: wait for the party's return and turn them in when they arrive back at [Alistair Hawthorn's House](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/alistair-hawthorns-house.md), or face punishment as a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harborer. Knowing that the penalty for an [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) is likely death, Wrenn feels he has no choice but to accept.

Thinking about his next move, Wrenn decides to hire some meteor adventurers to find the party north west of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), and sends his crow familiar with them. Wrenn leaves Alistair's house and goes into hiding, feeling certain that staying would not save him from his fate, certain that the party is his last hope of survival.

This sends [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md) into a rage. He sends guards north west after the party, apprehending Arneg Tanagark as a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harborer along the way. When he is returned to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), Alistair sends his [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) through [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) in the night to search for Wrenn.

### [PR8](../sessions.md/8.md)

On the way back to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) with the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite, the [Purple Rain](../README.md) party attempts to stop in at [Nightcrest Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/nightcrest-farm.md), seeking the hospitality of Arneg Tanagark for an overnight stay. They find his door open, a disturbance inside, and a small blood splatter in the courtyard.

The party is approached by an [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) Commander and an [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) Guard who inform them that the farm is off limits after Arneg was taken into custody as a suspected [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harborer.

The commander, unfazed by [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s firbolg form, offer to escort the party back to [Holyrook Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/holyrook-farm.md) so that they can sleep for the night. While doing this, the guard heads off for [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), intending to tell the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) that they have found [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md).

While crossing the bridge south of [Nightcrest Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/nightcrest-farm.md), two meteor adventurers hired by [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) ask the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) commander where [Hurley Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hurley-farm.md) is. The guard is courteous and points them up the road. While this happens, Wrenn's crow familiar swoops down and begins pecking and scratching his face.

The adventurers circle back, one drop-kicking the commander while the other warns the party that Wrenn is in danger, they must get back to him, and not to get caught.

### [PR9](../sessions.md/9.md)

As the party make their way through the streets of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) continues to summon and dismiss Dancing Lights to distract the guards while he moves.

[Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md), disguised as an [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) Guard, comes across other [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) who are searching for him, heading towards the [Goldreach Marketplace](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-marketplace.md). It is clear that lots of guards are searching for him in a coordinated way.

Wrenn talks to [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) using Message, explaining that things are not going to plan, and asking the party to meet him in the [Heather & Horticulture](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/heather-and-horticulture.md) secret garden, which they do.

Here, Wrenn and Heather explain that Wrenn managed to find out about [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s Father being captured by the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md), but in doing so was caught. Now they need to leave town, or as Wrenn alludes to, he will likely end up dead.

With a need to flee, Wrenn suggests that they can find sanctuary at either the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) (having revealed he is [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md), not [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md)), or at the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Temple. Either would be temporary fixes. The party chooses the former.

While leaving the shop, [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md), still disguised, gets roped into the search effort by another group of guards and their [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) Commander, while the rest of the party prepares to skip town.

### [PR10](../sessions.md/10.md)

The party begins to leave [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md).

[Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) follows the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) Commander to the [Goldreach Marketplace](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-marketplace.md). Here she sees [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md) chastising the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) under his command for not having found [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) yet. He insists that they double down on their search efforts within [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), checking each house before returning to him.

One of his officers suggests that he raise the alarm to the neighbouring towns. Alistair dismisses the idea, knowing that it must be done, but insisting they search more before he informs other towns that he's failed to capture a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harbouring [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md).

[Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) participates in the door-to-door searching briefly, going as far as to search inside of one house before slipping away to the edge of town.

The rest of the party makes their way to the edge of town, linking back up with [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) outside of the [Four Scythes Inn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/four-scythes-inn.md). From here they make their way towards the [Goldreach Stables](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-stables.md). Along the way they are spotted by 3 [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) Guards who give pursuit.

Desperate for a way to escape town, the party commandeers a horse and cart from the stables, riding it out entryway right as the guards enter. They attempt to give chase but quickly realise that they're not going to be able to catch them on foot.

Now clear of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) shows the party his [Meteoric Map of Astor](../../../astarus/other/meteoric-map-of-astor.md). He explains that the large garrison of [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) at Eaglesfield will pose a problem, and that the longer they take to reach [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md), the more [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) will be looking for them.

[Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) suggests that the party makes their way to Frizthwaite before either traveling down the [River Humar](../../../astarus/places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), or along the [Humar Cut](../../../astarus/places/roads/humar-cut.md), keeping off the [Northern Road](../../../astarus/places/roads/northern-road.md).

Near the beginning of Grasthwaite Cut, the party sees 2 [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) on horseback riding towards them.
