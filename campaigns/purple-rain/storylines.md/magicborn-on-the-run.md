## Summary

After [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) accidentally tells [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md) that he knows [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md), Wrenn and the [Purple Rain](../README.md) party flee [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) as fugitives, hoping for sanctuary at the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

## History

### Between Sessions

[Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md), fearing that [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s Father may have been captured by the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md), goes to the [Goldreach Astornox Stronghold](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-astornox-stronghold.md) to search for evidence to support his theory.

While he is snooping around, he is caught by one of the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md), who fetches [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md). The two friends talk about what he is doing, but in doing so, Wrenn accidentally reveals that he's had contact with [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) and did not turn her in as a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), enraging Alistair.

Alistair offers Wrenn an ultimatum: wait for the party's return and turn them in when they arrive back at [Alistair Hawthorn's House](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/alistair-hawthorns-house.md), or face punishment as a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harborer. Knowing that the penalty for an [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) is likely death, Wrenn feels he has no choice but to accept.

Thinking about his next move, Wrenn decides to hire some meteor adventurers to find the party north west of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), and sends his crow familiar with them. Wrenn leaves Alistair's house and goes into hiding, feeling certain that staying would not save him from his fate, certain that the party is his last hope of survival.

This sends [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md) into a rage. He sends guards north west after the party, apprehending Arneg Tanagark as a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harborer along the way. When he is returned to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), Alistair sends his [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) through [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) in the night to search for Wrenn.

### [PR8](../sessions.md/8.md)

On the way back to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) with the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite, the [Purple Rain](../README.md) party attempts to stop in at [Nightcrest Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/nightcrest-farm.md), seeking the hospitality of Arneg Tanagark for an overnight stay. They find his door open, a disturbance inside, and a small blood splatter in the courtyard.

The party is approached by an [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) Commander and an [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) Guard who inform them that the farm is off limits after Arneg was taken into custody as a suspected [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harborer.

The commander, unfazed by [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s firbolg form, offer to escort the party back to [Holyrook Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/holyrook-farm.md) so that they can sleep for the night. While doing this, the guard heads off for [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), intending to tell the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) that they have found [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md).

While crossing the bridge south of [Nightcrest Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/nightcrest-farm.md), two meteor adventurers hired by [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) ask the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) commander where [Hurley Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hurley-farm.md) is. The guard is courteous and points them up the road. While this happens, Wrenn's crow familiar swoops down and begins pecking and scratching his face.

The adventurers circle back, one drop-kicking the commander while the other warns the party that Wrenn is in danger, they must get back to him, and not to get caught.
