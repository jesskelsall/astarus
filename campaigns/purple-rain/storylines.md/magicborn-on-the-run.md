## Summary

After [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) accidentally tells [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md) that he knows [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md), Wrenn and the [Purple Rain](../purple-rain.md) party flee [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) as fugitives, hoping for sanctuary at the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

## History

### Between Sessions

[Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md), fearing that [Wizira's Father](../../../astarus/people/wiziras-father.md) may have been captured by the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md), goes to the [Goldreach Astornox Stronghold](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-astornox-stronghold.md) to search for evidence to support his theory.

While he is snooping around, he is caught by one of the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md), who fetches [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md). The two friends talk about what he is doing, but in doing so, Wrenn accidentally reveals that he's had contact with [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) and did not turn her in as a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), enraging Alistair.

Alistair offers Wrenn an ultimatum: wait for the party's return and turn them in when they arrive back at [Alistair Hawthorn's House](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/alistair-hawthorns-house.md), or face punishment as a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harborer. Knowing that the penalty for an [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) is likely death, Wrenn feels he has no choice but to accept.

Thinking about his next move, Wrenn decides to hire some meteor adventurers to find the party north west of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), and sends his crow familiar with them. Wrenn leaves Alistair's house and goes into hiding, feeling certain that staying would not save him from his fate, certain that the party is his last hope of survival.

This sends [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md) into a rage. He sends guards north west after the party, apprehending Arneg Tanagark as a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harborer along the way. When he is returned to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), Alistair sends his [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) through [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) in the night to search for Wrenn.

### [PR08](../sessions.md/PR08.md)

On the way back to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) with the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite, the [Purple Rain](../purple-rain.md) party attempts to stop in at [Nightcrest Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/nightcrest-farm.md), seeking the hospitality of Arneg Tanagark for an overnight stay. They find his door open, a disturbance inside, and a small blood splatter in the courtyard.

The party is approached by an [Astornox Guard Corporal](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/ranks/2-guard-corporal.md) and an [Astornox Guard](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/ranks/1-guard.md) who inform them that the farm is off limits after Arneg was taken into custody as a suspected [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harbourer.

The corporal, unfazed by [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s firbolg form, offer to escort the party back to [Holyrook Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/holyrook-farm.md) so that they can sleep for the night. While doing this, the guard heads off for [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), intending to tell the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) that they have found [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md).

While crossing the bridge south of [Nightcrest Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/nightcrest-farm.md), two meteor adventurers hired by [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) ask the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) corporal where [Hurley Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hurley-farm.md) is. The guard is courteous and points them up the road. While this happens, Wrenn's crow familiar swoops down and begins pecking and scratching his face.

The adventurers circle back, one drop-kicking the corporal while the other warns the party that Wrenn is in danger, they must get back to him, and not to get caught.

### [PR09](../sessions.md/PR09.md)

As the party make their way through the streets of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) continues to summon and dismiss Dancing Lights to distract the guards while he moves.

[Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md), disguised as an [Astornox Guard](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/ranks/1-guard.md), comes across other [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) who are searching for him, heading towards the [Goldreach Marketplace](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-marketplace.md). It is clear that lots of guards are searching for him in a coordinated way.

Wrenn talks to [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) using Message, explaining that things are not going to plan, and asking the party to meet him in the [Heather & Horticulture](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/heather-and-horticulture.md) secret garden, which they do.

Here, Wrenn and Heather explain that Wrenn managed to find out about [Wizira's Father](../../../astarus/people/wiziras-father.md) being captured by the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md), but in doing so was caught. Now they need to leave town, or as Wrenn alludes to, he will likely end up dead.

With a need to flee, Wrenn suggests that they can find sanctuary at either the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) (having revealed he is [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), not [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md)), or at the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Temple. Either would be temporary fixes. The party chooses the former.

While leaving the shop, [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md), still disguised, gets roped into the search effort by another group of guards and their [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/ranks/3-guard-sergeant.md), while the rest of the party prepares to skip town.

### [PR10](../sessions.md/PR10.md)

The party begins to leave [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md).

[Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) follows the [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/ranks/3-guard-sergeant.md) to the [Goldreach Marketplace](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-marketplace.md). Here she sees [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md) chastising the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) under his command for not having found [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) yet. He insists that they double down on their search efforts within [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), checking each house before returning to him.

One of his officers suggests that he raise the alarm to the neighbouring towns. Alistair dismisses the idea, knowing that it must be done, but insisting they search more before he informs other towns that he's failed to capture a [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harbouring [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

[Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) participates in the door-to-door searching briefly, going as far as to search inside of one house before slipping away to the edge of town.

The rest of the party makes their way to the edge of town, linking back up with [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) outside of the [Four Scythes Inn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/four-scythes-inn.md). From here they make their way towards the [Goldreach Stables](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-stables.md). Along the way they are spotted by 3 [Astornox Guards](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/ranks/1-guard.md) who give pursuit.

Desperate for a way to escape town, the party commandeers a horse and cart from the stables, riding it out entryway right as the guards enter. They attempt to give chase but quickly realise that they're not going to be able to catch them on foot.

Now clear of [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) shows the party his [Meteoric Map of Astor](../../../astarus/other/meteoric-map-of-astor.md). He explains that the large garrison of [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) at Eaglesfield will pose a problem, and that the longer they take to reach [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md), the more [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) will be looking for them.

[Torbra Tauff](../../../astarus/people/torbra-tauff.md) suggests that the party makes their way to [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md) before either traveling down the [River Humar](../../../astarus/places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), or along the [Humar Cut](../../../astarus/places/roads/humar-cut.md), keeping off the [Northern Road](../../../astarus/places/roads/northern-road.md).

Near the beginning of Grasthwaite Cut, the party sees 2 [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) on horseback riding towards them.

### [PR11](../sessions.md/PR11.md)

The party pass 2 [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) on horseback without any incident. The guards had no idea of their notoriety and passed by completely unaware.

Torbra took the horse and cart off road in the direction of [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md) to the south west. Stopping for a food break and to discuss their plan of action, the whole party agreed that they should take a less traveled route, first heading to [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md) and then either down the [River Humar](../../../astarus/places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) or along the [Humar Cut](../../../astarus/places/roads/humar-cut.md).

Torbra finally got a chance to sleep while [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) rode the horse and cart. This meant that everyone has had a long rest since leaving [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md).

With [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md) in view on the horizon, 3 horses each with 2 riders approached from behind. Neither [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) who spotted them or [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) who used his crow familiar to observe them could tell if they are [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) or not.

### [PR12](../sessions.md/PR12.md)

The bandits tailing the party as they ride towards [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md) begin their attack after seeing the cart take a sharp right turn, forcing their hand. Before long they are on top of the fleeing party. They are led by [Morog Whiteknuckle](../../../astarus/people/morog-whiteknuckle.md).

Sensing an imminent battle, the party stops the carts, unhitches the draft horse for Torbra to ride into battle, and turns the cart on its side to act as cover for the rest of the group.

A mounted battle breaks out, with several of the bandits trying to capture [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) while others take shots with crossbows from horseback.

Eventually the battle culminates with:

- [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) getting knocked unconscious, barely clinging onto life, having been clubbed by two thugs.
- [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) overwhelmed by a battle on two fronts, attempting to save Wrenn from the bandits.
- [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) fleeing from [Morog Whiteknuckle](../../../astarus/people/morog-whiteknuckle.md) who has been slashing at her repeatedly, heavily injuring her.
- [Torbra Tauff](../../../astarus/people/torbra-tauff.md) falling off her horse, unable to respond to the threats around her before surrender is the party's only option.

Morog orders the party to surrender, which they reluctantly do. He reveals himself to be part of [The Crimson Blades](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/the-crimson-blades.md), and that Wrenn owes them money. He makes the point that they're here for him only, which is why they're lucky to be alive.

With no response to the bandits, Morog leaves with the unconscious [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) successfully captured - the party's best chance of seeking sanctuary in [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) taken from them.

### Between Sessions

Not long after being captured, Wrenn is woken up by the movement of the horse he is draped over. Keeping his composure, he manages to cast Sending with the copper wire coiled around his wrist, contacting [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../../astarus/people/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) ([Goshawk squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md) lead) to explain his capture and the danger the party is in:

> Help! Captured by bandits. Please help my friends! Hunted by [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md). They know information that will save Astor. Get them to Elysia!

> Captured near [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md). Heading to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) by boat or road. Blue firbolg, grey human--

Shortly thereafter Morog notices that Wrenn is muttering to himself and confiscates his copper wire before restraining him more thoroughly.

## [PR13](../sessions.md/PR13.md)

The party enters the village of [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md) to try and get a boat so they can proceed downstream to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md), avoiding the roads. [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) does not disguise herself while in the village.

Inquiring at the docks, they find they can either buy a boat for 50 gp or rent one for no more than a week.

When the party enters [The Greedy Trout](../../../astarus/places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-greedy-trout.md) for a drink before deciding what to do, they come across 2 [Astornox guards](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/ranks/1-guard.md) who are at the bar conversing with the innkeeper. [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) heads down the street, leaving the village outskirts as a means of putting distance between herself and the guards. As she goes she attracts the attention of people on the street who have already seen the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) who are looking for her.

At the bar [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) learns from the innkeeper that the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are looking for someone "tall and blue" ([Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)), and someone with "grey skin" (Torbra). She joins [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and Torbra at their table where she tells them of the former. The group agrees that they'd best leave [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md) quickly.

A villager who saw [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) bursts into the inn, shouting that she's seen her. The [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) rush downstairs to meet her, insisting she shows them where she saw her. They leave in a hurry.

A race to find [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) before the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) do develops. The party fans out before [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) finds [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) making a flower crown. She disguises herself as an old man and the party reconvenes.

The party convinces Torbra to head downstream now, so as to avoid being seen. The rest of the party head back to the docks where [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) buys the boat. Picking Torbra up on the way, they make their way down the [River Humar](../../../astarus/places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) towards [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md), successfully dodging the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md).
