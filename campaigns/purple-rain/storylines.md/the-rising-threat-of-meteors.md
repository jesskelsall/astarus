## Summary

Strange meteors are bringing unknown and dangerous creatures to Astor. Their dangerous nature and consistent arrival is concerning those who are paying close attention.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../README.md) Prelude

6 months prior to the start of the [Purple Rain](../README.md) campaign, [Astral Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/astral.md) notices strange meteors crashing to the ground within the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/README.md). They take it upon themselves to investigate them outside of their regular [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) mission duties.

For the last 6 months, a meteor has fallen roughly once a month.

One member of [Astral Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/astral.md) is a seer who has been able to predict when and where several of the meteors will land. This leads [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) to set off for [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) 5 days before the meteor lands, arriving only 2 days after it does.

Wrenn intends to find the meteorite and return it to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) so that they may investigate its properties and nature, furthering their independent research.

### [PR1](../sessions.md/1.md)

[Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) meets the [Purple Rain](../README.md) party, offering them up to 50 gp if they are able to bring him evidence of the meteorite - ideally the meteorite itself.
