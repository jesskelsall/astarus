## Summary

Strange meteors are bringing unknown and dangerous creatures to Astor. Their dangerous nature and consistent arrival is concerning those who are paying close attention.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../README.md) Prelude

6 months prior to the start of the [Purple Rain](../README.md) campaign, [Astral Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/astral.md) notices strange meteors crashing to the ground within the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/README.md). They take it upon themselves to investigate them outside of their regular [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) mission duties.

For the last 6 months, a meteor has fallen roughly once a month.

One member of [Astral Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/astral.md) is a seer who has been able to predict when and where several of the meteors will land. This leads [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) to set off for [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) 5 days before the meteor lands, arriving only 2 days after it does.

Wrenn intends to find the meteorite and return it to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) so that they may investigate its properties and nature, furthering their independent research.

### [PR1](../sessions.md/1.md)

[Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) meets the [Purple Rain](../README.md) party, offering them up to 50 gp if they are able to bring him evidence of the meteorite - ideally the meteorite itself.

### [PR6](../sessions.md/6.md)

In [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), the party discover that half of the wolf pack had been slaughtered by something deeper within, a forboding omen.

Delving deeper into the cave, they find the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite, emitting bright white light, and a Meteoric Watcher, searching through the bodies of its victims. When the party is in the line of sight of the meteorite, it turns purple, alerting the watcher to their presence.

### [PR7](../sessions.md/7.md)

The party fights two Meteoric Watchers who are seemingly protecting the meteorite, though in reality they are testing the party's combat prowess like those that came before.

Their grey formless face and body, with its weird 6 limb arrangement is foreign to the party. They are a force to be reckoned with, but eventually the party dispatches them, turning them to grey dust with their final blows.
