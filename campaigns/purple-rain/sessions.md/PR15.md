### Town Crier

*Graduation:*

> New [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) graduates begin their service! 100 new [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have joined the organisation's ranks after the graduation ceremony lead by [Astorrel Commandant](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/8-commandant.md) [Levelle Tristwix](../../../astarus/people/levelle-tristwix.md) and Captain [Merkin Thorgus](../../../astarus/people/merkin-thorgus.md). They will join the mission to preserve [Kirrel](../../../astarus/gods/gods/kirrel.md)'s blessings and keep the great [Kingdom of Astor](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/README.md)'s ambitions in balance with their will.

*Firbolg Controversy:*

> Protests in [Eskrigg](../../../astarus/places/cities/eskrigg.md)! Locals fight for the rights of Firbolgs in the [Mocker Swamp](../../../astarus/places/forests/mocker-swamp.md). The [Eskrigg](../../../astarus/places/cities/eskrigg.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) took swift action to punish these troublemakers for disturbance of the peace and challenging the judgement of Major [Legacy Aranius](../../../astarus/people/legacy-aranius.md).

*[Magicborn on the run](../storylines.md/magicborn-on-the-run.md):*

> Five [magicborn on the run](../storylines.md/magicborn-on-the-run.md) from [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) are still at large! Wizard [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md), a gnome with balding ginger hair, and his accomplices, were last seen fleeing south.
> 
> Contact the nearest [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) if you see a tall blue female, a strong grey skinned human with brown hair, a pale human girl with long blonde hair, and another human girl with long red hair.
>
> The [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are offering a reward for any useful information on any of these [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md)!

*Inane 1:*

> Construction of the Southern Temple has finished! [Yeatscale](../../../astarus/places/cities/yeatscale.md)'s temple to [The Order of the Diamond](../../../astarus/gods/the-order-of-the-diamond.md) was completed with an opening ceremony by General Supreme Corville Thornox himself. Glory to the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/README.md) and her ambitions in South [Kardan](../../../astarus/places/continents/kardan.md)!

*Inane 2:*

> A new potion store is opening soon on [Crafters Course](../../../astarus/places/streets/crafters-course.md)! Glug by Gwinthel will be making available only the finest in alchemical imbibements, and at a generous price! Look out for Glug by Gwinthel, and [Gwinthel Greenhand](../../../astarus/people/gwinthel-greenhand.md), coming to a store near you!

### Chase

- Events progress quickly: indecision = inaction.
- Athletics checks vs guards for distance
- Possible to shake off guards with line of sight break and hiding.
  - Much harder with more guards.
- Actions and time attract more guards.
- Perception disadvantage in some situations.

## Sanctuary

- With a member of [Goshawk squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md): almost foregone conclusion.
  - Proof of being [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) + familiarity with guards.
- Without an [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) - much harder.
  - [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) guards can turn party away.
  - Persuasion with disadvantage.
    - Firbolg controversy might negate this.
- [Astorrel vs Astornox](../../astorrel-agents/storylines/astorrel-vs-astornox.md):
  - Potential for conflict at the gate.
  - Jurisdiction is demarcated by the gate.
  - If the party are not inside, the [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) won't stop the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) from taking them.
