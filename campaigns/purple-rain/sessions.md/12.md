## Recap

- Retrieved [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteor for [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md).
- Headed back to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md).
- Escorting [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) Commander was ambushed by people telling the party that Wrenn was in trouble, and to find him.
- Made their way into [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) at night, searching for him.
- Found him at [Heather & Horticulture](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/heather-and-horticulture.md)'s secret garden.
- Wrenn explained that [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s Father was captured by the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md), and was shipped out the day before to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) for conscription.
- Wrenn is being hunted by the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) for harbouring [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) - [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md). The whole party is implicated.
- Wrenn revealed himself as an [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md), rather than an [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md).
- The party agreed to head to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) to seek sanctuary against the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) with the [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md).
- The party left [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) on a stolen horse and cart after being chased through the streets.
- [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) rode the party south through the night.
- By day, 2 [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) on horseback passed by without issue.
- [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) took the cart off road towards Frizthwaite after consulting Wrenn's map.
- One everyone woke up, the party planned their next move towards Frizthwaite and towards [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) off the beaten track, avoiding the large [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) garrison at Eaglesfield.
- The party recanted the tale of how they came to possess the meteorite, and the strange creatures they fought while in the cave.
- Wrenn was light on details of why he is researching the meteor, stopping before he said too much.
- Riding through the day towards Frizthwaite, the party became aware of 3 horses with 2 riders each, trailing them at a distance. It wasn't clear if they were [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) or not.
- [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) casts Pass Without Trace and takes a hard right turn.
