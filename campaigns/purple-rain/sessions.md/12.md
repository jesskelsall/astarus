## Recap

- Retrieved [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteor for [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md).
- Headed back to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md).
- Escorting [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) Commander was ambushed by people telling the party that Wrenn was in trouble, and to find him.
- Made their way into [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) at night, searching for him.
- Found him at [Heather & Horticulture](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/heather-and-horticulture.md)'s secret garden.
- Wrenn explained that [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md)'s Father was captured by the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md), and was shipped out the day before to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) for conscription.
- Wrenn is being hunted by the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) for harbouring [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) - [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md). The whole party is implicated.
- Wrenn revealed himself as an [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), rather than an [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md).
- The party agreed to head to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) to seek sanctuary against the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) with the [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).
- The party left [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) on a stolen horse and cart after being chased through the streets.
- [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) rode the party south through the night.
- By day, 2 [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) on horseback passed by without issue.
- [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) took the cart off road towards [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md) after consulting Wrenn's map.
- One everyone woke up, the party planned their next move towards [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md) and towards [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) off the beaten track, avoiding the large [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) garrison at Eaglesfield.
- The party recanted the tale of how they came to possess the meteorite, and the strange creatures they fought while in the cave.
- Wrenn was light on details of why he is researching the meteor, stopping before he said too much.
- Riding through the day towards [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md), the party became aware of 3 horses with 2 riders each, trailing them at a distance. It wasn't clear if they were [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) or not.
- [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) casts Pass Without Trace and takes a hard right turn.

## [Pass Without Trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace)

- No tracks.
- +10 to stealth checks.
- Only affects creatures. Carts still leave tracks.

## Bandits on Horseback

- 3 horses, each with 2 riders.
  - Horse 1: [Morog Whiteknuckle](../../../astarus/people/morog-whiteknuckle.md) ([Berserker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/berserker), rider), [Thug](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/thug).
  - Horse 2, 3: [Bandit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bandit) (rider), [Thug](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/thug).

The group is part of [The Crimson Blades](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/the-crimson-blades.md). [Morog Whiteknuckle](../../../astarus/people/morog-whiteknuckle.md) is here to capture [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) at any cost, and return him to [Stalker](../../../astarus/people/stalker.md) in Carnmere. He owes them the rest of their pay for finding the Carnmere Meteorite.

Wrenn is not aware that they succeeded, assuming that they'd ran off with his money.

## [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md)

- No [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) present.
  - [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) come from [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md) roughly every other day. They were here yesterday.
- Normal village activity with no concept of the party as fugitives.

## [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md)

If the party passes by [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md) by river, by the time they do, word will have reached the [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) of their crimes. The guards are on watch looking for people matching their descriptions.

[Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) guards up [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md)'s waterside watchtowers should give the party cause for concern.

- [Guards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/guard) have +2 perception.

## Boat Travel

- No special mechanics.
- Vehicles (water) proficiency can be added to any boat controlling rolls.
