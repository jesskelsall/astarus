## [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) Rescue

[Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) was able to use Sending (twice) to get a message to [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../../astarus/people/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md), leader of [Goshawk Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md):

> Help! Captured by bandits. Please help my friends! Hunted by [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md). They know information that will save Astor. Get them to Elysia!

> Captured near [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md). Heading to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) by boat or road. Blue firbolg, grey human--

[Goshawk Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md) is currently at Ulburn. Hidaar orders his squad to fan out and search for the party.

Whichever route they take, [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../../astarus/people/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) finds them after riding around searching. She identifies either [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) (blue firbolg) or [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) (grey human) and asks them for the name of the person they just lost as proof that it's them.

She explains that her [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/3-squad-lead.md), Hidaar, received a message from Wrenn, and they came as quick as they could. They should meet with him at Ulburn to figure out what's going on.
