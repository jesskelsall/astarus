## TODO

- Character development:
  - [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) Aasimar awakening
    - Dream recollection
    - Potential moment for first wing use.
  - [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) Aasimar awakening
    - Similarity between [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and her deva in dream
- New [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad.
  - The one what will meet the party.
  - What their plan is.

## [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md)

- No [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) present.
  - [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) visit [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md) infrequently on no real schedule. Were here yesterday.
- Normal village activity with no concept of the party as fugitives.
- Following morning:
  - [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) reach the town looking for Wrenn and the party.
  - Searching the buildings, starting with the inn.

## [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md)

If the party passes by [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md) by river, by the time they do, word will have reached the [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) of their crimes. The guards are on watch looking for people matching their descriptions.

[Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) guards up [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md)'s waterside watchtowers should give the party cause for concern.

- [Guards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/guard) have +2 perception.

## Boat Travel

- No special mechanics.
- Vehicles (water) proficiency can be added to any boat controlling rolls.

## [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) Rescue

[Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) was able to use Sending (twice) to get a message to [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../../astarus/people/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md), leader of [Goshawk Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md):

> Help! Captured by bandits. Please help my friends! Hunted by [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md). They know information that will save Astor. Get them to Elysia!

> Captured near [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md). Heading to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) by boat or road. Blue firbolg, grey human--

[Goshawk Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md) is currently at Ulburn. Hidaar orders his squad to fan out and search for the party.

Whichever route they take, [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../../astarus/people/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) finds them after riding around searching. She identifies either [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) (blue firbolg) or [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md) (grey human) and asks them for the name of the person they just lost as proof that it's them.

She explains that her [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/3-squad-lead.md), Hidaar, received a message from Wrenn, and they came as quick as they could. They should meet with him at Ulburn to figure out what's going on.
