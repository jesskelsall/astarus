## TODO

- Character development:
  - [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) Aasimar awakening
    - Dream recollection
    - Potential moment for first wing use.
  - [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) Aasimar awakening
    - Similarity between [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and her deva in dream
- New [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad.
  - The one what will meet the party.
  - What their plan is.

## Battle Aftermath

- [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md): bleeding from cuts to arms and chest.
- [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md): heavily injured.
- [Torbra](../../../astarus/people/torbra.md): Exhausted from horse riding, combat, falling off horse.
- [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md): Regains consciousness. Bruised and sore from clubbing.

## [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md)

- No [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) present.
  - [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) visit [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md) infrequently on no real schedule. Were here yesterday.
- Normal village activity with no concept of the party as fugitives.
- Following morning:
  - [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) reach the town looking for Wrenn and the party.
  - Searching the buildings, starting with the inn.

## [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md)

If the party passes by [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md) by river, by the time they do, word will have reached the [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md) [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) of their crimes. The guards are on watch looking for people matching their descriptions.

[Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) guards up [Beckermet](../../../astarus/places/towns/beckermet.md)'s waterside watchtowers should give the party cause for concern.

- [Guards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/guard) have +2 perception.

## Boat Travel

- No special mechanics.
- Vehicles (water) proficiency can be added to any boat controlling rolls.
