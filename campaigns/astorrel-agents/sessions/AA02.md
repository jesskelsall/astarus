## Evening in [The Rose Buckler](../../../astarus/places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md)

While sat at a table in [The Rose Buckler](../../../astarus/places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md)'s tavern, the party discusses what to call their squad. [Ahsha Sallas](../../../astarus/people/ahsha-sallas.md) suggests [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md), due to her familiarity with the bird's use in mining from her home town of [Mockerkin](../../../astarus/places/towns/mockerkin.md). The name sticks.

The party enjoy a few rounds of Fox Tail Brewery "Blood Moon".

[Redwyn Humpledopper](../../../astarus/people/redywn-humpledopper.md) notices that the rowdy bunch of patrons towards the back of the tavern are playing games of [Twenties](../../../astarus/other/twenties.md), which has drawn a crowd. She heads over and joins in, slamming 5 gp down. [Jaxon Ultari](../../../astarus/people/jaxon-ultari.md) invites her to play for 1 gp stakes. She wins the game, pocketing 1 gp in winnings. Redwyn takes her remaining 4 gp from the table, choosing to quit while she's ahead.

As the drinks keep flowing, the party deals with their booze in different ways.

| Character | Booze |
| --- | --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../../../astarus/people/ahsha-sallas.md) | Hoovers up the drinks that other people don't want. |
| [Ephaine Seren](../../../astarus/people/ephaine-seren.md) | Struggles with 1 drink. Gives [Tydrus Tinshield](../../../astarus/people/tydrus-tinshield.md) one of hers. |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../../astarus/people/redywn-humpledopper.md) | Drinking happily. |
| [Whisper on the Breeze](../../../astarus/people/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | Drinking happily. |

The party decides to start turning in for the night, choosing to stay at [the Rose Buckler](../../../astarus/places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) rather than going back to [The Mission's End](../../../astarus/places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-missions-end.md). [Ephaine Seren](../../../astarus/people/ephaine-seren.md) is concerned about not having her Star Map which her mentor [Ludolf Hornwallis](../../../astarus/people/ludolf-hornwallis.md) promised to give her today, while Whisper sticks around with the intention of sneaking out after everyone else has gone to bed.

When Ahsha and Redwyn retire to bed, Ephaine and Whisper head back out into the night to take care of other business.

## Whisper [Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md) Chat 2

Whisper leaves [The Rose Buckler](../../../astarus/places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) and heads for [Diamond Prime](../../../astarus/places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md), heading back across [Astor Square](../../../astarus/places/structures/astor-square.md). Seeing barely anyone inside, she heads in.

Once again she heads over to the shrine to [Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md) and prays, bowing her head for a few moments. When nothing happens, they start grumbling, refusing to touch the statue.

*[Whisper on the Breeze](../../../astarus/people/whisper-on-the-breeze.md):*
> Come on, do something! I know you're in there.

After what seems like an eternity, the statue begins glowing again. The statue itself emanates a golden white light, dazzling Whisper. It does not appear to cast light in the physical space around it - there is no light cast on the pedestal or any shadows in the room surrounding it. The echoing female voice is heard once more.

*[Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md):*
> What is it that you seek?

*[Whisper on the Breeze](../../../astarus/people/whisper-on-the-breeze.md):*
> Closure.

*[Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md):*
> If that's what you wish.

Whisper locks eyes on the statue, preparing to bow. In the middle of one of her blinks, the statue loses its glow in an instant, startling them.

Satisfied with what just happened, Whisper leaves [Diamond Prime](../../../astarus/places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md) quietly, turning in at [The Rose Buckler](../../../astarus/places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md) for the night.

## Ephaine Meets Her Mentor

While sat in [The Rose Buckler](../../../astarus/places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md), [Ephaine Seren](../../../astarus/people/ephaine-seren.md) receives a Message from her mentor [Ludolf Hornwallis](../../../astarus/people/ludolf-hornwallis.md), telling her that he's here in [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md), and to come and find him. He doesn't explain exactly where he is.

Ephaine heads back to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) searching for him. She passes through the stronghold gatehouse for the first time, getting checked by the guards stationed there before being allowed in. Checking inside [Auric Rise](../../../astarus/places/buildings/auric-rise.md) for any hints, she finds Ludolf sat in the lobby's seating area. He notices her and hangs his head. He reeks of booze and looks tired and anguished.

Ephaine comforts him, asking if he's doing okay. Ludolf dodges the question at first, handing Ephaine the Star Map. Ephaine casts Guidance on him. After she presses again, Ludolf explains that he wasn't able to face the graduation ceremony as seeing all of the new up and coming graduates reminded him that his [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) career is coming to an end and he is unlikely to progress beyond [Astorrel Lieutenant](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/5-lieutenant.md). She asks if he is going to retire soon, but he reassures her that he has much work to do yet training new graduates, his life's passion.

## Morning Business

*[Long rest]*

First thing in the morning, [Whisper on the Breeze](../../../astarus/people/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) heads over to [S.Q. Wirral & Son](../../../astarus/places/buildings/shops/sq-wirral-and-son.md) to collect their custom black dyed leather armour, before returning to [The Rose Buckler](../../../astarus/places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md).

The party has breakfast and drinks (alcoholic in Ahsha's case), before heading back to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) to get their first mission from [Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md).

## The Squad's First Mission

The party returns to [Auric Rise](../../../astarus/places/buildings/auric-rise.md). On entry, an [Astorrel Member](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/1-member.md) ushers them over when they try to proceed straight upstairs, checking their log book, finding record of them being expected. With that, they head upstairs to [Bryce Morton's Office](../../../astarus/places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md), heading inside.

The other squad is already here, much to Ahsha's annoyance, who says "damn it!", causing a grin to form on [Penance Zahiri](../../../astarus/people/penance-zahiri.md)'s face.

The party gets a look at what the other squad have spent their graduation purse on:

| [Ruby Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby.md) | Equipment | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Darius Dunn](../../../astarus/people/darius-dunn.md) | Robes, staff with an amber jewel at its tip | Stares hauntingly at Redwyn, looking away when she sees this.
| [Morgan Caithness](../../../astarus/people/morgan-caithness.md) | Ring mail, great axe | Raises her great axe to Ahsha when she acknowledges their shared weaponry.
| [Penance Zahiri](../../../astarus/people/penance-zahiri.md) | Chain mail, shield adorned with symbol of [Bhygar](../../../astarus/gods/gods/bhygar.md), longsword | Grins when Ahsha is frustrated about being there second.<br />Enthusiastically compliments Whisper's custom armour. |
| [Tabari Se](../../../astarus/people/tabari-se.md) | Monk's clothes, quarterstaff |

[Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md) begins the meeting early as everyone has arrived. He once again explains how acting [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/3-squad-lead.md) works, particularly that he will be picking one per squad per mission, and that they won't get the additional pay perk.

Seeing as one person from each squad received the Exceptional Trainee Bonus, he assigns both Ahsha and Darius as acting squad leads on the first mission.

He asks for the names that each squad have picked from themselves. Ahsha tells Bryce that they have decided to call themselves [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md). Morgan announces that their name is [Ruby Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby.md).

Bryce dishes out the squad's first missions:

| Squad | Acting Lead | Mission | Bounty | Time Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Ruby Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby.md) | [Darius Dunn](../../../astarus/people/darius-dunn.md) | [Investigate Bear Attacks in Hartsgarth](../storylines/investigate-bear-attacks-in-hartsgarth.md) | 30 gp | 10 days |
| [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md) | [Ahsha Sallas](../../../astarus/people/ahsha-sallas.md) | [Check Logging in Arnaside](../storylines/check-logging-in-arnaside.md) | 20 gp | 14 days |

With that, Bryce sits back down, expectantly waiting for both squads to leave.

*[Ahsha Sallas](../../../astarus/people/ahsha-sallas.md):*
> Alright Canaries, let's fly!

On the way out, Penance catches Ahsha, remarking that [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md) is a cool name, and asks whose idea it was. Ahsha initially credits Ephaine, but when she objects, they both declare it a team effort.

## Leaving [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md)

Once outside of [Bryce Morton's Office](../../../astarus/places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md), the group consult their [Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../../../astarus/other/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md), planning their journey. Deciding to travel along the [Coastal Trail](../../../astarus/places/roads/coastal-trail.md), they make their way out of the [Sunset District](../../../astarus/places/districts/sunset-district.md) in search of horse-powered travel by road.

Taking the south eastern exit through the [Northhaven Wall](../../../astarus/places/structures/northhaven-wall.md), the party finds a stable. Here they weigh up their options. Finding buying their own horses will be too expensive, they settle on hiring a coach.

The party approaches one of the waiting coaches, finding [Clay Mullen](../../../astarus/people/clay-mullen.md) hanging around awaiting business. When Ahsha points out where they're going using the squad's map, he informs them that he's never been to [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) before nor seen a map with it on before, and is suspicious.

Following Ephaine casting Guidance on Ahsha, Ahsha haggles for a better price than the quoted 5 gp 3 sp, offering 5 gp providing "there is no trouble along the way", judging the party capable of keeping him and his coach safe. He also offers the same price for the return journey if they need it.

The party hops into the coach, sitting across from each other in pairs, with a small window on each side to peer out of.

## Hitting the [Coastal Trail](../../../astarus/places/roads/coastal-trail.md)

The party sits back while Clay drives the coach along the [Coastal Trail](../../../astarus/places/roads/coastal-trail.md), winding round [Duskmere](../../../astarus/places/rivers-lakes/duskmere.md), the view of [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) and its spires visible on the horizon for a time.

Sitting in the coach in the summer's heat, the day proceeds without incident.

As it is starting to get dark, Clay informs the party that they should probably camp for the night. The party agrees, so he pulls the coach off of the road and prepares his sleeping bag on the top of the cart. The party sets up a campfire and agrees on a 2 hour watch rotation to see the night through.

| Character | Shift | Observations |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../../../astarus/people/ahsha-sallas.md) | 2h | Uneventful. Fox skulking around. |
| [Ephaine Seren](../../../astarus/people/ephaine-seren.md) | 2h | Uneventful. Too distracted. |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../../astarus/people/redywn-humpledopper.md) | 2h | Uneventful. Bats flying past. |
| [Whisper on the Breeze](../../../astarus/people/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | 2h | Uneventful. Small rodents rustling. |

*[Long rest]*

As the sun rises, the party prepares for the road again, setting off in earnest. Ephaine asks Clay how far they are out. He informs her that they'll probably reach [Humouth](../../../astarus/places/villages/humouth.md) by nightfall. When he asks the party whether they'd like to stop in for the night or not, they decide they'd rather press on in the interests of time.

## Bandits on the Road

Around mid-afternoon, Clay halts the cart, which comes to a stop suddenly. There is a dead horse on the road ahead which must be moved in order to proceed. The party gets out to help.

Ahsha, Ephaine and Whisper make their way to the horse while Redwyn stays back with Clay and the coach. Ephaine inspects the horse, finding it to have been sliced several times on its underside. It appears relatively fresh, within the past day. Ahsha begins to drag it from the road.

While this is happening, crossbow bolts shoot out from the roadside as bandits begin their ambush. One catches Ephaine in the arm. The party is surrounded by a group of bandits.

As combat begins, several of the bandits rush from behind the trees, engaging Whisper at first, while Ahsha and Ephaine flank another.

Ephaine uses her Starry Form, causing her skin to begin to glow bright white, with golden streaks cascading down her face, her eyes glowing. Between her other attacks, she shoots fast moving beams of sunlight from her palms.

Two bandits approach the coach from the side, shouting at Clay, telling him to surrender or they'll kill his horse. With a natural 1, Clay laughs at them, causing one bandit to climb onto the cart and attack him, rendering him unconscious.

As the fight progresses, the party makes short work of the bandits near the horse and begin to focus their attention on the bandits nearest the coach. After initially not being aware of Clay's desperate situation, Ephaine casts Healing Word, stabilising him.

With few bandits remaining, the final 2 alive decide to make a run for it, but are eventually stopped by the combined ranged prowess of Whisper, Redwyn, and Ephaine.

## Ambush Aftermath

Whisper searches the bodies of the bandits, retrieving:

- 3 gp 2 sp
- 3 rations
- 14 crossbow bolts

Ahsha grabs a Light Crossbow. Whisper hands her the crossbow bolts they found. Without a crossbow bolt case Ahsha is able to have a bolt loaded and ready to go, but will need to expend an action to reload a bolt from her backpack directly.

Ahsha goes back to the dead horse and moves it off of the road. Ephaine steers the coach off the road and out of the way.

[Clay Mullen](../../../astarus/people/clay-mullen.md) is clearly not in a good way, regaining consciousness after his injuries. He doesn't remember what happened, but tries and fails to get up at the mention of bandits, before settling down. He asks if someone else can drive for now as he is clearly incapable.

The party loads him into the back of the coach along one of the benches, forcing two people to ride up front. Ephaine drives to coach while Ahsha rides up front with her, navigating.

Continuing along the [Coastal Trail](../../../astarus/places/roads/coastal-trail.md) for the rest of the day, the party lays eyes on the village of [Humouth](../../../astarus/places/villages/humouth.md) around late evening.

## Arriving at [Humouth](../../../astarus/places/villages/humouth.md)

The party steers the coach into the centre of [Humouth](../../../astarus/places/villages/humouth.md), arriving at the marketplace. They get their first impression of the windy village and how the villagers here are outside only for as long as they need to.

Here they quickly find The Keeper's Reprise, heading inside to seek lodging and stabling for the night. Here they meet the innkeeper, [TODO INNKEEPER], who they tell about the bandits they found, their injured coach driver, and their [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission to [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md). Overwhelmed by the bombardment of talking points, [TODO INNKEEPER] discusses with them their lodging needs.

Ahsha pays for 3 double rooms (1 gp 8 sp to [TODO INNKEEPER]) and for stabling (5 sp per night to [TODO BILL]). The rest of the party get Clay, who is still dazed and struggling to walk on his own, into the inn. He is dazed and isn't quite sure where he is.

Ahsha once again asks about if there are any [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) here. [TODO INNKEEPER] informs her that there is no persistent guard presence here. They were here last week and have moved on to [Allonby](../../../astarus/places/villages/allonby.md), where they will likely stay for a while before coming back this way. The lack of [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) gives Ahsha the sense that bandits could take advantage of this poorly guarded area easily. On explaining that the party killed 8 bandits on their journey here, [TODO INNKEEPER] gives them a round of ale on the house, for a deed well done.

[TODO INNKEEPER] prepares food for the party, telling them to come back down in an hour. They also impress upon them the constant wind here, and that it's rare that they get visitors. Ahsha buys another round, bringing their tab to 3 gp.

Whisper takes Clay upstairs and puts him to bed, keeping the room key to themselves as the doors in this inn can only be locked from the inside, and older chunky locking mechanism.

The party spend some time cleaning up and tending to their wounds before settling down for the night. It is a restless night's sleep due to the howling wind outside.
