## Planning

### TODO

- [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md)
  - [Adventures for Adventurers](../../../astarus/places/buildings/shops/adventures-for-adventurers.md)
  - [Tarsha Nulas](../../../astarus/people/tarsha-nulas.md)
- Kobolds
  - Traps
  - Caves including enemies

### Random Happenings in [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md)

- [Gwinthel's Potion Tombola](../events/gwinthels-potion-tombola.md) ([Astor Square](../../../astarus/places/structures/astor-square.md))
- [Twenties](../../../astarus/other/twenties.md) (tavern tables)

### [Retrieving Ephaine's Star Map](../storylines/retrieving-ephaines-star-map.md)

[Ephaine Seren](../../../astarus/people/ephaine-seren.md) still needs to retrieve her star map.

### Mission Briefings

At 10:00 the following day, [Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md) is once again in his office waiting for both squads to arrive.

Arriving in [Auric Rise](../../../astarus/places/buildings/auric-rise.md), [players](../../../players/logan.md) must explain who they're here to see and why, before they are allowed further into the building. Bryce has left a note, so they're allowed to go straight up once the [Astorrel Member](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/1-member.md) checks behind front desk.

| [Ruby Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby.md) | Equipment |
| --- | --- |
| [Darius Dunn](../../../astarus/people/darius-dunn.md) | Robes, staff |
| [Morgan Caithness](../../../astarus/people/morgan-caithness.md) | Ring mail, great axe |
| [Penance Zahiri](../../../astarus/people/penance-zahiri.md) | Chain mail, shield, longsword |
| [Tabari Se](../../../astarus/people/tabari-se.md) | Monk's clothes, quarterstaff |

[Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md) chooses the acting squad leads due to both Ahsha and Darius receiving the Exceptional Trainee Bonus at graduation (top 5%).

| Squad | Acting Lead | Mission | Bounty | Time Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Ruby Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby.md) | [Darius Dunn](../../../astarus/people/darius-dunn.md) | [Investigate Bear Attacks in Hartsgarth](../storylines/investigate-bear-attacks-in-hartsgarth.md) | 30 gp | 10 days |
| [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md) | [Ahsha Sallas](../../../astarus/people/ahsha-sallas.md) | [Check Logging in Arnaside](../storylines/check-logging-in-arnaside.md) | 20 gp | 14 days |

Bryce dismisses both squads, wishing them good luck.

### Heading to [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md)

#### Transport

The party can source over-land transport to [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) from the stables just inside the [Sunrise District](../../../astarus/places/districts/sunrise-district.md).

- Scheduled supply cart: free
  - Only as far as [Allonby](../../../astarus/places/villages/allonby.md)
  - Limited space

#### Travel

The [Astorrel Map of South East Kardan](../../../astarus/other/astorrel-map-of-south-east-kardan.md) is a kingdom scale map. Each hex is 6 mi.

| Pace | mi/Hour | mi/Day | Hex/Hour | Hex/Day | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fast | 4 mi | 30 mi | 1 hex / 1.5 hr | 5 hexes / day | -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores |
| Normal | 3 mi | 24 mi | 1 hex / 2 hr | 4 hexes / day | |
| Slow | 2 mi | 18 mi | 1 hex / 3 hr | 3 hexes / day | Able to use Stealth. |

## Forest Traps

The kobolds have set traps to ward off anyone at [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) that dares venture closer to their cave.

Falling: 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 10ft fell (max 20d6).

- Sample Traps (DMG p122)
  - Simple Pit
  - Hidden Pit
  - Falling Net

### Spring Spikes

A tripwire between two trees is connected to branches bent around one of those trees. They are covered in sharpened twigs, creating a makeshift spike wall, pulled taut by the rope.

If the tripwire is tripped, the rope holding the branches in place comes loose, and the wall of spikes flies out from the bush obscuring it, hitting the unsuspecting victim.

- Spotting the tripwire: DC 10 perception check.
- Spotting the spikes: DC 13 perception check.
- Disarming the tripwire: same as Falling Net.
- Hit by trap:
  - Dexterity saving throw, DC 15.
    - Half damage on success.
  - 2d10 piercing damage.
