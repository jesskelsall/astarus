### Retrieving Ephaine's Star Map

Ephaine Seren still needs to retrieve her star map.

### Mission Briefings

At 10:00 the following day, [Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md) is once again in his office waiting for both squads to arrive.

Arriving in [Auric Rise](../../../astarus/places/buildings/auric-rise.md), players must explain who they're here to see and why, before they are allowed further into the building. Bryce has left a note, so they're allowed to go straight up once the [Astorrel Member](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/1-member.md) checks behind front desk.
