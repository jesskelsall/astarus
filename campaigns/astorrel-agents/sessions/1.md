### Introduction

> South East Kardan is the perfect place for life to flourish. A land nestled between the snow capped mountain ranges and hemmed in by the Sea of Songs. The land in between is verdant grassy plains, rolling hills, lush forests, snaking rivers and lakes cradled by the mountains.
>
> It was here that the gods brought humans, halflings, and gnomes. Here they were destined to make something of themselves, and so in good time, the Kingdom of Astor formed. It is strong, prosperous, and militaristic. It welcomes anyone with open arms, but punishes harshly those that don't obey.
>
> Though most of the kingdom is controlled by the Astornox, the large military organisation that handles everything from war planning to guard duty, there exists a smaller organisation with a humbler purpose. The Astornox. Protectors of and against nature, keeping Astor's ambition balanced with the natural order.
>
> Two to four years ago, you began a journey to join the Astorrel ranks. Being invited to the recruitment programme is no small feat - the Astorrel are small in number and selective, but that didn't stand in your way. Neither did the training which saw you working with Astorrel mentors to hone your skills and learn about the natural world around you.
>
> Today is graduation day. It's been a long time coming. Over the last week this year's cohort of 100 graduates has finished the 8 day journey from Dunmore, the coastal city where the Astorrel train all of their new hopefuls, to Northhaven, the shining city on the lake and the capital of the kingdom.
>
> Here is where our story begins.

### Graduation Ceremony Speech

All 100 graduates present in [Kirrel Hall](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/places/kirrel-hall.md), lined up and watching the stage. Other [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) look on from the sides.

[Merkin Thorgus](../../../astarus/people/merkin-thorgus.md) welcomes everyone to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/README.md):

*Announcer*

> Introducing [Merkin Thorgus](../../../astarus/people/merkin-thorgus.md), [Astorrel Captain](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/6-captain.md) of [Northhaven](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/README.md)!

*[Merkin Thorgus](../../../astarus/people/merkin-thorgus.md)*

> Welcome to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/README.md), the finest city in Astor. It is my pleasure as the Captain of [Northhaven](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/README.md) to welcome you all here today. I hope that today is one that you remember for the rest of your days, and I hope to work with some of you soon. Best of luck to you all.

[Levelle Tristwix](../../../astarus/people/levelle-tristwix.md) gives the opening speech of the graduation ceremony:

*Announcer*

> And now the commencement speech from [Levelle Tristwix](../../../astarus/people/levelle-tristwix.md), [Astorrel Commandant](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/7-commandant.md)!

*[Levelle Tristwix](../../../astarus/people/levelle-tristwix.md)*

> On today, Mishdag 2nd of Finsbock in the year 312, it is my great pleasure to commence the annual [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) Graduation Ceremony for the 100 graduates present here. Welcome.
>
> You've all worked hard to get here. You've spent 2 to 4 years honing your skills in [Dunmore](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/dunmore.md) so that you can join the [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md), Astor's organisation charged with upholding the ideals of [Kirrel](../../../astarus/gods/gods/kirrel.md) the Generous: to protect nature and its bounties so that future generations can enjoy and benefit from them.
>
> In many ways this is the end of a journey, but actually the real journey begins today. Today you'll pledge yourselves to one of the insider gods, receive your badge, rank, & graduation purse, and then you'll meet your superior officer so you can begin your service.
>
> Remember your training. Be vigilant yet cautious, responsible yet reactive, understanding yet just.
>
> For those of you who become Squad Hands and Squad Leads today, I offer you on final piece of advice. Be respectful and considerate to the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) we work alongside. I have seen much tension between our organisations recently. Don't embarrass our organisation by throwing kindling on the fire.

The announcer explains the next step of the graduation ceremony:

- Go to [Diamond Prime](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/places/diamond-prime.md) in [Astor Square](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/places/astor-square.md) and pledge yourself to one of the insider gods.
- Return here with proof of the deed, within 1 hour.

### Graduation Pledge

The recruits begin to make their way out of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/places/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) and into [Astor Square](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/places/astor-square.md) where [Diamond Prime](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/places/diamond-prime.md) is. The route is lined with citizens ([Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md), [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md), and retired citizens) here to watch and cheer the graduates on.

4 lines form outside [Diamond Prime](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/places/diamond-prime.md), one for each door (left to right: [Bhygar](../../../astarus/gods/gods/bhygar.md), [Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md), [Kirrel](../../../astarus/gods/gods/kirrel.md), [Gormox](../../../astarus/gods/gods/gormox.md)). The players must line up at the door they intend to use.

Inside [Diamond Prime](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/places/diamond-prime.md), only one worshipper is present at each shrine at a time. They pray in whichever way they choose, before a caretaker marks their forehead with a coloured paint with the symbol of their chosen god.

#### Whisper and their God

[Whisper on the Breeze](../../../astarus/people/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) is contacted by the god they choose while they pray. Nobody else is aware of this.

### Graduation Presentation

Back in [Kirrel Hall](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/places/kirrel-hall.md), each graduate now receives their badge, rank, and graduation purse. Graduates are called up in name order and walk across the stage, from stage left to stage right.

- [Levelle Tristwix](../../../astarus/people/levelle-tristwix.md) pins the badge on their robe and shakes their hand.
- [Merkin Thorgus](../../../astarus/people/merkin-thorgus.md) gives them their graduation purse (pouch) and bows.

### Superior Officer Assignments

Following the graduation presentation, the announcer explains that a board at the other side of the room will show you who your superior officer is, and where to report to. Those posted to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/README.md) must immediately report to their superior officers, as they are waiting.

- Fairly equal split between [Northhaven](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/README.md), [Eskrigg](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/eskrigg.md), and [Dunmore](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/dunmore.md).

Job board:

- [Northhaven](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/README.md)
  - [Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md), [Auric Rise](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/places/auric-rise.md), 3H
    - [Ahsha Sallas](../../../astarus/people/ahsha-sallas.md)
    - [Darius Dunn](../../../astarus/people/darius-dunn.md)
    - [Ephaine Seren](../../../astarus/people/ephaine-seren.md)
    - [Morgan Caithness](../../../astarus/people/morgan-caithness.md)
    - [Penance Zahiri](../../../astarus/people/penance-zahiri.md)
    - [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../../astarus/people/redywn-humpledopper.md)
    - [Tabari Se](../../../astarus/people/tabari-se.md)
    - [Whisper on the Breeze](../../../astarus/people/whisper-on-the-breeze.md)

Players can find each other here if they wish (recognising them from the graduation presentation or training), or proceed directly to [Auric Rise](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/northhaven/places/auric-rise.md).

### Redwyn's Mentor

[Redwyn Humpledopper](../../../astarus/people/redywn-humpledopper.md)'s mentor, [Grant Thackeray](../../../astarus/people/grant-thackeray.md), approaches them at this point with [Levelle Tristwix](../../../astarus/people/levelle-tristwix.md). Grant and Levelle are old friends, having been in the same squad when they joined the [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md).

Grant congratulates Redwyn on making [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/2-squad-hand.md), and wishes them all the best. Levelle does the same.

### Ephaine's Mentor

Ephaine Seren's mentor, NAME, has their star map. They told Ephaine that they'd be here today to give it to them after the graduation ceremony. He is nowhere to be seen.

On asking at Auric Rise, he is staying at Valley Under the Stars, but haven't been seen today.

In Valley Under the Stars, NAME can be found drinking in the bar area, heavily intoxicated. He is drowning his sorrows over his creeping age and the likelihood that they're never going to get promoted beyond Astorrel Lieutenant.

He gives Ephaine their star map before retiring to their room.

### Auric Rise

Inside Auric Rise, many people are looking for their superior officers. On the ground floor at the front desk, an Astorrel Member will be able to point out that 3H is on the 3rd floor.

### Bryce Morton's Office

The players enter Bryce Morton's office alongside the members of Ruby Squad. Bryce is waiting within, sat at his desk. He stands up, has a look at everyone, and sits back down.

- Introduces himself.
- Splits the 8 people into 2 squads:
  - Ahsha, Redwyn, Ephaine, Whisper.
  - Darius, Penance, Morgan, Tabari.
- Explains what their duties are and how missions work.
  - He provides missions to each squad which they must complete.
  - Each mission pays a bounty to each Astorrel Squad Hand.
  - The most competent job will be given the better paying missions.
- Explains that he intends to promote one person from each squad to Astorrel Squad Lead.
  - In charge of running the missions. The success or failure of a mission is their responsibility.
  - They get paid a larger mission bounty.
  - He will make a different squad hand an acting squad lead each mission until he has decided.

Bryce then leaves the room to get the squads their maps. During this time the players can talk to the other squad, or Penance gets inquisitive about Whisper.

Bryce returns with his superior, Samantha Ilis. She introduces herself, comments to Bryce that it looks like he has a good bunch, wishes everyone good luck, and leaves.

Bryce provides each squad with an Astorrel Map of South East Kardan.

He tells them to go and kit themselves out, enjoy the rest of their day, and return here at 10:00 tomorrow to receive their first mission.
