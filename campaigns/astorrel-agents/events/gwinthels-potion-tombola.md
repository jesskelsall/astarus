# Gwinthel's Potion Tombola

## Summary

In [Astor Square](../../../astarus/places/structures/astor-square.md), [Gwinthel Greenhand](../../../astarus/people/gwinthel-greenhand.md) is running a tombola to advertise their soon to open potion shop on [Crafters Course](../../../astarus/places/streets/crafters-course.md), Glug by Gwinthel. The prizes are all potions.

Gwinthel has laid their tombola out on a table covered in a floor-length cloth. On top of it is a wooden cylinder with a handle which can be rotated. Inside are small rolls of paper bound in string. A door can be opened to retrieve one.

Their prize potions are stored in a medium sized wood and metal trunk underneath the table. It is locked by a key that they have in a buttoned up pouch.
