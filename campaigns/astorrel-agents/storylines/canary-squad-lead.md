## Summary

The newly formed Canary Squad, made up of the Astorrel Agents party, needs an Astorrel Squad Lead. Bryce Morton must decide who is best suited for the promotion.

## Mission

## History

### AA1

When the party met their new superior officer, Bryce Morton placed them in a squad together which they eventually named Canary Squad.

He explained to them that he would be picking one of them to be promoted from Astorrel Squad Hand to Astorrel Squad Lead. This would have the following perks:

- Increased mission bounty compared to the rest of the squad.
- The success or failure of the mission is more on their shoulders.
- Opportunities for further promotion.

Until he has made his decision, Bryce will be making one squad member per mission "acting Squad Lead" so that they may prove themselves.

## Planning

*See: Astorrel Graduation*  
*See: Check Logging in Arnaside*  
*See: Investigate Bear Attacks in Hartsgarth*

Ahsha Sallas and Darius Dunn will be the first acting Squad Leads, due to their Exceptional Trainee Bonus which they both received as part of their graduation purse. With little other information at this point, Bryce sees this as a sign of strength.

### Mission Reports

At the end of each mission, the acting Squad Lead needs to write a report on how the mission went, which is handed over to Bryce Morton as evidence of the mission's outcome.

This report will be written up in private, so only the player and the DM will be present.

The report needs to talk about what happened, and specifically the outcomes. For each point made, the player must make a skill check (likely persuasion or deception) to see if their writing convinces Bryce.

Additionally the player must write about each squad member's contributions and performance during the mission. Once again, dice rolls are used to see if the report convinces Bryce:

- The player assigns the following dice to squad members: d12, d10, d8, d6.
  - This is a ranking system from best (d12) to worst (d6).
  - The player may choose freely - choosing the d12 for themselves is allowed.
- Each dice is rolled to determine the relative impression that Bryce Morton gets of each squad member.
  - Add the player's persuasion or deception modifier appropriately.
  - Roll each dice with advantage if the mission was a success.

The player is free to discuss the content of the report with the party, as well as what their character was asked to write about, as long as they do not discuss the dice rolling mechanics or the roll outcomes.
