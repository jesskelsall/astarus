## Summary

For unknown reasons, [Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md) has chosen to reach out to [Whisper on the Breeze](../../../astarus/people/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) directly. Typically the gods do not do this - stories of people having interactions with the gods is dismissed as legend or hearsay.

## History

### [AA01](../sessions/AA01.md)

As part of the [Astorrel Graduation](astorrel-graduation.md), [Whisper on the Breeze](../../../astarus/people/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) pledged themselves to [Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md) at [Diamond Prime](../../../astarus/places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md). This was done to prove that they practiced [The Order of the Diamond](../../../astarus/gods/the-order-of-the-diamond.md).

While praying in front of the statue of [Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md) (in mortal form as a hawk), Whisper noticed the statue grow brighter to the point of hurting their eyes. The female voice of [Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md) echoed throughout the temple.

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../README.md)

[Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md) will communicate more with Whisper as time goes on. How Whisper reacts to this and chooses to engage with it will largely determine the content, means, and circumstances.

The first time Whisper willingly reaches out for [Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md), they will answer.

[Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md) will provide Whisper with dreams where they are flying alongside [Valnos](../../../astarus/gods/gods/valnos.md). Together they will visit places and moments from Whisper's past. Eventually these will start to show future places and events of significance.
