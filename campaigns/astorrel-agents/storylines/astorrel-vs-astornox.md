## Summary

Tensions are rising between the [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) and the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) due to their jurisdictions not overlapping, and differing philosophies on various aspects of society.

## History

Over the past 3 years, tensions have been rising between the [Astorrel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/README.md) and [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md). This has lead to bitter disagreements and in extremely rare instances, violence.

The [Astornar](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornar.md) Court rules on matters where the two organisations can't come to an agreement, though this is usually reserved for serious cases that affect the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/README.md) fundamentally.

### [Astorrel Agents](../README.md)

During the [Astorrel Graduation](astorrel-graduation.md), [Levelle Tristwix](../../../astarus/people/levelle-tristwix.md) gave a graduation speech that included a caution to all of the graduates. They should avoid conflict with the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/README.md) and work peacefully and cooperatively alongside them. Levelle specifically said that tensions are rising.
