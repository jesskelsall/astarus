## History

## Planning

[Ruby Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/crimson.md) sets off for their mission in earnest.

Upon their return, they report that they have killed 3 brown bears living in a cave on the outskirts of town, and have brought back bear claws as proof.

[Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md) is happy with this outcome.
