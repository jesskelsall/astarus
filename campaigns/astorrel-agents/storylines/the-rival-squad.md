## Summary

Canary Squad and Ruby Squad are natural rivals, with the same superior officer in Bryce Morton.

## History

### AA1

When the party met their new superior officer, Bryce Morton placed them in a squad together which they eventually named Canary Squad. He placed his other four subordinates in a squad which they eventually named Ruby Squad.

Through inference, the players likely realise that they are not only competing amongst themselves to stand out, but also against their sister squad.

## Planning

When both squads are given their first missions, Ruby Squad will be given what looks like the more exciting mission, and the one that pays better.

| Squad | Mission | Bounty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canary Squad | Check Logging in Arnaside | 20 gp |
| Ruby Squad | Investigate Bear Attacks in Hartsgarth | 30 gp |

Penance Zahiri will grin at Canary Squad when the missions are given out, giving a clear indication of the competitiveness that they feel.

Much later, Canary Squad will get the opportunity to fight against Ruby Squad in the Autumn Festival's Kirrel Clash tournament.
