## Summary

[Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md) and Ruby Squad are natural rivals, with the same superior officer in [Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md).

## History

### [AA01](../sessions/AA01.md)

When the party met their new superior officer, [Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md) placed them in a squad together which they eventually named [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md). He placed his other four subordinates in a squad which they eventually named Ruby Squad.

Through inference, the [players](../../../players/logan.md) likely realise that they are not only competing amongst themselves to stand out, but also against their sister squad.

## Planning

When both squads are given their first missions, Ruby Squad will be given what looks like the more exciting mission, and the one that pays better.

| Squad | Mission | Bounty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md) | [Check Logging in Arnaside](check-logging-in-arnaside.md) | 20 gp |
| Ruby Squad | [Investigate Bear Attacks in Hartsgarth](investigate-bear-attacks-in-hartsgarth.md) | 30 gp |

[Penance Zahiri](../../../astarus/people/penance-zahiri.md) will grin at [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md) when the missions are given out, giving a clear indication of the competitiveness that they feel.

Much later, [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md) will get the opportunity to fight against Ruby Squad in the Autumn Festival's [Kirrel](../../../astarus/gods/gods/kirrel.md) Clash tournament.
