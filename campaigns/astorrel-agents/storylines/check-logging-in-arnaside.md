## Summary

[Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md) tasks [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md) with investigating the logging operations north of [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md). The squad must ensure that logging is proceeding as normal. If there are signs of excessive logging, Bryce expects the squad to return with a list of culprits.

In reality, the people of [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) have not been able to log effectively due to the presence of Kobolds deeper into the [Walna Forest](../../../astarus/places/forests/walna-forest.md) that are laying traps and stealing from the town at night.

## History

## Planning

- [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) is built as a logging and small scale farming town.
- Mostly self sufficient, but uses logging money to buy things it can't make.
- People set up the town to get away from all the problems the kingdom brings.
- They worship [Malnesh](../../../astarus/gods/gods/malnesh.md) at their shrine.
- No inn, only a tavern. Ran by a dragonborn. Party can sleep in the inn overnight, as there's not really anywhere else to stay.
- Poor logging output since the spring.
- Traps left in the forest, several injuries. At least one each: amputation, death.
- [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) rarely visit and are happy to leave them alone.
- Precious supplies going missing in the night.
- Sound of creatures descending on the town. Too scared to act.
- Missing supplies hard to replace due to no wood money. Vicious cycle.
- House of a gnome has been vandalised several times. Gnome has seen them.

Adventure:

- Traps in the forest make finding the Kobolds a pain.
- Delving too deep runs them into a poorly thought out forest ambush.
- Waiting for night leads to a Kobold raid which can be ambushed.
- Kobolds only speak draconic except for the more dangerous ones, which speak common.
- Following them back at night leads to a better prepared and more deadly ambush.
- Entering their burrows/caves is a constant escalating fight with money at the end.

Outcomes:

- Exterminate the Kobolds.
- Ward the Kobolds off by thinning their ranks and/or creating traps for them.
- Empower the townspeople by teaching them to fight or getting better guard presence for the town.
