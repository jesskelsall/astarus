## Summary

[Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md) tasks [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md) with investigating the logging operations north of [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md). The squad must ensure that logging is proceeding as normal. If there are signs of excessive logging, Bryce expects the squad to return with a list of culprits.

In reality, the people of [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) have not been able to log effectively due to the presence of Kobolds deeper into the [Walna Forest](../../../astarus/places/forests/walna-forest.md) that are laying traps and stealing from the town at night.

## History

### [AA02](../sessions/AA02.md)

[Bryce Morton](../../../astarus/people/bryce-morton.md) gives both of his squads their missions at the same time, in each other's presence. [Canary Squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/canary.md) is tasked with heading to [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) and checking on the new logging operation that has started up there, making sure it is proceeding without issue, but not overdoing it. [Ahsha Sallas](../../../astarus/people/ahsha-sallas.md) is made acting [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/ranks/3-squad-lead.md) for this mission due to her receiving the Exceptional Trainee Bonus.

The party heads off under Ahsha's leadership, deciding to head to [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) via the [Coastal Trail](../../../astarus/places/roads/coastal-trail.md). They make their way out of the [Sunset District](../../../astarus/places/districts/sunset-district.md), through the south east gate on the [Northhaven Wall](../../../astarus/places/structures/northhaven-wall.md), and find a stable. After initially looking at buying their own horses which proves too expensive, they decide to hire a coach.

They hire the services of [Clay Mullen](../../../astarus/people/clay-mullen.md), a coach driver, who after haggling with Ahsha agrees to take them to [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) for 5 gp, and will offer the same price for the return journey if they wish.

Setting off, they spend 2 days making their way to [Humouth](../../../astarus/places/villages/humouth.md). During the second day the coach is ambushed by bandits after a dead horse is left on the road, blocking the path, forcing the party to move it. The bandits are dispatched without much issue.

During the fight, Clay is hit by a bandit, rendering him unconscious. For the remainder of the day he rests in the back of the coach while [Ephaine Seren](../../../astarus/people/ephaine-seren.md) drives and [Ahsha Sallas](../../../astarus/people/ahsha-sallas.md) navigates.

Upon arrival at [Howbridge](../../../astarus/places/towns/howbridge.md), the party rents rooms at The Keeper's Reprise for the night, stabling the horse and coach, and ensuring that Clay is put to bed where he can rest.

## Planning

- [Arnaside](../../../astarus/places/villages/arnaside.md) is built as a logging and small scale farming town.
- Mostly self sufficient, but uses logging money to buy things it can't make.
- People set up the town to get away from all the problems the kingdom brings.
- They worship [Malnesh](../../../astarus/gods/gods/malnesh.md) at their shrine.
- No inn, only a tavern. Ran by a dragonborn. Party can sleep in the inn overnight, as there's not really anywhere else to stay.
- Poor logging output since the spring.
- Traps left in the forest, several injuries. At least one each: amputation, death.
- [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox.md) rarely visit and are happy to leave them alone.
- Precious supplies going missing in the night.
- Sound of creatures descending on the town. Too scared to act.
- Missing supplies hard to replace due to no wood money. Vicious cycle.
- House of a gnome has been vandalised several times. Gnome has seen them.

Adventure:

- Traps in the forest make finding the Kobolds a pain.
- Delving too deep runs them into a poorly thought out forest ambush.
- Waiting for night leads to a Kobold raid which can be ambushed.
- Kobolds only speak draconic except for the more dangerous ones, which speak common.
- Following them back at night leads to a better prepared and more deadly ambush.
- Entering their burrows/caves is a constant escalating fight with money at the end.

Outcomes:

- Exterminate the Kobolds.
- Ward the Kobolds off by thinning their ranks and/or creating traps for them.
- Empower the townspeople by teaching them to fight or getting better guard presence for the town.
