## Summary

[Ephaine Seren](../../../astarus/people/ephaine-seren.md) entrusted her star map to her mentor, [Ludolf Hornwallis](../../../astarus/people/ludolf-hornwallis.md), while she graduated. Graduates aren't allowed to have any possessions when they graduate. He agreed to hold it for her and give it back to her after her graduation.

## History

### Pre-Campaign

Before setting off from [Dunmore](../../../astarus/places/cities/dunmore.md) to graduate, [Ephaine Seren](../../../astarus/people/ephaine-seren.md) entrusted [Ludolf Hornwallis](../../../astarus/people/ludolf-hornwallis.md) with her star map. He agreed to return it to her straight after her graduation.

### [AA01](../sessions/AA01.md)

Immediately after her graduation, Ephaine looked around [Kirrel Hall](../../../astarus/places/buildings/kirrel-hall.md) for Ludolf, but couldn't see him.

### [AA02](../sessions/AA02.md)

While the party is ending out their graduation day evening in [The Rose Buckler](../../../astarus/places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md), [Ludolf Hornwallis](../../../astarus/people/ludolf-hornwallis.md) casts Mending to talk to [Ephaine Seren](../../../astarus/people/ephaine-seren.md), telling her that he is in [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md), and to come and find him. He doesn't explain where he is.

When [Ahsha Sallas](../../../astarus/people/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../../astarus/people/redywn-humpledopper.md) go to bed, Ephaine leaves the inn and heads back into the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), looking for her mentor. She decides to check in [Auric Rise](../../../astarus/places/buildings/auric-rise.md), and finds him sat in the lobby's seating area.

Here he explains how he wasn't able to hack attending the graduation ceremony - the promising new talent making him all too aware that his career is about to come to an end, and he wishes he'd been able to gain another promotion before retiring, but that is now unlikely.

Ephaine recognises that he is not in a good place and has been drinking heavily. She encourages him, telling him that there is much good he can do yet. Ludolf tells Ephaine that he enjoys training new recruits, and will continue.

[Ludolf Hornwallis](../../../astarus/people/ludolf-hornwallis.md) gives [Ephaine Seren](../../../astarus/people/ephaine-seren.md) her star map, apologising for not having given it to her earlier. With that, Ephaine leaves.
