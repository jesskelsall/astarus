# Astorrel Agents

*Astorrel Agents* is the second long term campaign set in the [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md) campaign setting.

## Premise

The player characters are freshly graduated members of the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) who go on missions to maintain the balance of nature and the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)'s prosperity.
