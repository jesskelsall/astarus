# Astorrel Agents

*Astorrel Agents* was the second long term campaign set in the [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md) homebrew setting.

## Premise

The player characters are freshly graduated members of the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) who go on missions to maintain the balance of nature and the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)'s prosperity.

## History

### Creation

Astorrel Agents was conceived around November/December 2020 with the goal of providing me with more Dungeons & Dragons, largely as a distraction from Covid-19 developments, and as a spend of my time during England's second lockdown.

After successfully finding players for the [Purple Rain](C1-purple-rain.md) campaign through Instagram's transgender community, I revisited my list of applicants. While the [Purple Rain](C1-purple-rain.md) players were selected from European applicants, Astorrel Agents was North American by contrast. This necessitated scheduling sessions for weekend evenings so that everyone would be available to play.

World building and planning took place that winter, with session zero starting at the beginning of the year. Players were encouraged to create characters that fit the [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md) setting and would fit into the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) military hierarchy as freshly graduated recruits.

### Running

Sessions were ran at 19:00 GMT every other Saturday. This time meant that the North American players were playing around the middle of the day.

Adherence to the schedule was initially very strong, with no missed sessions until I took a break in May 2021 to move house. This time saw [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) 27 used as a way to reduce my planning commitments across both campaigns while still maintaining regular sessions. A gap in sessions happened June/July 2021 following the death of my grandmother.

Towards the end of 2021 sessions were cancelled for various reasons, mostly due to low energy from the players and myself. This continued trend threatened the campaign as I doubted my resolve to push through. Anxiety over whether the next session would even take place made it difficult to plan.

### Player Changes

#### [Brooke](../players/brooke.md) â†’ [Chloe](../players/chloe.md)

Just prior to [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) 27, [Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) were given their next mission. This would see [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) as acting [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) on a mission to investigate [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) / [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) relationships in [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md).

[Brooke](../players/brooke.md) was caught off guard by being placed into a leadership position within the campaign, triggering due to real life parallels. As a result the second half of [AA06](../sessions/AA06.md) was padded out to avoid starting that mission, especially as the tournament was due to start next session.

After discussing concerns and feelings, I encouraged [Brooke](../players/brooke.md) to step away from the campaign for mental health reasons, which they accepted.

I offered a spot on the campaign to [Chloe](../players/chloe.md), who previously missed out on D&D as one of the original [Purple Rain](C1-purple-rain.md) players from its original failed start. She was brought in for an introductory session before the tournament, a meeting that would end up being a whole session ([AA07](../sessions/AA07.md)). After this, [Chloe](../players/chloe.md) as [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) became a regular campaign fixture.

#### [Logan](../players/logan.md) â†’ [Brooke](../players/brooke.md)

Following [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) 27, [Logan](../players/logan.md) did not respond when questioned about attending the next session, and didn't show up at the scheduled time. With [Lily](../players/lily.md)'s help we attempted to reach out to her as we grew increasingly worried about her well being.

While we weren't able to interact with [Logan](../players/logan.md) directly, we observed that she deleted her Instagram account, then eventually left the Overlapping Interests Discord server before deleting her Discord account on a separate date. This suggested a clear wish to disappear and ghost us. Her decision was reluctantly accepted.

With some time since [Brooke](../players/brooke.md) left the campaign, I made an offer to return. [Brooke](../players/brooke.md) and I agreed that creating a new character would be best, so [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) remained shelved, and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) was created to join [AA12](../sessions/AA12.md).

Korina's introduction was dramatic, allowing [Brooke](../players/brooke.md) to integrate quickly as their character came to the party's rescue.

### Ending

As sessions continued to get cancelled from November 2021 into February 2022, my motivation for planning and arranging sessions collapsed. I made the hard decision to discontinue the campaign on 19th February 2022, following a session that I cancelled due to a lack of motivation.

During this announcement I offered one final session to resolve the cliffhanger dragon fight ([What Lies Beneath the Shrine](../storylines/cancelled/what-lies-beneath-the-shrine.md)), but [Brooke](../players/brooke.md) and Billy didn't want to continue following the announcement. The campaign was swiftly shuttered within the next few days.
