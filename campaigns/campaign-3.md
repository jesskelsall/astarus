# Campaign 3

## Ideas

### Session 0

- Ability scores:
  - 3d6 with no re-rolls.
  - Players can trade scores freely to distribute or concentrate power.
- Levels:
  - Asymmetric levels and levelling.
  - Level up earned through individual character progression.
  - Starting level distribution:
    - 2x level 1.
    - 1x level 2.
    - 1x level 4.
  - Either randomly assigned, or given specifically, e.g. Rin level 4, Vika level 1.
- Race:
  - Each person rolls a dice to determine their "race rarity". Likely a d20.
  - Common: Half-orc, tiefling, tabaxi.
  - Uncommon: Dragonborn, goliath.
  - Rare: Kenku, minotaur, satyr.
  - Exceptional: Changeling, leonin, genasi.
- Relationships:
  - Split into two groups, with separate session zeroes to establish their bond and immediate backstory.
