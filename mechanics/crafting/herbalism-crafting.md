# Herbalism Crafting

## Introduction

The mechanics on this page provide supplementary rules for creating items using a [Herbalism Kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/herbalism-kit).

It is adapted from [Herbalism Kit - By Dump Stat Adventures](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/t/611bbeb0cb8c360b0e0fba3d/1629208242929/HerbalismKit_v1-1.pdf) which in turn is designed to replace the rules on *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* page 82.

## Herbalism Knowledge

Owning a Herbalism Kit provides the tools to create natural concoctions and remedies.

### Proficiency

Those who are proficient with a Herbalism Kit start with 3 known recipes and can add their proficiency bonus when creating items.

### Using Recipes

Herbalism items are created by following their recipes. Each recipe requires materials to be gathered from the nearby environment. A Herbalism Kit (Wisdom) check is made to determine if the materials can be found and if so, what potency the item is crafted at. This check is made at disadvantage if the current environment does not match one of the environments listed on the recipe.

Potency determines the "strength" of the item - how effective it is, or how long its effect lasts.

### Fading Potency

Each item created reduces one potency every 24 hours. An item that reduces below Minor Potency no longer provides an effect - it is effectively useless. As a result, Herbalism items should be made when they are needed, rather than attempting to stockpile them.

### Buying Items

Alternatively items may be bought from those selling them, typically at the cost listed on the recipe. Once an item is bought, its potency begins reducing in the same way as a crafted item.

### Learning Recipes

A Herbalism Kit can be used to understand how a herbalism item was created, reverse-engineering its recipe. Make a Herbalism Kit (Wisdom) check, using the recipe's masterwork potency DC. On success the recipe is learned. Regardless of outcome, the item is destroyed in the process.

## Recipes

### Burnsoothe Ointment

**Environments:** Forest, Swamp.

This paste, composed primarily of roots and plant oils, reduces pain and speeds the recovery of burns. If applied to a creatureâ€™s wounds within 10 minutes of their taking fire damage from any source or if applied within 10 minutes at the end of an encounter during which they took fire damage from any source, the creature heals hit points depending on the potency.

|| Minor Potency | Major Potency | Masterwork Potency |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Cost** | 30 gp | 40 gp | 60 gp |
| **Potency DC** | 10 | 15 | 20 |
| **Effect** | 1d6 | 1d6 + 2 | 1d8 + 4 |

### Paralysing Paste

**Environments:** Forest, Swamp.

A paste made from roots of old trees and concentrated poison from ivy. When you smear this on an object and a creature makes contact with it or is hit by it, they must make a Constitution saving throw or become stunned in pain for 1 round. The DC depends on potency. The paste lasts for 24 hours or until it makes contact with a creature.

|| Minor Potency | Major Potency | Masterwork Potency |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Cost** | 20 gp | 25 gp | 30 gp |
| **Potency DC** | 13 | 15 | 18 |
| **Effect** | DC 12 | DC 15 | DC 18 |

### Relaxing Bark

**Environments:** Forest.

Upon burning a certain type of bark & moss in a censor, or by throwing it into the coals of a fire, all those within 10 feet of the smoke find their muscles loosen and their minds relax.
Anyone that allows themselves to relax, and take a short rest, for the hour that the bark burns for automatically regains a number of spent hit dice, but they must remain within 10 feet
of the smoke for the full hour to gain this benefit. They can only regain hit dice if they spend hit dice during the short rest. They regain a number of hit dice depending on the potency.

|| Minor Potency | Major Potency | Masterwork Potency |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Cost** | 30 gp | 60 gp | 90 gp |
| **Potency DC** | 13 | 15 | 18 |
| **Effect** | 1 dice | 2 dice | 3 dice |
