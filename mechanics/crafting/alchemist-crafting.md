## Alchemical Knowledge

Owning Alchemist's Supplies provides vials, burners, flasks and other components needed to create alchemical potions and creations.

### Proficiency

Those who are proficient with Alchemist's Supplies start with 3 known recipes and can add their proficiency bonus when creating items.

### Using Recipes

Alchemical items are created by following their recipes. Each recipe requires materials that must be bought beforehand and represent the material cost per attempt listed in the recipe. When creating items in a town or city with access to alchemical supplies, sourcing these materials is not necessary - simply subtract the cost directly when crafting.

Each recipe takes an amount of time to craft, and states whether the alchemist needs to be present throughout or can leave their supplies alone once the reaction is underway. Regardless, using Alchemist's Supplies is quiet and careful work that requires a distraction-free environment.

At the end of the crafting time, an Alchemist's Supplies (Intelligence) check is made to determine crafting yielded an item and if so, what potency the item is crafted at. 

### Buying Items

Alternatively items may be bought from other alchemists selling them. Typically this will cost three times the material cost due to the alchemist's time investment and the cost of failed attempts.

### Learning Recipes

Alchemists proficient with Alchemist's Supplies can learn new recipes in a few ways:

Firstly, other alchemists can teach their recipes in a matter of minutes by recanting the recipe. Writing materials and two sheets of paper are needed to record the recipe for later use.

Secondly, Alchemist's Supplies can be used to examine an alchemical item and understand how it was created, reverse-engineering its recipe. Make an Alchemist's Supplies (Intelligence) check, using the recipe's masterwork potency DC. On success the recipe is learned. Regardless of outcome, the item is destroyed in the process.

When ingested, one is unable to speak a lie as if they are under the spell Zone of Truth. This takes 3 days to produce one vial, and you have to make the check at the end of every day.
