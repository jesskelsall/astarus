# Nature's Battle

## Summary

Nature's Battle is a combat tournament held each year as part of the [Blade's Rest](../../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival. It sees newly recruited [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads fighting against each other for honour and glory.

## Organisation

Nature's Battle is arranged between the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) General of Culture ([Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md)) and the [Astorrel Commandant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md) ([Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md)), with the former arranging & officiating the tournament, while the latter picks the competing [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads and handles their logistics.

The host city's [Astorrel Captain](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-captain.md) and [Astornox Captain](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-captain.md) are also usually involved to some extent, providing the use of their stronghold and guards respectively.

### Invites

Typically the tournament runs with 8 [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads. Each is selected from that year's [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) graduates, allowing newly recruited [Astorrel Squad Hands](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) and [Astorrel Squad Leads](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) to make a name for themselves.

Each squad receives a letter from the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) General of Culture, personally inviting them to take part. They are free to decline if they wish. Confirmation must be made in writing.

### Logistics

The tournament itself takes place in an arena, traditionally [Vorrinel's Stand](../../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) in [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md). As the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads can be based anywhere in the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), travel arrangements are made to bring them to the hosting city. Where possible the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and/or [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) arrange for magical teleportation for the competitors, sparing them the time and danger required for over-land travel.

Competitors are provided accommodation in the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) stronghold of the host city, with their well being catered to for the duration.

### Arena

The arena itself is typically circular, 60-80ft in diameter, with a small piece of full height cover placed at its center to provide some strategic cover.

## Format

Nature's Battle is a **single elimination tournament**. This means that after each match, the losing squad is eliminated from the tournament while the winning squad advances to the next round. Ultimately a final match is played to determine the tournament's winner.

Each match sees two [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads fight each other in a four versus four combat battle, in the arena in front of a spectating audience, as well as the officials present.

## Rules

| Character Rule | Player Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Each team must have an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md), in rank or acting. | If there is no [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) in the squad, the DM will pick someone to fill this role for the entire tournament. |
| Preparations for battle cannot be made unless it is impossible to make them during the heat of battle. | Abilities that take 1A or 1BA must be activated during initiative order, unless they specifically provide benefit to initiative rolls. |
| A team is picked to guess the coin flip. The winner picks which side of the arena their team starts on. | The DM chooses a squad lead to guess whether a d6 will roll an odd or even number. |
| Both squads have a brief moment before the match starts to huddle and strategise. | Separated into different Discord voice channels, each squad is given 5 minutes to strategise in secret (planning phase). |
| The squad's starting spots must be picked in secret before the match starts. | Four hex flowers (7 hex squares in a circle) are drawn on each side of the arena, acting as numbered starting spots. During the planning phase the squad lead must send a private message through Discord to the DM that assigns each squad member to a numbered starting point. |
| Before the battle begins, a small amount of movement is tolerated. | After initiative is rolled, the first round of combat is reserved for making up to 5ft of movement on the hex grid. This allows fine adjustments to be made to each character's starting position. |
| Squads are expected to go all out when fighting each other. | Players need not worry about dealing non-lethal damage and should instead focus on treating combat like a fight to the death. |
| Attacking unconscious competitors instantly disqualifies your team, ending the match. | A character that is unconscious due to health loss cannot have damage dealt to it willingly. This is to substantially reduce the likelihood of character deaths. |
| Unconscious competitors will be given medical attention and moved out of harm's way by [Astorrel Members](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) positioned around the arena. | [Astorrel Members](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) are placed at initiative 1. When they see a character fall unconscious they will use their turn to approach them, cast Spare the Dying, and drag them to the edge of the arena. |
| Unconscious competitors that regain consciousness may continue to fight. | A character that is brought out of unconsciousness due to healing may continue to fight. They remain in the initiative order throughout. |
| Competitors that leave the arena may no longer participate. | The arena boundary is clearly demarcated on the battle map. |
| The last squad standing wins! | The last squad to have at least one of its members conscious wins the match. |

## Prizes

## Significance

### To Competitors

Competing [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads are typically honoured to be invited to take part. With modern [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) graduate cohorts numbering around 100, being one of the 32 selected to compete conveys at least the perception of being better than their remaining peers.

Showing ones combat prowess in such a public space gives each [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) a chance to make a name for themselves, whatever they take that to mean. It is also an excellent opportunity to show what you can do in front of some of Astor's top officers, particularly the [Astorrel Commandant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md).

Similarly, winning is the ultimate show of ability. This can potentially have as much value to a competitor as the more tangible prizes. Your superior officers remembering that your squad won Nature's Battle can have lasting benefits throughout your [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) career for those wishing to climb the ladder.

### To the Public

The people of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) enjoy watching a good fight, with pit fighting allowed in some cities in the kingdom. The Nature's Battle tournament is the premier fighting tournament for spectators. Betting on the outcome of each match, selling food & accommodation provides many in the host city with a spike of income.

With many [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) present at the [Blade's Rest](../../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival, watching the tournament is an opportunity to see what the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) are made of, with many sizing up whether they'd be able to take a given squad in a straight fight.

For most of the public, knowing [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) is uncommon enough, let alone witnessing one use the full extent of their magical ability in anger. Many tickets are bought by people who wish to see magic that is spectacular and unknown to them, giving the tournament an uncomfortable zoo feel to many of its competitors.

## History

The Nature's Battle tournament took place for the first time in 285 P.A., one year after the Astor-Syntenne War armistice agreement was signed. It was started as a way to lift public spirits and as a PR stunt to try and convince more people to join the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

The early years of the tournament were characterised by a lack of proper rules, arena, or large audience. As the tournament matured it became formalised, growing in popularity as it did.

### Death

Initially death was an accepted part of the tournament. Due to its nature as an all out combat "sport", death and disfigurement was present but uncommon.

Over the years attitudes towards this shifted, with measures put in place to try and prevent death in the arena. The inclusion of a rule banning any attacks against an unconscious competitor, and the [Astorrel members](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) ready to provide medical aid, helped bring the tournament's relationship with death to a freak occurrence.
