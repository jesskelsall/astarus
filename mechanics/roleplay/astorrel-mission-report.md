# Astorrel Mission Report

## Summary

*See: [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md)*

As part of completing a mission for the [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md), the [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) for the squad must make a written report which is handed to their superior, typically an [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md).

When completed by a player, the act of making a report follows the mechanics outlined here.

## Mechanics

- Completed in private: only the DM and the player writing the report are present.
- All mechanics are explained up front.
- The player is asked not to tell other players of the *specific mechanics*.
  - They may role play telling others what the report needed to contain, and what they wrote.

### Mission Outcome

The report starts with what happened on the mission, and what its outcomes are.

- Write as much or as little as you want.
- Each separate point of relevance requires a persuasion or deception check, at the DM's discretion.
  - Determines how convinced their superior is.

### Squad Performance

The report ends with specific appraisals for each [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) and the [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) themself. The player gives their first-hand impression of how each squad member performed on the mission.

- Each character is assigned a dice from the following pool: d12, d10, d8, d6.
- The more sides on the dice, the better the appraisal.
- The player is allowed to choose the d12 for their own character.
- For each character:
  - The character gives a brief appraisal.
  - The dice is rolled.
    - If the mission was a success, roll with advantage.
  - The roll result is modified by the character's persuasion or deception modifier.
- The *relative scores* are used by their superior to learn who is performing best.
