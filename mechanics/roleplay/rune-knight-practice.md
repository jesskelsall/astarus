# Rune Knight Practice

## Summary

*See: [Torbra's Giant Lineage](../../storylines/torbras-giant-lineage.md)*

As a Fighter (Rune Knight), [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) must practice the runes that she learns before becoming able to apply them to weapons and armour at will.

## Materials

In order to practice, writing supplies and paper is needed. Alternatively Smith's Tools and a weapon / set of armour can be used for practice.

It takes 30 minutes per attempt.

An attempt can only be made on a paper / weapon / armour once. The presence of the attempted rune, successful or not, gives no room for another try.

## Skill Check

With the material components present, a Dexterity skill check is made.

- The DC is initially 20.
- Each failed attempt reduces the DC by 2.
- The DC increases by 1 with each long rest, up to the original DC.

This applies per rune. Practice of one rune does not affect the DC of another.
