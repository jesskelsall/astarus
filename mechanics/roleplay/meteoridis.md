# Meteoridis

## Summary

Meteoridis is an affliction in humanoids propagated by [the Meteorics](../../lineages/the-meteorics.md). It primarily affects a person's mental faculties, making them sympathetic to [the Meteorics](../../lineages/the-meteorics.md) themselves.

## Prerequisites

- Touch a [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) that still contains [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md)'s enchantment magic.
- Fail a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw.

## Immediate Effect

The affected creature becomes unconscious for 1d4 hours. They can be woken up early if someone else touches the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) that afflicted them with Meteoridis.

## Visions

During the creature's initial unconsciousness and periodically while asleep thereafter, the creature will receive visions that enforce the mental effects of Meteoridis. They include the following elements:

- The stars and searching for meteors amongst them.
- One or more meteors streaking across the sky.
- The sky glowing one colour (between white and purple), fully saturated with meteors at a closer look.
- The colour purple.

## Compulsions

Any creature with Meteoridis feels the following compulsions to some degree:

- Strong and ever-present desire to remain as close to the grey material as possible.
- Checking the night sky for meteors.
- Attraction to the colour purple.

## Scaling Effects

The effects of Meteoridis lead to behaviour which can worsen its effects, such as ingesting [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). These heightened effects can become permanent with repeated abuse.

## Cure

Meteoridis is a curse. It can be broken with Remove Curse or other curse cleansing methods.
