# Two Truths and a Lie

## Summary

As part of [AA01](../../sessions/AA01.md) the [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/C2-astorrel-agents.md) players were given two truths and a lie about various characters in their [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) graduate cohort, including the other [Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) members.
