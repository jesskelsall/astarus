# Three Legged Race

The three legged race is a festival game played for fun in teams of two.

Two teams of pairs of characters have one of their legs tied to the other person's. Both pairs then race a short distance in a test of coordination and ambition.

## Rules

Over the length of the race, skill checks are made to determine whether the pairs are able to run in tandem, or fall over as they go.

The winner is the first pair to cross the finish line.

### The Course

The three legged race takes place on a straight 100 ft (30 m) long, with a finish line demarcating the other side. The pairs are dashing (sprinting) along the course.

### Moving

Each turn both pairs attempt to run along the course. Both pairs make Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks:

| Results | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Difference > 10 | Falling Over |
| Difference > 5 | Risk of Falling Over |
| Otherwise | Pair moves (lower score x 2) ft along the course. |

### Risk of Falling Over

The pair must make Dexterity saving throws, DC 8.

| Results | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Both fail | Falling Over |
| One failure | No movement |
| No failures | Pair moves (lower score) ft along the course. |

### Falling Over

The pair fall to the ground, ending their turn.

On their next turn they must attempt to stand back up before continuing. Attempting to do so takes their entire turn. The pair make Strength saving throws, DC 5. If both succeed they stand back up. If either fail they remain on the ground.
