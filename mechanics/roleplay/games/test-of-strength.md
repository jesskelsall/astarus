# Test of Strength

The test of strength is a festival game played for fun by individuals.

The goal is to hold as many bags of sand as possible, a test of both raw strength and endurance.

## Rules

The player is given a large wooden box weighing 20 lbs to hold with both arms. Into this sandbags are placed, steadily increasing the weight of the box.

## Starting

The player picks up the 20 lb wooden box.

## Adding Weight

Sandbags weighing 40 lbs are added to the box one at a time. If the total weight of the box and sandbags is less than the player's lift encumbrance they are able to carry the total weight without issue.

If the total weight exceeds their lift encumbrance, the player makes a Strength saving throw, DC 10. On success they manage to keep holding the box. On failure they are forced to put it down and accept defeat.

After succeeding the Strength saving throw, the next save is +3 DC. This process can repeat as many times as the player is able to meet the DC.
