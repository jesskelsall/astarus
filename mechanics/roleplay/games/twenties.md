# Twenties

Twenties is a dice game that is played as a form of gambling. It is played with the same d20 and d6 dice that Dungeons & Dragons is played with.

It originates from the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) and is typically played in inns.

It is typically played with two [players](../../players/logan.md) who compete against each other, though it could be played with more [players](../../players/logan.md) easily. It is possible for the game to end in a draw, though unlikely.

## Rules

The winner of Twenties is the player who produces a score of 20, or whoever is closest to it.

### Order of Play

Each player completes the following steps:

1. Roll a d20.
1. Optionally, choose how many d6 to roll. Declare how many you will be rolling before continuing.
1. Add the values on all dice together to get the player's score.

All [players](../../players/logan.md) complete step 1 at the same time before [players](../../players/logan.md) take turns completing steps 2 and 3.

### Determining a Winner

The winner is determined by the following ordered criteria:

1. A player that rolls a natural 20 wins, unless multiple [players](../../players/logan.md) did (draw).
1. The player whose number is closest to 20 wins (e.g. 18 beats 16).
1. The player who rolled the least d6 wins (e.g. 22 with 1d6 beats 22 with 2d6).
1. The player with the lowest number wins (e.g. 19 beats 21).
1. Draw.

## Gambling

Twenties is typically played with money to provide interesting stakes.

All [players](../../players/logan.md) agree on how much each player will stake (typically 1 sp or 1 gp). Coins are placed on the table before the game begins. The winning player takes the pot.

In the event of a draw, each player adds the same amount to the pot again or forfeits. Another game is then played.

Optionally, [players](../../players/logan.md) may agree to raise the stakes after everyone has rolled a d20.
