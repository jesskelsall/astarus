# Iron Stomach

Iron Stomach is a festival game played for fun against another player.

The goal is to out-drink the other player. The first to pass out or refuse to drink loses.

## Intoxication

For the purposes of this game, getting drunk follows rules adapted from [Drinking (5e Variant Rule)](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Drinking_(5e_Variant_Rule)).

A character's intoxication threshold is their Constitution score + 1. The strength of drink contributes to their intoxication score.

If their intoxication score ≥ their intoxication threshold they are considered drunk.

If a character drinks after exceeding their intoxication threshold they must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC is equal to 8 + the strength of the drink + their exhaustion level.

| Result | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Pass | No effect. |
| Fail | Gain 1 level of exhaustion. |
| Fail ≥ 5 | Fall unconscious for 1d4 hours. |

## Rules

Two players sit opposite each other on a small table.

Four drinks of differing strengths are provided, each with an associated point value. Once all four drinks are consumed, a new set of the same four drinks are provided.

The players take turns choosing a drink and downing it.

| Drink | Strength |
| --- |:---:|
