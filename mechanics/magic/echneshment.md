# Echneshment

## Summary

Echneshment is a school of magic. Based on the magic of [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md), it is about infusing inert materials with the memories of others so that it may act on its own without further instruction, guidance, or magical influence.

Created in [Oonar](../../planes/oonar.md) through a close bond with [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md), echneshment is now largely a forgotten art. Only the items already empowered with memories remain.

## Examples

### [The Meteorics](../../lineages/the-meteorics.md)

Created by [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md) herself with the assistance of [Kaldoon](../../gods/deities/kaldoon.md), [the Meteorics](../../lineages/the-meteorics.md) are a dark fine gravel ([meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md)) come to life with [Kaldoon](../../gods/deities/kaldoon.md)'s knowledge of battle tactics.

### [Memory Spheres](../../items/artifacts-of-oonar/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md)

[Memory spheres](../../items/artifacts-of-oonar/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) use echneshment to collect memories from the surrounding area and collect them for future access. Their design is condusive to the storage and recollection of the memories stored within, without the sphere itself acting upon the memories.

### [Unevaire](../../items/artifacts-of-oonar/weapons/unevaire.md)

[Unevaire](../../items/artifacts-of-oonar/weapons/unevaire.md) was formed using echneshment, infusing the blade with a person's memories of the glow of the moon.
