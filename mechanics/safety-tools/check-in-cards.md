X, N, and O cards are check-in tools. They can be used by tapping physical cards, typing the letter in the chat function of the video conference software or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand signals. Before the game begins, remind everyone that they are available and how to use them.

| O | [ST-C-1](../../papers/cards/ST/ST-C-1.md) | Green | Can be used at any point if a participant wants to continue with the content.<br>When used, the group is okay to continue with the content. |
