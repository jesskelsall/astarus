# Open Table Policy

*Adapted from "Open Door". Source: [TTRPG Safety Toolkit](https://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1583202183294.pdf)*

> The Open Table Policy is the assurance that someone can leave or take a break from the game for their own safety and well-being without being judged. State this at the beginning and periodically throughout the game.
>
> The game will continue in their absence. This will allow the player to return when the game has reached a point where they feel comfortable doing so.
