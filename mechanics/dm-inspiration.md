# DM Inspiration

## Summary

Inspiration is a mechanic that allows the DM to reward players during the course of a session. It can be used to aid their player characters in their goals.

## Awarding Inspiration

Inspiration can be given to players at any time in order to reinforce positive behaviour or actions. Some examples:

- Good roleplaying.
- Responding to pre-session roleplaying prompts.
- Correctly answering pre-session recap questions.

## Using Inspiration

Inspiration follows the D&D 5e inspiration rules which allows inspiration to be used to grant advantage on any skill/attack/saving roll.

As such, inspiration needs to be applied **before** rolling. It is not a free re-roll.

The advantage granted by inspiration conforms to the typical advantage & disadvantage rules. As a result, using inspiration on a roll to be made with disadvantage cancels out the disadvantage.

### Table Rule: Inspire Others

A player cannot use their inspiration on their own character. Instead they grant inspiration to another character at a moment of the inspired player's choosing. It must be called out before the roll is made.

The inspired player's character and the inspired character must be able to see or hear each other.

The inspired player needs to roleplay how their character inspires the other.

## Losing Inspiration

At the end of the session, all unused inspiration is lost.
