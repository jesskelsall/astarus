# Inspiration Pool

## Summary

The inspiration pool is a table rule used to make granting and using inspiration more meaningful.

## Inspiration

Inspiration is a mechanic that allows the DM to reward players during the course of a session. It can be used to aid their player characters in their goals.

### Awarding Inspiration

Inspiration can be given to players at any time in order to reinforce positive behaviour or actions. Some examples:

- Good roleplaying.
- Responding to pre-session roleplaying prompts.
- Correctly answering pre-session recap questions.

### Applying Inspiration

Inspiration follows the D&D 5e inspiration rules which allows inspiration to be used to grant advantage on any skill/attack/saving roll.

As such, inspiration needs to be applied **before** rolling. It is not a free re-roll.

The advantage granted by inspiration conforms to the typical advantage & disadvantage rules. As a result, using inspiration on a roll to be made with disadvantage cancels out the disadvantage.

## Inspiration Pool

### Pool Tally

When inspiration is awarded it is given to the table, not the individual. Inspiration can be accumulated, so a tally needs to be kept of how many uses of inspiration remain in the pool. For in-person games this can be represented by a container containing d20s - ideally a glass of some sort.

This pool of inspiration persists between sessions. The DM will keep track of the tally and record it at the end of the session. This tally is then used from the start of the next session, with players being reminded of its count.

### Using Inspiration

As long as there is a non-zero tally of inspiration in the pool, any player at the table can consume one use of inspiration to inspire **another character.** This must be done before that player rolls.

The player granting inspiration must role play how their character inspires their target. This will typically require that both characters are within visual and/or verbal range - it is not possible to inspire a character that your own character cannot interact with, or is not aware of the actions being performed that correspond to the roll.

### Encouraging Use

To prevent players from trying to accrue initiative without using it, the DM should make it clear that inspiration will not be awarded in sessions following one where no initiative was consumed.
