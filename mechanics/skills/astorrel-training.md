## Description

> Your [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) Training check measures your ability to recall your training on how to safeguard the balance of nature and civilisation within the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md).
>
> Your modifier represents the quality and comprehensiveness of your training by your mentor(s), and was determined in session zero by a d20 roll. Your Intelligence modifier is then applied.

## History

### [AA04](../../sessions/AA04.md)

This skill was added to the [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents.md) party's character sheets before [AA04](../../sessions/AA04.md). In addition to the INT modifier, a modifier was added that was determined by a d20 roll during [AA00](../../sessions/AA00.md). This was then converted using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table (PHB p173).

It was suggested that those with negative d20 modifiers in particular would improve their skill over time through application of study. This would be manually adjusted as part of the homebrew nature of this skill.

| Character | INT | INT Modifier | d20 Roll | d20 Modifier | Proficiency Bonus | Total Modifier |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | 10 | +0 | 4 | -3 | | **-3** |
| [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | 13 | +1 | 7 | -2 | | **-1** |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | 8 | -1 | 8 | -1 | +1 (half proficiency) | **-1** |
| [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | 15 | +2 | 16 | +3 | | **+5** |

### [PR21](../../sessions/PR21.md)

The skill was added to the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain.md) party's character sheets following [PR21](../../sessions/PR21.md). In addition to the INT modifier, a modifier was added that was determined by taking the lowest result of four skill checks. This provided an extremely high likelihood of a negative modifier which reflects the party's rushed [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) training.

Like with the [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents.md) party, the idea is to remove some of the negative modifiers over time as the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain.md) party gains experience in the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).
