## Summary

Blade's Rest is a festival that takes place over 3 days, 2 at the end of Taledus, and 1 at the start of Shavdor. It celebrates the transition from a month of [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) to a month of [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md).

## Significance

Blade's Rest is an autumn festival. As the weather in [South East Kardan](../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md) begins to cool, the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) armies that are deployed in higher regions make their way towards the coast as the winter snows start to set in. These armies are put on a period of rest, hence the festival's name.

It is also a harvest festival. The year's crops have been harvested and the cattle are slaughtered to last through the harder winter months. This is celebrated with sumptuous feasts.

Soldiers are afforded the opportunity to share their stories of glory and triumph during Blade's Rest. Those eager to prove themselves worthy of the stories they tell do so in ceremonial combat.

## Events

### [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md)

As the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) promote their newest recruits in Finsbock, a month of [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md), one of the main draws of Blade's Rest is the [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) tournament. This is held every year in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md)'s arena, [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md).

[Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads from the latest intake are invited to take part in [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md), travelling to [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) to fight in front of a large audience of [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), citizens, and drigg alike.

The event is hosted by [Liabella Peacock](../characters/liabella-peacock.md), [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) General of Culture, with the assistance of [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md), [Astorrel Commandant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md).

Squads battle each other in a knockout tournament, 4 vs 4. Aside from glory and fame, the winning squad receives the favour of the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) and a prize purse of 1,000 gp in platinum coins.
