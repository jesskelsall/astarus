## Summary

[Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) tests [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) in a dream, making her choose between himself, [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md), and [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md).

## Details

[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is back in the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), lying on the floor in the meteor crater, bathed in a purple glow. She recognises this as the place and time where she became unconscious after throwing herself on the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md).

She's not able to move, but she is able to look around her. She sees the rest of her party fighting 3 [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), locked in tense combat, bloodied and fighting for their lives, on the verge of death.

From the corner of her vision comes her deva, [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md). He is bathed in golden-white light that doesn't interact with the surrounding environment. Gracefully he walks over to her, wings outspread, then kneels before her and offers her a hand.

Saoirse chooses to try to reach out to him. Some feeling and movement returns to her fingertips and then her hand and arm, allowing her to reach out to him. As their hands touch, a radiant warmth overtakes her, freeing her from her paralysis. [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) helps her up.

As she observes the frantic battle around her, she feels disconnected from it, with little sound in her ears. She is more focused on her deva, standing next to her.

Beyond all of this on the opposite side of the cave, she also sees her hag patron, [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md), surrounded in an ominous spectral glow that also doesn't interact with the scenery. She stares at Saoirse disapprovingly, lowering her head without breaking her gaze. As Saoirse looks back at [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md), he shakes his head slowly several times.

Saoirse falls backwards, banging her head on the ground. As she picks herself back up, the scene has changed. She is positioned in the center of the meteor crater between the one remaining [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), clearly injured but ready to continue fighting, and her party. The watcher looks through her, focused on the party beyond.

Over the watcher's left shoulder she sees Effie. Over its right is [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md). Saoirse must decide what to do next.

| Action | Meaning | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attack the watcher with conventional means. | Deva positive. | [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) sees a willingness to be saved, an easier task. |
| Attack the watcher with warlock magic. | Warlock patron positive. | [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) sees an unwillingness to be saved, an uphill struggle. |
| Leave or protect the watcher. | Meteoric positive. | [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) sees a corruption by [the Meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md), a different struggle altogether. |

She chooses to draw her daggers and attack the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md). As she gets up, she notices glowing wings attached to her back, matching those of her deva. Suddenly all of her worldly worries melt away as she is filled with a pleasant warmth.

As she draws her draggers they begin to glow, casting a golden-white light across the nearby crater. The [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) recoils for a moment before lunging towards her. She stabs with both daggers, causing it to begin cracking with white light, until it explodes into [Meteoric Dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) which flies across the crater.
