## Summary

[Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) and [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) give [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) a dream that shows her how powerful [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) is because her [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) essence is free from corruption.

## Details

She feels uncomfortably warm, like her skin is on fire. She opens her eyes, finding herself lying on her side on the arena floor in [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md). She watches as in slight slow motion the events of [Mortar Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) vs [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) play out. The events transpiring are those that took place while she was unconscious mid-fight.

Saoirse is unable to move, frozen in place but able to look with her eyes. As her skin continues to burn from [Diarmuid Kavanagh](../characters/diarmuid-kavanagh.md)'s fire that knocked her out, the burning subsides, replaced by a pleasant cooling sensation. The gravel around her begins to be illuminated with white-yellow light as the glowing hand of [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) reaches down into her view, offering it to her. She looks up at him but struggles to fight against his radiant light.

*[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Who the fuck are you?

As she asks this, she grabs his offered hand. The moment she does, the light grows more intense, blinding her.

Once again she finds herself lying on the arena floor, this time with her head throbbing from blunt force trauma from [Norma Collarbone](../characters/norma-collarbone.md)'s Skipping Stone impact. The events of [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) vs [Gloom Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md) are now playing out in a similar level of slow-motion.

At one point in this sequence, the scenery is replaced with that of [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), and each member of [Gloom Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md) is replaced with a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), while the events of the arena continue to play in this guise. The cave itself is bathed in purple light. After a brief moment of this, the scene snaps back to the arena.

The gravel once again is illuminated by white-yellow light. As Saoirse looks up she sees [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) gliding down towards her with her Radiant Soul wings. When she lands, the wings envelop Saoirse on the ground. Thanea's glowing eyes stare back at Saoirse, a knowing smile breaking out on her face as she offers her hand. As Saoirse touches it, the dream ends instantly.
