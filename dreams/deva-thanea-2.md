## Summary

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) is given a dream by [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md), hinting to the location of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) and warning of the dangers that come with finding it.

## Details

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) is on the outskirts of [Goldreach](../places/settlements/towns/goldreach.md), near to where she arrived in town. It is night, with a clear star-filled sky. She can see the stable, buildings and streets not far ahead, but it is eerily silent and devoid of life.

Looking up she sees a familiar sight - a meteor streaking across the sky, from the top right to bottom left, getting closer and leaving a white trail behind it.

She looks closer and sees a giant round rock hurtling through the sky, but there is no trail - instead she sees a figure bathed in white light, the opposite of silhouette. They are pushing against the meteor with both of their arms and head, while their legs attempt to brace, even though they're hurtling through the sky. They have large feathered wings, also bathed in light, flapping as they go, attempting to propel them into the meteor.

As the meteor and figure hurtle past, the meteor crashes down to the earth with an audible thud and a bright flash of light, briefly blinding Thanea and lighting up the sky as if it were day. Smoke begins to rise from the other side of town.

Thanea is now in the forest, searching for the meteor. It is still dark and she stumbles about, searching impatiently. She comes across burning trees and feels she is going the right way, pressing on through them.

She emerges into a large crater, 200ft wide. Its basin is empty but surrounded by burning felled trees from the blast. Sliding down into the crater she finds the large meteor at its centre - a large 6ft diameter rock. As she approaches it the flames around the crater intensify and begin burning purple rather than orange. She runs back into the forest.

The entire forest is now on fire and she is struggling to breathe as she runs. Every tree and felled log is painted purple with flames. Due to the flames and smoke she loses her way.

Turning around she finds herself in [The Slippery Weasel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md). It too is filled with smoke and on fire. The chairs, tables, bar and ceiling beams are all covered in purple flames. The room is full of bodies, melted flesh and exposed bone a testament to the severity and heat of the fire.

Running out of the inn she pushes the door open and enters the barn that they are staying in that night. The barn is also on fire, purple flames around the entrance that are quickly spreading down the barn as she desperately searches for her companions. Amongst the pigs she can't find them, but after a while of searching, all the while the flames grow, she finds them.

They are huddled against a wall, arms wrapped around each other for protection. On closer inspection they are already dead, their skin melting like candle wax, sliding off the bones and bubbling as it goes.

The smoke gets to Thanea again as it fills the room. She passes out next to her friends
