## Summary

All three [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) share their first dream together, showing the ritual they must perform together at [Augury Rock](../places/topography/landmarks/augury-rock.md).

## Details

### [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)

Thanea finds herself in the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) by day, a pleasant grassy bowl shaped valley with the sun on her face. The sun is setting to the west, just about to disappear over the top of a hill, beginning to cast long shadows on the hills to the east.

To the east, where the shadow of one hill meets another behind it, she sees a glowing figure with wings ([Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md)), fixed in place and looking disconnected from its surroundings. She can't seem to figure out how or why they're in this location, close to the peak of the hill behind it.

Thanea tries walking to get closer but it feels endless, with no visible progress made. Instead she uses Radiant Soul and unleashes her radiant wings, taking flight towards the figure. She closes the distance almost instantly, flying at a speed considerably faster than she is used to. As she arrives the figure unfurls their own set of radiant wings, flying at speed further up the ridge of hilly peaks, stopping at the next, looking at Thanea.

Thanea continues to give chase, the same series of events playing out on repeat. Each time the figure moves to the next peak, the pair ascending the hills as they become snow topped and mountainous. Eventually the figure stops at a notable peak on this section of the ridge, with the tallest peak visible in the background up ahead. As Thanea approaches, her entire vision grows bright and fades to white.

### [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md)

Saoirse finds herself in the streets of the [Sunrise District](../places/settlements/districts/sunrise-district.md) of [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md), searching for [Ethel's Wares](../places/buildings/shops/ethels-wares.md) amongst the streets near the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md). She turns a corner onto what she knows is the correct street, but as she approaches the shop front, she finds it to be a different building, as if the shop had never existed.

She turns around, trying to double-check where she is, but as she does so she finds herself several streets away again, her position reset. She tries with extra determination to reach the shop again, but the same situation plays out several times in a row, a loop that she cannot break.

After a few tries she instead decides to turn around, checking what is along the street in the opposite direction. As she does, she sees a radiant yellow-white figure ([Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md)) peering at her from around a street corner. She gives chase, following them through the winding streets. Eventually they come to a market square in the shadow of the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md), with the figure now on the other side of it. She continues to give chase, racing after them.

Turning the next corner, she sees the figure through the wall's gatehouse, waiting for her on the other side. She tries to push through the queue of citizens having their [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md) checked by [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) manning the gatehouse, but the harder she pushes through, the further back in the queue she seems to be, the gatehouse growing further away. Then she notices the figure in the corner of her eye, down an alley to her left. She leaves the queue to pursue them once again. As she does the figure turns the corner and disappears out of sight. As she rounds that corner herself, her vision fades to white.

## Thanea, Saoirse, and [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)

All three [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) then share a dream sequence with each other. Each dreams of virtually identical things in unison.

Each person finds themself in the middle of a desert sandstorm, with deep drifts of sand moving underfoot and poor visibility in every direction. Not far ahead they catch glimpses through the storm of their deva, wings outstretched, standing and facing them.

Saoirse walks forward, buffeted by the wind, but the closer she gets, the more she can make out her deva [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md). The more she looks at his face, the less detail she sees, the radiant glow masking his features entirely. Similarly Thanea walks forward towards her deva [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md), using her own radiant wings to shield herself from the blowing sand.

[Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) reaches out with both hands, both palms face up and fingers outstretched in front of her, waiting for Thanea to take action. [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) reaches out with a single hand, palm face up, cupped slightly and pointed in Saoirse's direction. Both Saoirse and Thanea place their hands in the palm of their deva's.

Thanea watches as the bright all-encompassing radiance begins to spread from [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md)'s hand onto her own, moving along her arm and down her body. Its brightness is similar to staring into the sun, a reverse silhouette that masks all detail and makes only the outline of her body perceptible.

Saoirse initially has the same experience, but a competing inky blackness begins to rise from her feet, covering her legs and waist in a similar darkness that blocks out all details. The pair meet in the middle of her arm and settle for a moment before the darkness continues its ascent, overtaking the radiance, racing along her arms until it reaches her fingertips. Saoirse and [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) are still touching hands, but the darkness is confined to Saoirse's body.

Saoirse opens her mouth to speak but her words get lost in the sandstorm.

Both Saoirse and Thanea are lead by the hand by their devas deeper into the sandstorm. After a moment the pair emerge from the sandstorm suddenly, entering the eye of the storm, an area of desert devoid of wind. In its centre is [Augury Rock](../places/topography/landmarks/augury-rock.md), a prominent rock set into the sand at a slight angle, some smaller desert rocks supporting it on its highest side. Amongst these smaller rocks is a dead tree, battered and gnarled by the desert storms.

Glancing across the area, both notice each other, about 200ft away, 1/3 of the way round the edge of the eye of the storm, with the swirling vortex of sand behind them. They both see radiant glowing winged creatures leading each other by the hand. They then both look further round and see a third figure bathed in a radiant glow ([Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)), being led by a similar radiant figure with wings ([Minsas](../characters/minsas.md)).

Each person's deva leads them over to [Augury Rock](../places/topography/landmarks/augury-rock.md), letting go of their hands as they reach its edge and take their first step onto it. Thanea hesitates, looking back at [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) who doesn't react. She then goes ahead, stepping further onto the rock. Saoirse moves round the rock to Thanea and grabs her hand, the pair proceeding further onto the rock together.

Allisa reaches the centre of the rock and stops, stretching both of her arms out, one at each of the others. At this range both can now make out her appearance, particularly her full-face metal helmet. Both grab a hand each, forming a triangle with their arms, each person holding the hands of the other two with their arms outstretched.

A radiant warm comes from deep within each person, spreading out across their bodies with an intensity that begins to hurt, while their exterior glows brighter by the second. Saoirse's dark exterior begins to turn radiant white, overcome by the radiance within her. As it does she feels true radiant warmth for the first time.

In the centre of their arms, a pillar of light begins to swirl and raise, a miniature tornado of radiant energy that rises high into the sky. As it does the sandstorm on the edges of the area begins to pick up speed, swirling faster and faster with an audible whine that rises in pitch as it goes.

Suddenly the pillar of light turns from radiant white to jet black, continuing to swirl in place but with a necrotic energy instead. As it flips, the world switches from day to the middle of the night, the entire desert around them darkening to reflect this. All of the wind present in the sandstorm stops in an instant as every grain of sand continues its trajectory, swirling for a moment as it all collides with the ground.
