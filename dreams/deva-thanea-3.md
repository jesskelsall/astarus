## Summary

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) is given a dream by [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) of an attack on [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) by [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) in the coming winter.

## Details

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) is in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md), on a city centre street. The road is narrow and packed with people. The buildings are tall and foreboding, hastily built wherever they fit.

The weather is cold, and is getting towards sunset.

Looking up, she spots a white light in the sky. Looking closer, she notices the streaking tail of a meteor. It gives the impression that the meteor is heading roughly in this direction, but off to one side.

From the corner of her vision she sees a flash of light as a figure darts into the sky in the direction of the meteor. They are bathed in white-yellow light, with similarly glowing wings.

Another figure streaks into the sky from her left, to meet a second meteor which Thanea hadn't initially noticed. It is clear now that two figures are approaching two meteors.

Both figures impact the meteors, a flash of white light erupting from the impact. After a moment a booming rumble reaches ground level. Thanea sees them both struggling against the meteor, flapping their wings, attempting to resist their descent.

The people around her have started to look up, point at what they see, and become panicked and begin running. The street scene erupts into chaos.

Looking up again, Thanea sees a third meteor, larger than the other two, heading directly towards her. She panics, turning to run away. She looks back several times, seeing the meteor again each time. The second time she does this, a stranger shoulder barges her, forcing her to the ground. Now lying on her back, she looks up at the meteor, watching it as it grows in size from its approach. Another stranger steps over her, forcing their foot into Thanea's stomach as they attempt to step over her.

Thanea gets up and observes the meteor again. As it gets closer, its white trail and glow turns purple, enveloping it in purple flames as it continues its descent.

She tries to wake up, recognising that she may be dreaming, but is unable to. Unsure of what to do, she cowers, covering her face and bracing for the worst.

Suddenly Thanea feels a tap on her shoulder. As this happens, the sound of her surroundings fades away to a dull murmur. Looking for who tapped her, she looks up and sees [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) (her deva), her facial features unknowable and with her wings folded away. He offers Thanea her hand, palm face up. Thanea offers her hand in return.

*[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md):*
> Who are you?

[Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) doesn't reply, but Thanea is able to comprehend a smile on her formless face. She looks up at the large meteor, unfurling her deva wings. Suddenly the pair are hurtling into the air in an instant, the ground below them shrinking rapidly as they ascend at a scarcely believable pace. Thanea screams her heart out.

Thanea looks down and observes the city and its surroundings. She sees a river, with a tightly packed walled city next to it, near to a river delta, where the river meets the sea.

Looking up, the meteor gets increasingly close. Thanea looks down and notices a second set of flapping wings, identical to those of [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md). They are her own. Looking over to [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md), her palm is still outstretched in the same way as it was offered, with Thanea's hand on top. [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) retracts her hand, separating the pair. She drifts away, both Thanea of them continuing their ascent.

Thanea looks up once more and starts to panic, thinking too hard about her first flight, and starting to lose control. As she does, the dream ends.
