## Summary

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) is given her first deva dream by [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md), pointing to the nearby town of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to investigate the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) that just landed there.

## Details

Standing in a field south east of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) at night, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) can see the geographical surroundings of the town - forest to the east and west, mountains to the far north, and grassy plains in between.

She notices a meteor streaking across the sky, travelling down and left, leaving a white streak as it goes, continuing to accelerate.

It crashes down near the western forest, emitting a blast of white light so bright that for a moment it appears like day. After it subsides, flames can be seen rising from that area, the light from which creates silhouettes of the town in front of it.

Suddenly it begins to get foggy as smoke begins to encircle [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md). It grows thicker until she can see nothing, and as she breathes it in she loses consciousness, waking from the dream.
