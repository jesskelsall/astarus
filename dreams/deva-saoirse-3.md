## Summary

[Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) and [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) give [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) a dream of how powerful she would be as an [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) with [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s powers, from Thanea's perspective.

## Details

[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) dreams of an alternate version of events in [The Dog's Groke](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md), during [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s battle with the [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md), formally [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md).

Her dream takes place through the eyes of [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md). She watches the events of the fight unfold, including the initial struggles, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) passing out, and Torbra pulling the creature into the hall before getting blasted into the opposite room.

The dream progresses to the point where Thanea is on the floor of Slaine's room unconscious. Saoirse sees through her eyes, observing the battle developing around her. Suddenly she witnesses a radiant figure with glowing eyes and wings enter the room. They rush over to her, leaning down and looking into her eyes before offering a hand. Saoirse realises that she is looking at a version of herself where she has the same [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) powers as Thanea.

Saoirse willingly takes her own hand, allowing her to move her body and focusing her vision. The hand raises her to her feet before she realises what is happening. Radiant Saoirse gives a grin before pulling out her daggers. A radiant glow forms on the surface of the metal as she readies them, before she charges out of the room toward the creature, a clash of puncture wounds heard from through the door.

Saoirse's vision fades to white as the dream ends.
