## Summary

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s death in the jaws of a giant crocodile shocks her [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) mates and sends shockwaves through everyone that knew her.

## History

### [PR35](../sessions/completed/PR35.md)

While swimming out into the [Humar Meteorite Crater](../places/rivers-lakes/humar-meteorite-crater.md), a giant crocodile appears from the depths below [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), surfacing to bite her. It connects, doing her great damage and pulling her underwater. When she tries to escape it knocks her unconscious with its tail. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) swims into the lake to defend her. She is able to use her Stone Rune to subdue the crocodile, giving her a chance to pull [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) to the shore.

[Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) tries to summon radiant wings but is only able to summon her usual Necrotic Shroud, frightening [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and preventing her from acting quickly in support of Torbra and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).

As Torbra pulls [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) to the shore, the crocodile regains its mobility and swims over. It makes a large bite at [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), snapping her torso while spinning her around, killing her. Her lifeless body splashes into the water. Saoirse blasts the crocodile away but it is able to circle back and take [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) from Torbra who pulled her body ashore.

As the crocodile swims back into the lake with her body, Torbra and Thanea do their best to destroy it, but aren't able to land a killing blow. It makes off for the depths, disappearing from sight.

Distraught by the death of their friend, the party regroups and works through their anguish. [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) expresses his regret at not being able to do anything to help, but Saoirse and Thanea reassure him that it is okay. Torbra finds [Wizira's Staff](../items/wiziras-staff.md) on the shoreline, taking it to the party, clutching it like a sacred artifact.

### [PR36](../sessions/completed/PR36.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) return to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) to inform [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) that they are now unable to complete their mission ([Investigate the Humar Meteorite Crater](ended/investigate-the-humar-meteorite-crater.md)).

Elysia initially swears when [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) breaks the news to her, but otherwise doesn't react poorly. During debrief she calls [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s death "unfortunate", angering [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) who dislikes her cold attitude. Elysia tells them that [Astorrel squad hands](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) do die in the field occasionally.

With the failure of their mission, Elysia worries that Phenomena / Meteoric may get dissolved, but if she retains her role as [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) she will acquire [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s replacement, bringing the squad back up to four members.

Before the squad begin two days of downtime between missions, Elysia provides [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) with a letter ([PR36-L-1](../letters/PR36-L-1.md)) addressed to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md). Torbra swears when she reads the name before pocketing the letter.
