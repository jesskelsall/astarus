## History

### [PR30](../sessions/completed/PR30.md)

Following the completion of [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s first mission ([Talk to the Morning Chasers](talk-to-the-morning-chasers.md)), [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) debate which of the four offered missions to take next. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) as [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) makes the decision to head to the Humar Estuary. This is partially motivated by its quick mission deadline and relatively high ratio pay.

### [PR31](../sessions/completed/PR31.md)

#### Day 1

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) gear up for their mission to the Humar Estuary. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) considers how they might get there, first considering hiring a horse and cart before deciding to try and buy a rowing boat.

The party head to the west of the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md), down to the docks lined with ships of all sizes conducting commerce. She finds several businesses that will sell her a boat for 50 gp. As an alternative she looks for a ship that might be willing to drop them off along their route.

Torbra finds [Dinua Costello](../characters/dinua-costello.md), captain of [the Maiden's Accompaniment](../places/ships/the-maidens-accompaniment.md), who is willing to transport them for 1 gp each (4 gp total). The party agree to the arrangement which will include them sleeping on the deck and jumping overboard once the ship is close to the Humar Estuary.

#### Day 2

On a day filled with heavy rain, low hanging clouds and gusting winds, around mid-morning the party jump overboard as instructed, plunging into the surprisingly deep and murky water below.

While [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) manages to hold her breath and re-surface with ease, everyone else begins to drown. She soon finds and rescues [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md). [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) begins to drown and is losing consciousness fast, while [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is out of breath but successfully swims to the surface herself. Quick thinking by Thanea to cast Light on her rope and lower it into the depths catch Saoirse's eye. Thanea and Torbra manage to pull Saoirse to the surface.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) uses Wild Shape to turn into a fish, making her way to land. The rest of the party follows her, struggling through the reeds and boggy terrain for a while before reaching relatively dry and firm ground.

### [PR32](../sessions/completed/PR32.md)

Now on dry land, the party realise that they have no idea where to go next. With no discernible landmarks except for a few trees and the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) behind them, they decide to take shelter under a large tree nearby, dry their clothes, and wait for the rain to pass.

After several hours the rain is not letting up but their clothes are drier. When [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is trying to figure out which direction to go next, [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) pulls out her [Meteoric Map of Astor](../papers/maps/meteoric-map-of-astor.md) and realises that it has been ruined by water damage. Torbra decides the party should head south west.

Travelling for most of the day, the party eventually see disturbances in the water ahead. As they get closer they begin to make out [Leithran Shack](../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md) through the rainy mist. They hear [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) shouting for help fighting off crocodiles and rush to help. They are able to save Montel from death at the hands of a crocodile thanks to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s Healing Word, and fight off the rest of the crocodiles present in the water around the shack.

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md)

In order to get onto Humar Estuary by land, [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) will need to pass through Fort Eldrick. The [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) stationed there do not like the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and their incessant coming and going. It will be a challenge to even get onto the estuary.

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) will be able to find the [Humar Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md) crater on Humar Estuary. It is much larger than the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) crater, suggesting a larger [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). The crater is waterlogged and very deep.

A larger [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) can be found at the bottom of the crater, showing the same cracks as the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). There is no sign of any creatures.
