## Summary

The [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) is built on a lie: [The Arrival](../../history/events/the-third-coming.md) brought the first humanoid races to [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md). The [Astornos](../../organisations/government/astornos.md) work diligently to enforce this origin story, particularly where elves are involved.

## History

### [AA11](../../sessions/AA11.md)

When reporting a potential [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spy conspiracy to [Legacy Aranius](../../characters/legacy-aranius.md) and [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md), [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) hear Legacy order [Tanin Arnous](../../characters/tanin-arnous.md) to fetch a Truthseeker.

### [AA12](../../sessions/AA12.md)

When [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) plus [Yialdred Korina](../../characters/yialdred-korina.md) exit the [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers with [Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md) as their prisoner, they emerge up the sewer ladder into the basement of an inn, passing through an Arcane Gate. Here they meet [Gwenhwyfar Carew](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md), calling herself "[Nia](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md)" to protect her identity. She reveals that she is an [Astornar](../../organisations/government/astornar.md) Truthseeker and the person that they are supposed to be delivering Xavier to, not [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md).

[Nia](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) acts as a friend to the bewildered party who are extremely suspicious of her. After she asks them what happened in the sewers and what they know, to which they reply honestly, she asks them to set Xavier down against a large cask of ale so she can talk to him. [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) is wary of [Nia](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md), warning her against killing him.

[Nia](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) asks for Xavier's cooperation in [elvish](../../languages/elvish.md) before casting Detect Thoughts on him, reading his thoughts and memories. Through this she learns of everything Xavier told [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) in the sewers, and his and [Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)'s goals in [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md).

She chastises the party for how much they know, calling it a complication, and referring to loose ends, before executing [Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md) by casting Disintegrate on him. The mood in the room goes sombre and [Nia](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) drops her kind demeanour.

The party are threatened implicitly with the same fate if they don't cooperate. [Nia](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) makes it clear that they will leave this place and never speak of what happened today, as if the events never happened. [Nia](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) makes it exceptionally clear that the presence of [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spies within the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) threatens the [Astor-Syntenne War](../../history/events/astor-syntenne-war.md) armistice agreement, and that what she is doing allows the continued peace & prosperity not possible while actively at war - particularly the [Blade's Rest](../../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival currently taking place.

[Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and Korina reluctantly agree to her terms, leaving via another Arcane Gate. With the dramatic execution of their prisoner and nothing more to show for their day's effort, [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) give up the hunt for spies, going about the rest of their day. Korina goes back to her guard duty.

### [AA17](../../sessions/AA17.md)

While exploring the [Devdaha Crypt](../../places/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md), [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) come across the body of a long dead elf, few signs of their lineage, age, or origin apparent. Their clothing is unfamiliar and heavily decayed.

Amongst their possessions they find a [Grievous Weapon](../../items/magic/enchantments/grievous-weapon.md): Dagger that [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) takes. Additionally [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) finds four [Chausain platinum coins](../../items/coins/chausain-platinum-coin.md), pointing to the body's origin - an early elf of [the Second Coming](../../history/events/the-second-coming.md) who explored this place not long after arriving on [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md) from Chausain. The only information they can glean from the coins is that the writing on them is in [elvish](../../languages/elvish.md), recognised by [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md). She reads the words "PLATINUM" and "CHAUSAIN", a word she does not understand at all.

### [AA18](../../sessions/AA18.md)

After [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) manage to escape the chalice trial in [Devdaha Crypt](../../places/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md), they decide to rest and sleep off their injuries. On second watch both [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) stay up together. During this time they talk about the nature of the crypt. Ephaine expresses her ominous feelings about a place that feels incongruent to her understanding of the world, its age not marrying up with the [timeline](../../history/timeline.md) of [The Arrival](../../history/events/the-third-coming.md) as the origin of all intelligent life on [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md).

## Planning

This storyline served as an opportunity for the [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/C2-astorrel-agents.md) campaign to challenge the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)'s revisionist history, potentially seeing them rebel against the military if they so wished.

[Gwenhwyfar Carew](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) would have been a recurring character on this journey who would attempt to stop the party from revealing the truth. Keeping away from her watchful eye would have been a challenge in itself.
