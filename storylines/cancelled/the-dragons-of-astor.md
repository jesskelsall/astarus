## Summary

After meeting dragons on two occasions, questions are raised as to whether there are still dragons on [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md).

## Planning

This storyline would have seen the [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/C2-astorrel-agents.md) campaign investigate the existence of dragons on [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md), taking them to distant and inhospitable lands in search of the elusive beings.

Prior to this, the existence of dragons has been hinted at and revealed:

| Event | Storyline | Dragon(s) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting [Ikra](../../characters/ikra.md) in the [Blue Kobold Cave](../../places/caves/blue-kobold-cave.md). | [Check Logging in Arnaside](../ended/check-logging-in-arnaside.md) | [Cheorrosdyr](../../characters/cheorrosdyr.md) | [Blue Kobolds](../../lineages/blue-kobold.md) created by this dragon and worship her.<br>Not learned by the party. |
| Combat with dragons at the end of [Devdaha Crypt](../../places/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md). | [What Lies Beneath the Shrine](what-lies-beneath-the-shrine.md) | [Deorvys](../../characters/deorvys.md)<br>[Fraevuth](../../characters/fraevuth.md) | Not completed.<br>Kill or be killed, with no opportunity to discuss. |
| Meeting a golden dragon to return to the present day. | [Call of the Strigid](call-of-the-strigid.md) | *Elder Golden Dragon* | Not started.<br>Opportunity for discussions. |

[Kleachanshtojak Yrlyassa](../../characters/kleachanshtojak-yrlyassa.md), the [Astorrel Major](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-major.md) of Dragons, would have taken [Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) under her wing and set them upon the task of learning more about the dragons. This would have seen the party working semi-autonomously on missions that interested them, much like [Starfall Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md).
