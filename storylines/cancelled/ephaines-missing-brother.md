## Summary

[Tamman Seren](../../characters/tamman-seren.md), [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md)'s older brother, left his [Filisur](../../places/villages/filisur.md) home suddenly around 6 months after Ephaine left herself. His parents have no idea where he went or why exactly.

## History

### [AA14](../../sessions/AA14.md)

[Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) encounters [Bluefoot](../../characters/bluefoot.md) in [Gate to the West](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) in [Blittergate](../../places/towns/blittergate.md). [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) recognises that he knows her name, seeing him glance at her and linger his gaze for longer than anyone else at the table. This freaks her out, causing her to encourage her squad out of the building. She covers her tracks by paying for two rooms for the night, but once outside tells the party that they must leave immediately.

Sensing her discomfort, [Bluefoot](../../characters/bluefoot.md) and [Weldira Cobblecase](../../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) leave the inn, standing in the street as [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) take their horses and wagon north towards [Filisur](../../places/villages/filisur.md).

### [PR42](../../sessions/PR42.md)

While in [Blittergate](../../places/towns/blittergate.md), [Starfall squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) meet [Weldira Cobblecase](../../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) and [Bluefoot](../../characters/bluefoot.md). They get to talking about the other [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad that passed through several days ago ([Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)). Weldira asks if they know the names of the squad members, to which Torbra is able to provide the full names of: [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md), and [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md).

Weldira and [Bluefoot](../../characters/bluefoot.md) discuss amongst themselves Ephaine, her name coming as a revelation. [Bluefoot](../../characters/bluefoot.md) tells Weldira "younger sister", having learned about her from [Tamman Seren](../../characters/tamman-seren.md) directly.

[Starfall squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) doesn't understand the context of their discussion and they don't ask.

### [AA16](../../sessions/AA16.md)

When [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) arrive in the [Albulain Valley](../../places/plains-valleys/albulain-valley.md) in search of [Kiln squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md), [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) leads them to the [Seren Farmstead](../../places/buildings/houses/seren-farmstead.md), keen to reunite with her family and secure the party somewhere safe to stay while in the area.

She meets her father, [Schaef Seren](../../characters/schaef-seren.md) who is ecstatic to see her again and keen to meet her strange & gifted colleagues. When Ephaine asks if everyone else is okay, Schaef explains that [Tamman Seren](../../characters/tamman-seren.md) isn't here any more. Ephaine fears the worst but Schaef assures her that he isn't dead, though he did leave home suddenly. Ephaine chalks it up to wanting to strike out on his own, a coming of age moment. Schaef explains that [Besar Seren](../../characters/besar-seren.md) and [Irla Seren](../../characters/irla-seren.md) are here and safe, as is her mother, [Adalie Seren](../../characters/adalie-seren.md).

Adalie is cold to both Ephaine and the party, still unhappy with the punishments Schaef endured after Ephaine left, and an increased disdain for the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) military in any form. She voices her upset that Ephaine wears an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) military badge, telling her that a badge is badge, even if she's not [Astornox](../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md). Ephaine defends her actions, telling her that she had no choice in order to survive as a [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) running from the [Astornox](../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md).

Ephaine learns that Tamman only left recently and without warning, having been instrumental in restoring the flock before that.

## Planning

[Tamman Seren](../../characters/tamman-seren.md) left [Filisur](../../places/villages/filisur.md) to join the [Astornox](../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md), no longer willing to stand by and watch his home village get oppressed. On his way south he met [Bluefoot](../../characters/bluefoot.md) who told him of his role as an [Astornox Magicborn Hunter](../../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md). When Tamman expressed interest, [Bluefoot](../../characters/bluefoot.md) pointed him to [Hyceodd](../../places/towns/hyceodd.md).

In [Hyceodd](../../places/towns/hyceodd.md) Tamman joined the [Astornox](../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md). He was moved to Eaglesfield for training. Due to his persistence and will to become a [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter, he recently joined the organisation provisionally, despite not being [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) himself.

This storyline would have seen [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) search for his brother, slowly realising that he joined the military organisation that is responsible for oppressing the [Cepine](../../lineages/cepine.md).
