## Summary

[Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) is pulled into the distant past by [Nallu](../../characters/nallu.md), a [strigid](../../lineages/strigid.md) who cast [Wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish) on his deathbed. Meeting the [strigid](../../lineages/strigid.md) provides Ephaine with clues to the nature and history of the startouched, and the challenge of returning home.

## Planning

This storyline was intended for [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/C2-astorrel-agents.md) and would have followed on from [What Lies Beneath the Shrine](what-lies-beneath-the-shrine.md).

Following the defeat of [Deorvys](../../characters/deorvys.md) and [Fraevuth](../../characters/fraevuth.md), an inscription on the back wall of the final chamber of [Devdaha Crypt](../../places/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md) would have served as the trigger for [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) to be transported to the distant past, 113,805 years ago, before [The Second Coming](../../history/events/the-second-coming.md).

In real life, a separate session would have been conducted with [Lily](../../players/lily.md) and Beth, her wife, which would have encompassed Ephaine's entire time in the past. Her return the following session would have allowed her experiences to affect the party's direction, prompting them to investigate the existence of powerful dragons ([The Dragons of Astor](the-dragons-of-astor.md)) and/or the incongruence of history between her experiences and what the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) teaches ([Enforcing Astorian History](enforcing-astorian-history.md)).

As this storyline approached, I changed my plans, instead planning to have the entire party transported back to [Devdaha](../../places/villages/devdaha.md). This was for practical reasons - one less session would need holding, and it was looking unlikely that I could get extra time from [Lily](../../players/lily.md).

The storyline would have seen the party make friends with the [strigid](../../lineages/strigid.md), who had never seen the party's races before, and travel to a nearby golden dragon lair to have it send the party back to the current day. Before departing, [Nallu](../../characters/nallu.md)'s magical staff would be gifted to Ephaine, later sought by [Nilliski](../../characters/nilliski.md) ([Nilliski's Unknowable Whims](nilliskis-unknowable-whims.md)).
