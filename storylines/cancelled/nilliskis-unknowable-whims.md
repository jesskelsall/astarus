## Summary

[Nilliski](../../characters/nilliski.md) has a secret agenda that involves using [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) to manipulate the [Schiller family](../../organisations/schiller-family.md) into doing their bidding.

## History

### [AA10](../../sessions/AA10.md)

After [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) reads the letter given to him ([L-AA-02](../../letters/L-AA-02.md)), [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) appears to nudge Noon towards claiming the [free Schiller steel](../ended/free-schiller-steel.md) weapon for one of his new [Astorrel squad hands](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md).

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> Aww, I think he's the one that's soft! I was beginning to think that father didn't love you. I don't think you need his charity, do you [brother light](../../characters/noon-schiller.md)? Though I'm not too sure about your new friends...

Noon hints to [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) that he may be able to procure a [Schiller steel](../../items/schiller-steel.md) weapon, asking them what type of weapon they would like.

Later when Noon leads the party to [Schiller Steel Eskrigg](../../places/buildings/shops/schiller-steel-eskrigg.md) and unsuccessfully tries to convince [Callum Briar](../../characters/callum-briar.md) to let [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) have a [Schiller steel](../../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe for free, [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) reappears to cryptically suggest showing the letter to him in order to prove that [Bernard Horace Schiller](../../characters/bernard-horace-schiller.md) has authorised the free weapon.

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> Well, it's a shame, but the pen is mightier than the sword!

Noon doesn't pick up the meaning, instead opting to leave the shop for now.

### [AA12](../../sessions/AA12.md)

When [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../../characters/yialdred-korina.md) emerge from the [Eskrigg](../../places/settlements/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers and leave the custody of [Gwenhwyfar Carew](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) via a second Arcane Gate, they take a collective moment to decompress and consider what to do next.

While [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) is pacing, [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) appears, leaning against the wall. She is initially silent until Noon uses Awakened Mind to converse with her.

*[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Any ideas [Sister Shadow](../../characters/nills.md)?

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> Well [Brother Light](../../characters/noon-schiller.md), I think this one is even beyond me.

Noon audibly tuts out of frustrated dissatisfaction.

Later, after [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) returns to [Schiller Steel Eskrigg](../../places/buildings/shops/schiller-steel-eskrigg.md) to retrieve the [Schiller Steel](../../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe for [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) appears to ponder the eventual fate of [Callum Briar](../../characters/callum-briar.md), the shopkeeper who fears for his life:

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> [Brother light](../../characters/noon-schiller.md), do you think father will take his life, or will he will do it to himself first? Place your bets!

*[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> To be honest dear sister, after today I neither know nor care.

[Nills](../../characters/nills.md) chuckles.

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> Well answered.

### [AA13](../../sessions/AA13.md)

When [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) recants her backstory and mentions not knowing what will await her in [Filisur](../../places/settlements/villages/filisur.md), [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) chimes in with a cryptic note for [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md), suggesting she knows what will be found there:

*[Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> ...so I'm not sure what's going to be waiting for me there.

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md), appearing to [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) nearby:*
> What indeed.

During the night while Ephaine takes watch with Noon, [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) appears again, talking about Ephaine:

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> She's just a child. Don't let the badge fool you.  
> I think before long that part of her life will be behind her.

*[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> We shall see, dear sister.

While riding into the bottom of the [Tresenda Pass](../../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) valley, [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) appears on the draft horse in front of Noon, speaking of destiny, alluding to [Nills](../../characters/nills.md)' knowledge of what awaits the party in [Filisur](../../places/settlements/villages/filisur.md):

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> [Brother light](../../characters/noon-schiller.md), do you believe in destiny?

*[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I try my best not to.

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> A fair answer. And what about this lot, what do you think?

*[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I hope they'll be fit for purpose.

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> For once I'm not speaking of us.  
> There's something out here in these mountains. I think it's only a matter of time until we find it.  
> Will you play your part?

*[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Indeed dear sister.  
> Have I ever failed to in the past?

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> Not yet brother, not yet.

### [AA16](../../sessions/AA16.md)

When [Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) arrives in the [Albulain Valley](../../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/albulain-valley.md) in search of [Kiln Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md), [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) leads them towards the Schaef Farmstead, using her knowledge of her home village to guide them. [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) can be seen to [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md), walking alongside Ephaine for around an hour, exploring the area with her.

That evening the party head up to the Shine to the Stars, led once again by Ephaine, at the suggestion of [Schaef Seren](../../characters/schaef-seren.md). Once there they look upon the ancient standing stones, curiously trying to figure out their nature while Ephaine rediscovers this place of power that she was once familiar with.

[Nills](../../characters/nills.md) can be seen investigating herself, respectfully observing each stone without touching it, slowly pacing around the area. When Ephaine asks the party to stand back while she tries something, [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) moves close to her side, wanting to get the best view possible of whatever happens next.

As Ephaine looks up and views the archer constellation, something arcane changes around the shrine. [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) voices her lack of knowledge to Noon:

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> What was that?

*[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Aren't you supposed to be the one to know these things?

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> Yes [Brother Light](../../characters/noon-schiller.md), but there are limits to even my knowledge. When I come across those limits, I look for answers.

*[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I can think of no better way to react.

When Ephaine activates Starry Form: Archer to activate the shrine, [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) stays close to her, wanting to get the best view possible. Noon follows [Nills](../../characters/nills.md)' lead until Ephaine begins glowing, stepping back to let the magic at play work without disturbance.

### [AA17](../../sessions/AA17.md)

While [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) rests in [Devdaha Crypt](../../places/structures/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md) outside of the door to the chalice trial, [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) is on watch while everyone else sleeps. [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) appears to him, intentionally positioning himself between Noon and the doorway.

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> So [Brother Light](../../characters/noon-schiller.md), what do you make of all of this?

*[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Intriguing.

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> Quite the understatement, don't you think?

Noon shrugs, dismissive of the question, suggesting it is his usual nature to understate.

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> Well... good luck with what lies ahead.

[Nills](../../characters/nills.md) stands and slowly walks backwards, passing through the stone door. Noon smirks before getting back to his watch.

## Planning

[Nilliski](../../characters/nilliski.md) was pushing Noon towards helping [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) discover and battle through [Devdaha Crypt](../../places/structures/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md), already knowing that its end would see Ephaine transported backwards through time, returning with a magical staff. [Nilliski](../../characters/nilliski.md) through [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) would then get Noon to take it for himself in order to unleash [Nills](../../characters/nills.md)' full power.

The plans for this storyline were heavily reliant on
