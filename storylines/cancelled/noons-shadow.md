## Summary

[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) can call upon a shadowy figure that resembles him. Who is "[sister shadow](../../characters/nills.md)", and why does she refer to him as "[brother light](../../characters/noon-schiller.md)"?

## History

### [AA13](../../sessions/AA13.md)

While fighting gnolls that ambushed [Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) during the night on their journey to [Blittergate](../../places/towns/blittergate.md), [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) calls upon [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) by casting Summon Shadowspawn, asking for her help in combat. The entire party sees [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) for the first time and hears Noon conversing with her:

*[Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I think we could do with your help on this one [sister shadow](../../characters/nills.md).

*[Nills](../../characters/nills.md):*
> Yes of course [brother light](../../characters/noon-schiller.md), it would be my pleasure.

As instructed, [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) arrives with a piercing scream that frightens many of the gnolls and [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md). [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) runs off into the dark to confront the gnoll pack lord but proves less useful than expected in dispatching him.

### [AA14](../../sessions/AA14.md)

Immediately following the defeat of the gnolls, [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) emerges from the darkness with bright white eyes. She takes a bow towards [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) before disappearing into smoke on the wind.

[Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) interrogate Noon on the nature of her shadow, particularly bothered that he has this ability but hadn't felt it pertinent to mention it yet. Ahsha strongly encourages him to share what he can do so the squad can rely on his abilities, but Noon tries his best to placate them with assurances that he is in control of the shadow and she is on their side as long as Noon is. This is of little comfort to Ephaine.

Noon explains that the shadow is part of her and always has been.

The following night while camping by the road, Ahsha takes second watch. During it she asks Noon more about the shadow, wondering if it is always around them. Noon remains tight lipped, suggesting he doesn't know how the shadow came to be. It is clear to Ahsha that Noon doesn't like talking about the subject as he stiffens up when questioned.

### [AA15](../../sessions/AA15.md)

When [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) asks [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) whether he even needs to sleep, Noon replies that he doesn't, explaining it as one of the benefits of having his shadow.

## Planning

At a later date when the stakes were high and the situation bleak, particularly if only [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md)'s life was in danger, [Nills](../../characters/nills.md) would have appealed to the rest of the party directly.
