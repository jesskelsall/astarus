## Summary

[Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) are natural rivals, with the same superior officer in [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md).

## History

### [AA01](../sessions/AA01.md)

When the party met their new superior officer, [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) placed them in a squad together which they eventually named [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md). He placed his other four subordinates in a squad which they eventually named [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md).

Through inference, the [players](../../../players/logan.md) likely realise that they are not only competing amongst themselves to stand out, but also against their sister squad.

### [AA02](../sessions/AA02.md)

Upon arriving back at [Bryce Morton's Office](../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md) the following day, [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) size each other up, seeing what they have spent their money on. [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) reveals that both [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) have both received the Exceptional Trainee Bonus, using this as justification for making them both the first acting [Astorrel Squad Leads](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md).

Both squads begin their first missions:

| Squad | Acting Lead | Mission | Bounty | Time Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) | [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) | [Investigate Bear Attacks in Hartsgarth](investigate-bear-attacks-in-hartsgarth.md) | 30 gp | 10 days |
| [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) | [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | [Check Logging in Arnaside](ended/check-logging-in-arnaside.md) | 20 gp | 14 days |

## Planning

[Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) will get the opportunity to fight against [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) in the Autumn Festival's [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Clash tournament.
