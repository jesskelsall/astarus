## Summary

[Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) are natural rivals, with the same superior officer in [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md).

## History

### [AA01](../sessions/AA01.md)

When the party met their new superior officer, [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) placed them in a squad together which they eventually named [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md). He placed his other four subordinates in a squad which they eventually named [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md).

Through inference, the [players](../../../players/logan.md) likely realise that they are not only competing amongst themselves to stand out, but also against their sister squad.

### [AA02](../sessions/AA02.md)

Upon arriving back at [Bryce Morton's Office](../places/buildings/bryce-mortons-office.md) the following day, [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) size each other up, seeing what they have spent their money on. [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) reveals that both [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) have both received the Exceptional Trainee Bonus, using this as justification for making them both the first acting [Astorrel Squad Leads](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md).

Both squads begin their first missions:

| Squad | Acting Lead | Mission | Bounty | Time Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | ---:| --- |
| [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) | [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) | Investigate Bear Attacks in Hartsgarth | 30 gp | 10 days |
| [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) | [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | [Check Logging in Arnaside](ended/check-logging-in-arnaside.md) | 20 gp | 14 days |

### [AA06](../sessions/AA06.md)

When [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) return to [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) for their second mission, Bryce hands them the [Nature's Battle Canary Squad Invite](../papers/letters/natures-battle-canary-squad-invite.md). He tells them that the same invite to [Nature's Battle 27](ended/natures-battle-27.md) has been extended to [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md), a point of pride for him. Knowing that they are competing factors into [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)'s decision to compete.

On their way out of [Auric Rise](../places/buildings/auric-rise.md), [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) spots [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) entering [the Mission's End](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-missions-end.md). Wanting to spend more time with him, she splits from the party and follows him inside. Here she finds the rest of [Ruby squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md), who tell her of their successful mission to Hartsgarth where they killed several brown bears in a den near the village. They also briefly discuss their invite to the tournament, which they are excited to accept.
