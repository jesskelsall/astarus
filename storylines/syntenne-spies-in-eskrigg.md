## Summary

[Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) Veritacris have infiltrated [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md). [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md), and [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md) are searching for another [Aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md), and they think they may have found one.

## History

### [AA10](../sessions/AA10.md)

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) enter the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers in order to clear out hostile rats so that [Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md) can set up an underground pit fighting ring. While fighting rats, the party find the bloated corpse of [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md), which washes down a sewer tunnel toward them.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) turns the corpse over to find a bloated humanoid dressed in destitute rags. She finds no obvious cause of death.

After combat, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) further examines the body, finding some coin and an [Astorrel Lieutenant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-lieutenant.md) badge. The party initially suspects the body was that of an [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) officer, but when Ephaine notices their half-elven ears, the body makes even less sense.

Back on the surface, the party reconvene with Barthon who is disturbed by the sight of the corpse. He pleads with the party to walk away, ominously implying that they are about to get involved with something they would rather not. This only causes them to double down for more information.

Barthon tells them that a [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spy ([Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md)) infiltrated his pit fighting ring before it was shut down. He helped his leader ([Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)) extort him into aiding them, threatening to harm his family, particularly his daughter, if he did not comply. To keep his family safe he did as he was told.

Barthon provided the spies with information about the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), but most notably information about the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)'s customs and culture. He tells the party that he was surprised that while their geographic knowledge of [South East Kardan](../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md) is stellar, they know almost nothing about the kingdom's culture.

He reveals that the section of sewer that he asked the party to clear out was in fact for the spies' use. This angers the party, now implicated in a Syntenne conspiracy against their knowledge. Barthon is sympathetic but ultimately felt he had to protect his family, who he has already moved to [Mockerkin](../places/towns/mockerkin.md) for their protection. The party debates what to do with him before telling him to leave [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) immediately and be with his family.

The party debate what to do with the corpse. They agree that they must report this to the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) as per their military duties.
