## Summary

While visiting [Shrine to the Stars](../places/structures/shrine-to-the-stars.md) near her home village of [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md), [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) discovers the entrance to [Devdaha Crypt](../places/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md). What secrets does this ancient, danger-filled place hide?

## History

### [AA16](../sessions/AA16.md)

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md), encouraged on by her father [Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md), leads [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) up the hills to the east of the [Seren Farmstead](../places/buildings/houses/seren-farmstead.md), arriving at the [Shrine to the Stars](../places/structures/shrine-to-the-stars.md). Knowing this place to be a place with the best views of the stars, she shows [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) how the standing stones align with the stars above. The sky is crystal clear, owing to the presence of a crystal dragon lair nearby.

Ephaine searches the stars, finding herself drawn to the archer constellation which is reaching out to her. As she notices this, [Pajaru](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) sends a pulse of his energy to the shrine, allowing the secret passageway to be accessed. Ephaine, Noon, and Korina all sense this arcane change in the area, as does [Nills](../characters/nills.md) who wonders aloud what it is to Noon, not knowing precisely what this place holds.

Ephaine activates her Starry Form: Archer, allowing her to see and interact with the staircase set into the intact horizontal standing stone. She begins to step into it, everyone else seeing her feet pass through solid stone. She encourages everyone to follow, the party tentatively making their way through what they perceive as stone, though with her Starry Form active, they are able to pass through it. Once inside, they can see clearly through the standing stone's underside, a view of the starry sky beyond it.

They follow the staircase down into the first room, the Archer trial. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) steps into the room, triggering a Guiding Bolt trap that strikes her in the chest. This makes the party wary of where they stand. Ephaine casts Misty Step to teleport to one of the staircases, observing the skeletons of the early [Cepine](../lineages/cepine.md) who settled [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) after [the Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md), buried with short bows which they clutch, even in death.

Ephaine casts Detect Magic, spotting an abjuration aura on the skeleton underneath a decaying cape in the middle of the room, and another magical trap in front of the stone door at the other side. On this door she sees points of light that match the archer constellation. As her Starry Form fades, the points of light vanish. She casts Dispel Magic to disarm the trap before going over to inspect the body. Her, Noon, and Ahsha find it to be human-like, wearing cloth fineries and buckled leather straps, not matching the skeletons set into the crypt's walls.

Ahsha moves to the wall to look for a missing skeleton. As she ascends the stairs on the right hand side of the room she triggers all 12 of the skeletons there to rise, readying their bows for combat.

As the early combat ensues, Ephaine uses her spectral archer to shoot at the door, fulfilling all conditions for the door to open. It begins to slide downwards slowly. The party begin to fight off the skeletons from that side of the room.

When Korina uses Channel Divinity: Turn Undead, many of the skeletons on both sides of the room are destroyed instantly, but this has the effect of waking those that remain on the other side. They begin to drop down into the central area, targeting her specifically as the fight continues.

### [AA17](../sessions/AA17.md)

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) continue their fight against the reanimated skeletons inside the archer trial room. They are able to dispatch all of the skeletons without difficulty.

Deciding to take a short rest, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)'s Starry Form: Archer soon ends, causing the door on the far side of the room to raise quickly and slam shut, the conditions no longer met for it remaining open.

The party investigates the body in the middle of the room, carefully moving its cape from over its body by combination of [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) attaching a femur to her greataxe, and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) more successfully casting Mage Hand. They get a better look at the human-like bones, finding a [Grievous Weapon](../items/magic/enchantments/grievous-weapon.md): Dagger that Noon keeps, and four [Chausain platinum coins](../items/coins/chausain-platinum-coin.md). While the party has no understanding of where the coins are from, Ephaine recognises the [elvish](../languages/elvish.md) written on them. The body is a clear sign that long ago an adventurer from the age of [the Second Coming](../history/events/the-second-coming.md) infiltrated the crypt but was killed by its traps and challenges, laying here ever since. The party lacks the context to figure this out.

Ephaine tries to get the door open again, activating Starry Form: Archer again and shooting the door with a spectral arrow to get it to open, believing that to be the condition required. When the door doesn't open she moves closer to inspect it, causing the door to slide open. She realises that the door has some sort of proximity based trigger to it.

The party proceed inside, traversing the stone corridor as it transitions to ice, following it as it snakes slightly upwards for the next few hours. Eventually it comes to another section of stone corridor at the top of a sudden steep slope. The party find a closed stone door. Exhausted from being awake all night, they choose to sleep here in relative safety.

Ephaine casts Detect Magic and senses a magical presence from the [Quartz Chalice](../items/magic/quartz-chalice.md) beyond the door. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) manages to push the door open, allowing the pair to look inside. Ephaine spots the first of four chalices on a pedestal before them, giving off a magical aura. In this moment the pair are attacked by a chitine lurking in the darkness, beginning combat.

The party defend themselves as they begin to figure out the chalice trial room, watching as seemingly endless chitine descend from magical darkness on the roof above each of the four pedestals bearing identical chalices. While fighting takes place around the first pedestal, Ahsha grabs a chalice and escapes back into the corridor, everyone falling back.

Ephaine puts her Moonbeam to good use, noting that the chitine will blindly run through it and kill themselves, even after observing other chitine do so in front of them. This helps with the party's crowd control strategy. Additionally she fires a Guiding Bolt at the furthest chalice, knocking it from its pedestal, shattering it across the floor. Ahsha similarly smashes hers on the floor when she drops it. The party's suspicion that destroying the chalices will stop the chitine from appearing above each pedestal is proven incorrect.

Ephaine Misty Steps back into the room to try and get her hands on another chalice. Noon casts Summon Shadowspawn to make [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appear and use Dreadful Scream, frightening a lot of chitine. [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) casts Slow to help slow down a few more, the collective effort keeping the worst of the chitine away from Ephaine as she makes a do or die dash through the room, chitine beginning to swarm her as [Nills](../characters/nills.md) stays close.
