## Summary

While visiting [Shrine to the Stars](../places/structures/shrine-to-the-stars.md) near her home village of [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md), [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) discovers the entrance to [Devdaha Crypt](../places/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md). What secrets does this ancient, danger-filled place hide?

## History

### [AA16](../sessions/AA16.md)

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md), encouraged on by her father [Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md), leads [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) up the hills to the east of the [Seren Farmstead](../places/buildings/houses/seren-farmstead.md), arriving at the [Shrine to the Stars](../places/structures/shrine-to-the-stars.md). Knowing this place to be a place with the best views of the stars, she shows [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) how the standing stones align with the stars above. The sky is crystal clear, owing to the presence of a crystal dragon lair nearby.

Ephaine searches the stars, finding herself drawn to the archer constellation which is reaching out to her. As she notices this, [Pajaru](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) sends a pulse of his energy to the shrine, allowing the secret passageway to be accessed. Ephaine, Noon, and Korina all sense this arcane change in the area, as does [Nills](../characters/nills.md) who wonders aloud what it is to Noon, not knowing precisely what this place holds.

Ephaine activates her Starry Form: Archer, allowing her to see and interact with the staircase set into the intact horizontal standing stone. She begins to step into it, everyone else seeing her feet pass through solid stone. She encourages everyone to follow, the party tentatively making their way through what they perceive as stone, though with her Starry Form active, they are able to pass through it. Once inside, they can see clearly through the standing stone's underside, a view of the starry sky beyond it.

They follow the staircase down into the first room, the Archer trial. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) steps into the room, triggering a Guiding Bolt trap that strikes her in the chest. This makes the party wary of where they stand. Ephaine casts Misty Step to teleport to one of the staircases, observing the skeletons of the early [Cepine](../lineages/cepine.md) who settled [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) after [the Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md), buried with short bows which they clutch, even in death.

Ephaine casts Detect Magic, spotting an abjuration aura on the skeleton underneath a decaying cape in the middle of the room, and another magical trap in front of the stone door at the other side. On this door she sees points of light that match the archer constellation. As her Starry Form fades, the points of light vanish. She casts Dispel Magic to disarm the trap before going over to inspect the body. Her, Noon, and Ahsha find it to be human-like, wearing cloth fineries and buckled leather straps, not matching the skeletons set into the crypt's walls.

Ahsha moves to the wall to look for a missing skeleton. As she ascends the stairs on the right hand side of the room she triggers all 12 of the skeletons there to rise, readying their bows for combat.

As the early combat ensues, Ephaine uses her spectral archer to shoot at the door, fulfilling all conditions for the door to open. It begins to slide downwards slowly. The party begin to fight off the skeletons from that side of the room.

When Korina uses Channel Divinity: Turn Undead, many of the skeletons on both sides of the room are destroyed instantly, but this has the effect of waking those that remain on the other side. They begin to drop down into the central area, targeting her specifically as the fight continues.
