## Summary

Every year the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) graduate a cohort of new members in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). In the year 312 PA, the [Astorrel Agents](../campaigns/astorrel-agents/astorrel-agents.md) party graduate as [Astorrel Squad Hands](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md), and are assigned to [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) together.

## History

### travelling to Graduation

The graduates-to-be all made their way from [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md) (where the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) training programme is based) to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) over 8 days. They all traveled separately and arrived at different times.

Prior to graduation day, the graduates were laid up in [The Mission's End](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-missions-end.md), unable to leave. They stayed here socialising, eating and drinking, while waiting for graduation.

### Graduation Ceremony Speech

The graduates assembled with the rest of their graduate cohort of 100 in [Kirrel Hall](../places/buildings/kirrel-hall.md), before a stage set up specifically for graduation.

[Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md), as [Astorrel Captain](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-captain.md) of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), welcomed everyone to the city.

[Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) delivered the graduation ceremony speech in which they waxed lyrical about the ideals of the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

### Graduation Pledge

Next, each graduate needed to prove that they worshipped at least one insider god to prove that they practiced [The Order of the Diamond](../organisations/the-order-of-the-diamond.md), the Astor state religion.

The graduates then made their way out of [Kirrel Hall](../places/buildings/kirrel-hall.md), down the street, out of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), into [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md), and then into [Diamond Prime](../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md). Along the entire route was a parade crowd, there to see who the new graduates were and cheer them on.

Once at the temple, each graduate decided which door to enter, and by extension, which god they would pray in front of.

| Character | God |
| --- | --- |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) |
| [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) |
| [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) |

Following a prayer at the shrine of their chosen god, a caretaker painted the god's symbol on each graduate's forehead, in that god's colour. This acted as proof of the deed.

Once done, the graduates made their way back to [Kirrel Hall](../places/buildings/kirrel-hall.md), the parade crowd still gathered.

### Graduation Presentation

Back in [Kirrel Hall](../places/buildings/kirrel-hall.md), each graduate was presented with their military badge, rank, and graduation purse (70 gp). One by one each graduate was called to the stage, in alphabetical order, and proceeded by their rank, which they did not know before this point.

Once on stage, [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) affixed the military badge to their robes and gave them a handshake. [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) then gave them their graduation purse and bowed to them.

| Named Graduate | Rank |
| --- | --- |
| Aaron Druum | [Astorrel Member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) |
| [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) |
| [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) | [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) |
| [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) | [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) |
| [Redwyn Humpledopper](../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) | [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) |
| [Turnuroth Balasar](../characters/turnuroth-balasar.md) | [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) |
| [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) |

#### Exceptional Trainee Bonus

The top 5 graduates received an extra 10 pp in their graduation purse. They had been identified by the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) training programme (through the [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md) mentors) as having exceptional potential.

This extra coin was added to their purse without fanfare, making it unclear why it was there. The recipients would become aware of this bonus through their superior officer.

### Superior Officer Assignment

Once the graduate presentation ended, the graduates made their way to the opposite end of [Kirrel Hall](../places/buildings/kirrel-hall.md) to read from a board who their new superior officer is.

Graduates were assigned to the three [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) strongholds in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md), and [Dunmore](../places/cities/dunmore.md).

Those assigned to superior officers in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) were expected to meet with them immediately.

This ended the graduation ceremony.
