## Summary

In trying to investigate [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md), [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) had brief correspondence with [Raine Soulier](../characters/raine-soulier.md). A brief mention of Raine in his letter to [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) gives the party a lead for more answers.

## History

### [MC02](../sessions/MC02.md)

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) opens the lead lined box, discovering [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md) left to them by [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md). They open the letter ([L-MC-06](../letters/L-MC-06.md)) and read it. Here they find mention of "Raine in [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md)", but do not recognise the name.

### [MC05](../sessions/MC05.md)

While confiding in [Nacnar Morwesyrr](../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md) in Raine's House, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) asks if she knows a "Raine" who lives in [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md). She doesn't, but suggests trying in [Hochwald](../places/cities/hochwald.md). She gives them the name of one of her friends who lives there, [Disanz Brickbrow](../characters/disanz-brickbrow.md). She points out that Disanz can be found by asking around in inns - her reputation as a heavy drinker will point in her direction.

Vētrall convinces the party to head with them to [Hochwald](../places/cities/hochwald.md) to search for Raine, so the party departs for [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) by hired coach, intending to take [Lilaweg](../places/roads/lilaweg.md) through to the capitals.
