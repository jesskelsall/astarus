## Summary

The [Purple Rain](../purple-rain.md) party members all cross paths in [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), centered around the appearance of the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite.

## History

All four characters are present in [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) at the start of the campaign, for different reasons:

| Character | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) | Came in search of the meteor after hearing about it. |
| [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) | Her deva dream showed a meteor over [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md). |
| [Torbra Tauff](../../../astarus/people/torbra-tauff.md) | Heading to the closest city to seek answers about their unknown race (Genasi). |
| [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) | Searching for her missing father. |

### [PR01](../sessions/PR01.md)

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) shared a cart to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) from the village of Grasthwaite for about 2 days, though they didn't talk during the journey. They both arrive in [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) at the [Goldreach Stables](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/goldreach-stables.md) before heading deeper into town.

[Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) is reflecting on her missing father in [Heather & Horticulture](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/heather-and-horticulture.md)'s secret garden when Heather Pentz finds her. She gives [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) 1 gp and instructs her to buy something from the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Market that might cheer her up. Here she bumps into [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md).

Torbra is entering [The Slippery Weasel](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/the-slippery-weasel.md) ahead of the rest of the party. They all sit at the same table, largely ignoring each other, until [Alistair Hawthorn](../../../astarus/people/alistair-hawthorn.md) paces the room, followed by [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) asking them about the meteor.

### [PR02](../sessions/PR02.md)

Following a night where [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) returns to her home while the rest of the party sleep at [Holyrook Farm](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/holyrook-farm.md) (and fight off wolves in the night), the party meets back up so they may return to [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) to help him search for the meteorite.

From this point on, they are solidified as a party of four.
