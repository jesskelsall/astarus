## Summary

There are other genasi in the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) makes it his business to know as many of them as possible, and research their collective nature.

## History

### [PR37](../sessions/PR37.md)

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) uses her downtime in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) to do research on the word "genasi", given to her by [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md). She once again heads to the [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

Here she has little luck finding the word in use, but catches the attention of [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md), the librarian. She tells him of the word and how she came to know of it, but lies about why she is looking for it, claiming to be interested in learning more about [Simanelli Tyrol](../characters/simanelli-tyrol.md). Flavian doesn't fully believe her, so questions her quietly about what she'd do with the information she seeks. When Torbra says it would depend on what she learns, Flavian is happy enough to tell her more.

She asks Torbra to leave 5 gp on the counter and return first thing in the morning. Torbra thanks him for his help and does as instructed. As she leaves she sees Flavian conceal the coins under a book.

## Planning

Genasi will be heavily employed in efforts to defeat [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md), due to their abilities not being suppressed by anti-magic fields.
