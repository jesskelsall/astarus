## Summary

There are other genasi in the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) makes it his business to know as many of them as possible, and research their collective nature.

## History

### [PR37](../sessions/PR37.md)

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) uses her downtime in [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md) to do research on the word "genasi", given to her by [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md). She once again heads to the [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/government/hawks-perch.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/settlements/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

Here she has little luck finding the word in use, but catches the attention of [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md), the librarian. She tells him of the word and how she came to know of it, but lies about why she is looking for it, claiming to be interested in learning more about [Simanelli Tyrol](../characters/simanelli-tyrol.md). Flavian doesn't fully believe her, so questions her quietly about what she'd do with the information she seeks. When Torbra says it would depend on what she learns, Flavian is happy enough to tell her more.

She asks Torbra to leave 5 gp on the counter and return first thing in the morning. Torbra thanks him for his help and does as instructed. As she leaves she sees Flavian conceal the coins under a book.

### [PR39](../sessions/PR39.md)

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) returns to [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/government/hawks-perch.md) in the early hours of the morning and is let in by [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md). Not long after arriving, [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) arrives to meet her.

Darius notes that he is aware of Torbra due to [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s participation in the [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md) tournament, but wasn't aware of her elemental lineage. The pair introduce themselves formally. Darius explains to Torbra that he has an affinity for fire, providing a brief demonstration where he harnesses fire in the palm of his hand.

Darius asserts that Torbra has an affinity for earth, explaining that he knows because he met another ([Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md)) in [Eskrigg](../places/settlements/cities/eskrigg.md) while there for the tournament, after a period of exchanging letters. He provides Flavian's details so that Torbra may write to him herself.

When Torbra begins to speak of what she learned about genasi from [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md), Darius indicates that they shouldn't speak so openly about the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), so he ushers Torbra upstairs. The pair speak quietly between two bookshelves away from Flavian's ear.

Darius makes it clear that he has conducted his own research on genasi but finds the library lacking, noting a desire by the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) to control information on the subject. He is thankful to learn more from Torbra, particularly the word "genasi" and the positive connotations within the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).

Torbra tells Darius about [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) and her journey to Iredale with her father. Darius expresses a wish to visit her, but regrets that his next [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission only takes him to Eaglesfield, so it will have to wait.

The pair resolve to stay in touch, Darius demonstrating the Sending spell as a method of reaching Torbra while they head in opposite directions of the kingdom.

The following morning, [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) casts Sending on [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md), informing her that he has sent a letter to [Flavian Giltrop](../characters/flavian-giltrop.md) informing him of her earth genasi lineage. Torbra doesn't reply, not knowing how to.

## Planning

When [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) next speaks to [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md), he will ask for her help with the following tasks as and when relevant, cautioning her to be careful how and where she is communicating:
- Write to any genasi she knows, passing along Darius' address.
- Inform Darius of anyone from outside of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) willing to speak about the outside world.

Genasi will be heavily employed in efforts to defeat [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) in [Eskrigg](../places/settlements/cities/eskrigg.md), due to their abilities not being suppressed by anti-magic fields.
