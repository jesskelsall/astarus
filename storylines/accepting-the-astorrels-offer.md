## History

### [PR20](../sessions/PR20.md)

As part of the verdict of the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) trial of [the firbolg controversy](the-firbolg-controversy.md), [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md) declares that the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain.md) party must join a military organisation of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) following the absolution of their crimes.

After the trial, [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) is the first to make an offer to the party. They explain that they could join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) as a squad of four, would be able to work with [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) on issues relating to [the meteoric threat](the-meteoric-threat.md), and that they would be paid for each mission they complete.

The party thanks them for their offer but declines to accept until they'd had time to consider all their options.
