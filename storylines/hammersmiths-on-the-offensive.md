## Summary

The [Hammersmiths](../organisations/criminals/hammersmiths.md) have began openly opposing the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md), challenging their authority over the criminal underworld. Can they be stopped?

## History

### [MC01M](../sessions/MC01M.md)

In [Creek](../characters/creek.md)'s letter to [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) ([MC01M-L-1](../letters/MC01M-L-1.md)), [Creek](../characters/creek.md) added a secret message in invisible ink that warned the pair of [Hammersmiths](../organisations/criminals/hammersmiths.md) closing in on [Murkwallow](../places/cities/murkwallow.md), and to be careful.

After returning to [Tabaxi's Folly](../places/buildings/tabaxis-folly.md), a young female human Hammersmith assassin tried to kill [Wedge](../characters/wedge.md) with a shortsword. Kera and Marik fought her off, knocking her unconscious and tying her up. [Creek](../characters/creek.md) then entered the bar from his back room and executed her by slitting her throat with a butterfly knife.

While transporting [Pouring Grain](../characters/pouring-grain.md) to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md), [Hammersmiths](../organisations/criminals/hammersmiths.md) ambushed the skimmers in [Kulevi](../places/towns/kulevi.md). Upon heading downstairs after staying the night in [the Quail's Nest](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-quails-nest.md), the party found the ground floor of the inn completely deserted. While checking for signs of life, Marik was stabbed by a kenku Hammersmith hiding in a store room.

During the ensuing fight, three Hammersmith bandits entered the inn as part of their ambush plan. All three were killed. The ambushing kenku was knocked unconscious but came to mid-fight, escaping out of the back door through the storage rooms.
