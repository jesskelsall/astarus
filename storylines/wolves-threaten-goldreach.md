## Summary

Wolves roam the plains and forests surrounding [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), attacking livestock and people alike. They are growing increasingly problematic.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) Prelude

6 months prior to the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) campaign, at the beginning of spring, the wolves that live near [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) moved from the north east to north west, making residence in the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md). From here, their numbers swelled.

Their attacks were infrequent and opportunistic, usually happening at night against easy pickings or foolish wanderers. As livestock and person death counts increased, the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) took an interest in culling the wolves, but were never able to find their den.

Cleo Hurley, the wife of Janus Hurley, was one such victim. She died in the night when she went to investigate a commotion in the barn containing their pigs at [Hurley Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hurley-farm.md).

### [PR02](../sessions/PR02.md)

During the night, the wolf pack in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) are attacked from deeper in the cave by the three Meteoric Watchers. They hatched two days ago and have grown big enough to threaten the wolves directly. Many of them are slaughtered, but about half of the pack manage to escape, including the matriarchal dire wolf. They run towards [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) in a panicked frenzy. Occasionally a few wolves split from the pack, most returning shortly after.

While the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party (minus [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)) slept at [Holyrook Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/holyrook-farm.md) during their first night in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), two wolves attacked the cow barn in which they were sleeping. The party killed both wolves.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) wakes up at her home ([Wizira's House](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/wiziras-house.md)) to the sound of disturbances on the edge of the forest. She goes to investigate, finding a large pack of wolves running towards [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) from the forest to the north. They are injured and are keeping an eye on their backs as they run.

### [PR03](../sessions/PR03.md)

The wolf back descends upon the north western edge of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), around the [Four Scythes Inn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/four-scythes-inn.md). They search the streets and begin breaking down doors, attacking those they find inside.

The [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party, arriving from behind, fights and kills the wolves near the inn, while down the street [Alistair Hawthorn](../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md) and his morning patrol of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) engage the dire wolf and her guard, killing them all.

This puts an end to the wolves threatening [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md).

### [PR04](../sessions/PR04.md)

Heading north west out of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) in search of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), the party soon find wolf tracks, with some blood spots amongst the dirt and grass. They track this north towards [Nightcrest Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/nightcrest-farm.md) before choosing to check at the farm for information about the meteorite.

### [PR05](../sessions/PR05.md)

The party fights with several wolves on their way to [Ray Lake](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/ray-lake.md). They emerge from the nearby forest line. These are stragglers that didn't follow the rest of the pack into [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md).

### [PR06](../sessions/PR06.md)

The party finds [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) by following the increasingly prominent tracks that the wolf pack left as it exited the cave and the forest. Copious blood around and inside the cave where the wolves were living suggested that something attacked them viciously, slaughtering many of them where they lived, while the rest fled in terror.

The party correctly deduce that the wolves that fled were the ones that attacked [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md).

### [PR08](../sessions/PR08.md)

The party puts together the final piece of the puzzle: the wolves in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) were killed by the Meteoric Watchers following the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md)'s crash landing, and their subsequent hatching. The attack was brutal and devastating, forcing the rest out of the cave in a panic.
