## Summary

[The Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s sword, [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md), has a storied history that goes beyond [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md), all the way back to Chausain.

## History

### [MC01F](../sessions/completed/MC01F.md)

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) gets a letter ([MC01F-L-1](../letters/MC01F-L-1.md)) from [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) informing them that [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) has passed away, and that they should come back to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) for his funeral. Vētrall does so.

While there, Hanz informs Vētrall that the Vulpes family is starting to bicker about what will happen to Geen's possessions. Vētrall finds the situation sad and not in the spirit of his legacy.

After returning from [Trubska](../places/villages/trubska.md), Vētrall is at [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) while Geen's will is ready by the Vulpes Family, though they are not present for the reading or made aware of its contents. The Vulpes Family learn that [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md) is bequeathed to [Vulpes Soon](../characters/vulpes-soon.md).
