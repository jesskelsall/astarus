## Summary

[The Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s sword, [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md), has a storied history that goes beyond [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md), all the way back to Chausain.

## History

### [MC01F](../sessions/MC01F.md)

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) gets a letter ([MC01F-L-1](../letters/MC01F-L-1.md)) from [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) informing them that [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) has passed away, and that they should come back to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) for his funeral. Vētrall does so.

While there, Hanz informs Vētrall that the Vulpes family is starting to bicker about what will happen to Geen's possessions. Vētrall finds the situation sad and not in the spirit of his legacy.

After returning from [Trubska](../places/villages/trubska.md), Vētrall is at [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) while Geen's will is ready by the Vulpes Family, though they are not present for the reading or made aware of its contents. The Vulpes Family learn that [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md) is bequeathed to [Vulpes Soon](../characters/vulpes-soon.md).

### [MC01M](../sessions/MC01M.md)

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) learn about a [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) in the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) that is due to be opened soon, through a letter [Creek](../characters/creek.md) sends to [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) ([MC01M-L-2](../letters/MC01M-L-2.md)). [Vulpes Geex](../characters/vulpes-geex.md) has provided the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) intel that suggests that following the reading of [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s will, a member of [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) will head to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) to claim the box's contents bequeathed to them. Geex suggests the box may contain [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md).

This potential is of great interest to [Creek](../characters/creek.md), who has sent Kera and Marik to [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) as muscle for an ambush mission. The pair are put to work by [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) who promises them 1,000 gp each if they can return the contents of the box to her intact.

The pair plan their ambush. First they scope the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) using an ornate key ([MC01M-I-1](../cards/MC01M-I-1.md)) given to them by [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md), learning that a sword would most likely be stored on the third floor. They stake out the vaults from [the Round Goose](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-round-goose.md) inn, deciding to act when an armed adventuring type enters the building. From there they will pretend to be a mugger and victim, appealing to their sense of moral duty, before leading them to a back alley and ambushing them.

### [MC03](../sessions/MC03.md)

When [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) orchestrates the party's escape from a [Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) jail in [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) and then meets with them, he gets [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) to reveal what [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) had stored in the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) - the [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md). The revelation that Geen wasn't storing [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md) there is a huge blow to [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md).

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) points out that [Creek](../characters/creek.md) and [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) seek [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md), but didn't know exactly what was in Geen's strongbox, hoping it would be the sword. As a result their mission wasn't specifically to retrieve it, but to retrieve what *was* in the strongbox.
