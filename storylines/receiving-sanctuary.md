## History

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

As the part and [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../../astarus/people/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) reach the gatehouse of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), Sparrow tells [Garrick Rose](../../../astarus/people/garrick-rose.md), the sergeant on duty, that the party is seeking [sanctuary](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

After hearing how they have been running from the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) as suspected [magicborn](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), he offers them [sanctuary](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), stating his rules, which the party accept. They part ways with their clothes and belongings which are secured in chests. They are able to take a few approved items into [sanctuary](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) with them.

The party are placed in [sanctuary](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) quarters on the first floor of [The Sanctum](../../../astarus/places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), where they will be locked inside. However they are able to leave at any time if they wish. Visitors he permits to enter will be able to do so without the party's approval. Meals are brought to them twice per day and Garrick offers to help them with any needs they have while they are in there.

Garrick makes it clear that the offer lasts as long as he is willing to guard them, which he must do from a chair outside their quarters 24/7. His subordinate guards will be running errands and helping him while he does so. Once he tires of this, he will rescind the offer and they'll be forced to leave.

On the first evening the party is visited by [Elysia Vanderboss](../../../astarus/people/elysia-vanderboss.md) who sees the [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) Meteorite and inquires about the circumstances surrounding their acquisition of it. She implores them to keep it a secret and tell no-one.

In the morning after breakfast the party is visited by [Levelle Tristwix](../../../astarus/people/levelle-tristwix.md) who is concerned about the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) the party has killed, and what brings them here. Levelle and [Wizira](../../../astarus/people/wizira.md) talk about [Wizira's Father](../../../astarus/people/wiziras-father.md) and how his plight fits into [the firbolg controversy](the-firbolg-controversy.md) as a whole.
