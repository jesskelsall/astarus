## Summary

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)'s deva [Minsas](../characters/minsas.md) wants her to bring [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) to [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md). Allisa suspects that this will allow the pair to speak directly to their devas, much like she once did.

## History

### [PR37](../sessions/PR37.md)

*See: [Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)*

### [PR45](../sessions/PR45.md)

Following [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) meeting with [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) in combat, the three [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) are able to talk together for the first time.

While recanting her story and experiences of her deva, [Minsas](../characters/minsas.md), Allisa explains that they lead her to [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md) using deva dreams. Once here she was able to speak to them for the first time. Here they implored her to find the other [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) and bring them back to this place. Allisa isn't sure why exactly, but their recent dream together ([Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)) suggests it involves all three of them. Allisa wonders if they'll be able to speak to [Minsas](../characters/minsas.md) themselves once there.

Allisa is under no illusions that getting [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) to the middle of the Kas'ran Desert is a near impossible feat due to them being part of the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Saoirse suggests that [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) could make them spies, but Allisa rubbishes this idea, revealing that the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)'s spies are called the [Astornos](../organisations/astornos.md), and that even knowing about them puts them at great risk.

Thanea expresses a desire to accompany Saoirse there, suggesting they may be able to get a mission that brings them closer to the desert so that they might have a chance. Thanea believes strongly that they will find answers there due to their shared dream.

## Planning

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) will try and get the party to [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md). She could take them directly across the Kas'ran Desert, or teleport them there via a colleague, providing they are able to find or construct a teleportation circle to receive them from.

Once there, both Saoirse and Thanea will see and speak to their devas, asking them whatever they wish. They will both ask the three [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) to restore radiance to Saoirse.
