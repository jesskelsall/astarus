## Summary

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)'s deva [Minsas](../characters/minsas.md) wants her to bring [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) to [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md). Allisa suspects that this will allow the pair to speak directly to their devas, much like she once did.

## History

### [PR37](../sessions/PR37.md)

*See: [Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)*

## Planning

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) will try and get the party to [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md). She could take them directly across the Kas'ran Desert, or teleport them there via a colleague, providing they are able to find or construct a teleportation circle to receive them from.

Once there, both Saoirse and Thanea will see and speak to their devas, asking them whatever they wish. They will both ask the three [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) to restore radiance to Saoirse.
