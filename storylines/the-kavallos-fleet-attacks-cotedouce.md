## Summary

Having captured [The Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) on the Kavallos Sea, [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers attempt to infiltrate the town of [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) in preparation for a larger attack from the sea.

## History

### [MC03](../sessions/MC03.md)

While in a [Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) jail, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) overhear the guards talking in [elvish](../languages/elvish.md) about [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) being late, there being a problem, and the need for a strong guard presence when it arrives. They don't realise that they are talking about a ship.

After escaping the jail and meeting [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md), [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) offers some information that may help the party leave [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) to pursue their own goals. He tells them of [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md), a ship that docked yesterday. It reported a disease onboard, so [Captain Gill](../characters/clef-gill.md) asked the guards to quarantine the ship, which they did. [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md)'s spies learned that there is no disease, it being used as a cover for [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) spies who infiltrated the ship on the Kavallos Sea. They plan to infiltrate the town and destroy its defences before a larger naval attack arrives.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) gives the party a Kavallos longsword as proof, advising them to either defend the town or bring the plot to the attention of its arch-mage [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md). They choose to do the latter, travelling to the [Tour de la Côte](../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md) and meeting with her after convincing a guard outside of the story.

Oriel is troubled by their story, especially as she is close friends with [Captain Gill](../characters/clef-gill.md). She won't reallocate any of the [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) to help, but supports them in their endeavour. She points out the location of the ship and the town's sea wall with cannons on top, advising they either guard the ship or the cannons. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) suggests the spies may already be ashore, so the party agree to head to the cannons.

[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) tells the party that if they're right and they are able to prevent the attack, they will have earned her favour. The party leaves to go and guard the cannons.

### [MC04](../sessions/MC04.md)

The party make their way to the [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) dock, searching for signs of [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers aboard [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md). When [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md), [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) and [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) try to sneak onto the ship using the Dust of Disappearance, their cover is blown when Marik casts Druidcraft and her invisibility ends early.

In the ensuing panic, Valan casts Fog Cloud and the group try to climb aboard, Marik falling into the water. Valan and Vētrall find nobody on deck and are unable to open locked doors to areas below deck before the ship explodes.

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md), now at the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md), watches as [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) explodes in the nearby dock. The [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers that sneaked into the town detonate a cache of gunpowder as a distraction, killing the original crew (including [Captain Gill](../characters/clef-gill.md)) who were tied up below deck.

As guards stationed there run to help, Kera finds himself alone with the cannoneers against advancing [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers who are using the distraction to their real goal. He fights on as [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards arrive to help.

The rest of the party swim ashore, reviving the unconscious Valan before he drowns. They take off running to the coastal artillery, arriving late to the ensuing combat. More soldiers arrive, including a [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) infiltrator that disguises his appearance to get amongst the party, as well as creating an illusion of a catapult that distracts some of the party momentarily.

As the fight progresses, two of the cannons are destroyed by bombs that ignite the powder kegs next to them. The last surviving cannoneer manages to load and fire a cannon twice at soldiers on the structure, killing them instantly.

Vorkazal the Razor, the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) captain in charge of the operation, reveals himself and challenges everyone present to battle. He makes short work of Marik's wolf Wild Shape and two [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guards, but is hit repeatedly by Kera and both [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members with ranged weapons. Both he and the infiltrator are felled, thwarting the fleet's sabotage efforts that night.

On return to [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md), the arch-mage thanks them for their help, regretting not trusting their word and doing more to help in advance.

### Between Sessions

*See: [Raid of Côtedouce](../history/events/raid-of-cotedouce.md)*

With two of the four cannons destroyed on the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md), a battle breaks out the following morning (the [Raid of Côtedouce](../history/events/raid-of-cotedouce.md)). [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) warships destroy the remaining cannons. One ship is destroyed in the process, but the fleet prevails. [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) helps with the town's defence but as it falls and is raided by the fleet, she goes missing.

### [MC06](../sessions/MC06.md)

While walking through [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md), the party hear a town crier delivering the day's news:

> [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) falls to the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md)!  
> After a sabotage plot was thwarted, Kavallos ships broke the sea defences and bombarded the [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md) settlement. Evacuation back to Lorignac is underway. The Alliance Senate will meet to discuss retaliation plans!

The news shocks the party who had assumed that they had saved the town from the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md). [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) remembers that two of the four coastal artillery cannons were destroyed in the attack, so maybe the attack went ahead anyway and they overpowered the remaining two.

Later that day [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md), [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), and [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) ask around the city for more specific news. They collectively learn that the attack occurred the following morning, four [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) ships overpowered the defences and then seized the town. There was loss of life and a hurried evacuation to the north.
