## Summary

[Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) is familiar with divination magic, allowing him to watch people and view future events, all while staring into his bowl of liquid.

## History

### [PR27](../sessions/PR27.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) get their first look at [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md)' divination magic when he uses his scrying pool to check on [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) at the request of [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md).

While looking into his scrying pool, the liquid goes perfectly still. He stares into it while learning over the bowl. As he begins to scry, tears start running down both of his cheeks. He relays details of Wrenn's situation in cryptic prose. When a teardrop drips into the bowl and disturbs the liquid, he snaps out of it.

Once again lucid, Tyburn relays a more cohesive description of Wrenn's situation, noting his apparent surroundings, a person who came to check on him, and the sound of magpies' warning calls.

Following this it takes Tyburn a moment to regain his composure, wiping the tears from his face.

### [PR37](../sessions/PR37.md)

While re-explaining [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s mission brief ([Search for a Meteorite in Tresenda Pass](search-for-a-meteorite-in-tresenda-pass.md)), [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) once again mentions that their information on the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) initially came from [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md)' scrying bowl. She points to it, still out on Tyburn's desk in the far corner of the room.

## Planning

Tyburn's bowl is filled entirely with tears. He cries from both eyes when staring into it, and is only able to do so until a teardrop hits the pool. This suggests he has spent a lot of time staring into it. It is not clear how the pool of tears got started.

Tyburn is secretly a worshipper of [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md). She has provided him with his divination magic and is using him to further her and [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md)'s goals. He is building up trust in his visions so that it can be used against the peoples of [the Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md).
