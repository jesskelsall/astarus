## Summary

Furious with [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md)'s contempt for her efforts as arch-mage, [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) curses him with [Geas](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/geas) to respect authority figures.

## History

### [MC04](../sessions/MC04.md)

Returning to [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md), the party relay their experiences of fending off the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) attack on [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) that night. The arch-mage has been crying at the loss of life and destruction she witnesses in her town, also fearing for [Captain Gill](../characters/clef-gill.md)'s life.

She laments at not trusting the party sooner and regrets only being able to help so much, the projection of her magic from the [Tour de la Côte](../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md) placing a heavy toll on her magical abilities.

Throughout their conversation, [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) is critical of her abilities to aid in stopping the attack, telling her bluntly that she should have done more. She initially agrees, pointing to her magical limitations, but Valan doesn't relent. When Oriel tries to gain Valan's sympathy by impressing upon him the difficulties of leadership, he accepts that he would likely have fared no better, but doesn't see it as an excuse.

By the third time Valan interjects critically, Oriel has had enough. She casts [Geas](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/geas) on him:

*[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md):*
> You will treat authority figures with the respect they deserve, and be courteous while in their presence.

Valan fails his saving throw, cursing him for 30 days.

#### Day 1

Valan immediately curses following the spell's activation, criticising Oriel for casting a spell on him. He immediately succumbs to the spell's effect, falling unconscious in front of Oriel and the party.

Oriel recomposes herself, continuing the conversation while Valan lies unconscious on the floor, stabilised by her magic. After she reaches an agreement with the party to become their patron, she casts healing magic on him to bring him back to consciousness before she teleports the party to [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md).
