## Summary

[Vachel Boucher](../characters/vachel-boucher.md), the finest pianist to have ever lived, died not long after [the Second Coming](../history/events/the-second-coming.md). The remains of his [Naissance](../places/cities/arrepont.md) house are discovered, leading to the discovery of his final piano piece, La Chute de Chausain.

## History

### Pre-session

The remains of [Vachel Boucher](../characters/vachel-boucher.md)'s home is found in [Arrepont](../places/cities/arrepont.md) when digging new foundations for apartments reveals ancient ruins of a building which includes a humble piano. Immediately it is rumoured to be his home. Savnian archaeologists get to work picking through the ruins for clues to the owner and history of the building.

Within two days the Final Piece [Memory Sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) is uncovered in a lead-lined box buried in the corner of the floor. Its discovery is kept secret by the wealthy Savnian overseeing the dig.

### [MC06](../sessions/MC06.md)

While in [Golfmaul](../places/towns/golfmaul.md), the party read that day's news from a poster placed on the notice board:

> Home of [Vachel Boucher](../characters/vachel-boucher.md) discovered!  
> Remains of the pianist's home in [Naissance](../places/cities/arrepont.md) discovered when digging foundations for new apartments. Construction has been halted while archaeologists look for remains.

### Between Sessions

Quickly it is brought to the attention of [Raine Soulier](../characters/raine-soulier.md) who contracts a team to investigate it. Following their discovery of a pianist's performance, the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) was bought by [Lady Crane](../organisations/lady-crane.md) as a gift for Lady Helene. She arranged piano recital to be held, bringing in the most accomplished pianist from the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) to play the piece. Raine arranged for that pianist to spend as much time as needed inside the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) to study the piece.

## Planning

A [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) was found in [Vachel Boucher](../characters/vachel-boucher.md)'s house which contained a recording of him performing his final piece. This was accessed by [Raine Soulier](../characters/raine-soulier.md) who worked to allow the piece to be studied by a [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) pianist who created sheet music for it.

A special recital will be held in [Hochwald](../places/cities/hochwald.md) at the behest of Lady Helene, featuring various musicians playing Boucher's famous pieces, culminating with the first public recital of La Chute de Chausain.

The ball will be attended by Lady Helene, [Lady Crane](../organisations/lady-crane.md) (posing as one of her hands) and [Algar Stormrage](../characters/algar-stormrage.md), as well as dignitaries from the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).

[Raine Soulier](../characters/raine-soulier.md) will be invited but will instead send the party in his stead as a means to liaise with one of his contacts, likely to learn the location of the jail holding someone who can repair [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md).
