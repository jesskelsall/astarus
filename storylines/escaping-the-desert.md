## Summary

The [Memories of Chausain](../campaigns/C3-memories-of-chausain.md) party find themselves suddenly in the Kas'ran Desert under unknown circumstances. A lengthy journey west back to civilisation lies before them.

## History

### [MC02](../sessions/completed/MC02.md)

The [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md) malfunctions, spitting the [Memories of Chausain](../campaigns/C3-memories-of-chausain.md) party out into the middle of the Kas'ran Desert after they are ejected from its pocket dimension due to falling unconscious.

They find themselves waking up face down in the sand in the middle of a sunny day, sweltering in the heat. Looking around they find no signs of anything but dunes as far as the eye can see.

After coming to an uneasy agreement, the [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members and [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) begin marching in a random direction, [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) picking north at random. After a day of walking they sleep in the sand overnight, almost freezing from the plummeting temperature.

The following day they barely make it an hour further before growing too weary to continue, eventually passing out.

Three days later the party wake up in [Dune's House](../places/buildings/dunes-house.md) under the care of [Dune Under Sunset](../characters/dune-under-sunset.md). He informs them that they were found by a trade caravan and are lucky to be alive. When he tells them that they are in [Kuv'narash](../places/villages/kuvnarash.md), it becomes apparent that they aren't even in the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md). Dune providing them with a map of the [Independent States of the Nil'Savnic Alliance](../maps/independent-states-of-the-nilsavnic-alliance.md) only serves to drive this point home.

Dune fetches [Zolné Windclaw](../characters/zolne-windclaw.md) to his house, introducing her to the party. She converses with them behind her cloth covered face, hiding her true identity as a leonin. Finding their situation and disposition curious she agrees to help them west to the next settlement, free of charge. The party don't argue.

Heading west out of [Kuv'narash](../places/villages/kuvnarash.md) the party begin traversing the dunes. Here they encounter three wolves, entering into battle. Zolné proves her worth, revealing her head and leonin lineage in the process. She calls upon the spirits of her ancestors to focus a lion onto herself while [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) helps her with two of the lions, aided by [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and her Thorn Whip cantrip. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) take turns being attacked by the third lion before Vētrall's mind magic shatters its mind, killing it.

The party continue their journey west.
