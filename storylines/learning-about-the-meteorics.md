## Summary

[The Meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) are attacking the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) on behalf of [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) and [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md). There are many properties and secrets to the mysterious [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) and the meteoric creatures created from their dust.

## History

### Pre-campaign

6 months prior to the start of the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) campaign, [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) notices strange meteors crashing to the ground within the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). They find the [Humar Meteorite Crater](../places/rivers-lakes/humar-meteorite-crater.md) and several small shards of the [Humar Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md), made of a material they don't recognise.

With [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) seeing visions of [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) falling on [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) ([Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md)) and [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) ([Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md)), they dedicate their spare time to researching the phenomena, hoping to learn more. Stories of other strange activities in Carnmere and Silethwaite also catch their attention.

Sending [The Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) to Silethwaite, they report back stories of strange creatures ([Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md)) attacking the locals, but return with no evidence of a crater of the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) itself.

[Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) is sent to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) by [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) to search for the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md).

### [PR06](../sessions/PR06.md)

In [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), the party discover that half of the wolf pack had been slaughtered by something deeper within, a foreboding omen.

Delving deeper into the cave, they find the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), emitting bright white light, and a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), searching through the bodies of its victims. When the party is in the line of sight of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), it turns purple, alerting the watcher to their presence.

### [PR07](../sessions/PR07.md)

The party fights two [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) who are seemingly protecting the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), though in reality they are testing the party's combat prowess like those that came before.

Their grey formless face and body, with its weird 6 limb arrangement is foreign to the party. They are a force to be reckoned with, but eventually the party dispatches them, turning them to grey dust with their final blows.

### [PR11](../sessions/PR11.md)

While riding away from [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md), the party ask [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) about the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). Wrenn shows excitement at the specimen, suggesting he knows something about it already.

When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks Wrenn about joining the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) because of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), Wrenn is evasive and refuses to give details of his work, realising he has said too much. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) casts Detect Thoughts, learning of [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) and [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) and how they may negatively react if he shares secrets with those from outside of [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md).

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

While in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), the party is visited by [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md), [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) of [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), which [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) belongs to. She sees [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) holding the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor and is shocked, immediately demanding to know how the party came to possess it.

The party explains that they got it from the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) after fighting 2 [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) which they killed, turning them to dust. [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) put them onto the search for the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), and then fled with him from the town.

Elysia is impressed both by their strength and that they possess a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) in such good condition. She explains that [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) have been searching for other [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), having gathered limited information so far. She is scared shitless by the prospect of the [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) potentially being a concerted effort, and speculates that they may be a form of magic being employed by the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). This would break the [Astor-Syntenne War](../history/events/astor-syntenne-war.md)'s armistice, leading back to open confrontation.

With this in mind, she cautions the party to keep the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) hidden and not speak of this to anyone else, as if word gets out, there may be a mass panic. She wants to gather more evidence before taking the matter higher up the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s chain of command.

The party agrees to do so, finding her trustworthy.

### [PR27](../sessions/PR27.md)

With [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md) over, [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) report to [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) in [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) to receive their first mission. Here they meet [Astral squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), also under Elysia's command, now lead by [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) and including [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md).

Elysia sets the scene by explaining her worry about the meteoric threat - it could be a [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) weapon that precedes open warfare, or something worse. It is imperative that they learn what they can, and fast.

As a group they go through a [timeline](../history/timeline.md) of events, covering what [Astral squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) learned about the [Humar Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md), [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md), [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) [Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), [Carnmere Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/carnmere-meteorite.md), and finally the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md).

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) give detailed accounts of the [meteoric watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), noting their appearance, combat tactics (including teleportation), and resistance to slashing damage. The purple glow of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) is also mentioned, though it is clear that the squad isn't clear how that works.

### [PR28](../sessions/PR28.md)

When [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) meet with [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md), [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) tries to hide the presence of an ill [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) upstairs.

It becomes apparent that not only does he possess the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) that [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) sent them to collect from Silethwaite, but that it has been corrupting him over the last 4-5 months, with him suffering from advanced [Meteoridis](../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md).

Detailing the clearing the [Great Sile Woods](../places/forests/great-sile-woods.md) where the adventurers found the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), Janneke wasn't aware of what the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) was, allowing Slaine to keep it, and not reporting it to Elysia on their return. Janneke assumed Slaine would sell it, but instead he got increasingly obsessed with it.

Both parties decide that if they don't act decisively to separate Slaine from the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) (which he is physically attached to by the hand), he will likely die. [Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) offers to cast Dispel Magic on the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), a plan that everyone agrees to.

When he does so, the magic within the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) transforms [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) into a [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md) before the dispel can take effect, using his body to save itself. The humanoid stands up, reveals its newly formed blade arms, and stabs down toward Kieran.

### [PR29](../sessions/PR29.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) does battle with the [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md). They initially try to subdue and capture it, but it proves tenacious. Its wailing blast inflicts large damage on the party, knocking [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) unconscious early in the fight. Realising how dire the situation is, [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) attempt to move it away from [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and kill it.

The [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) bound to [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md)'s corpse feints its defeat, scattering itself across the floor when Torbra hits with an exceptionally powerful attack. While the party is licking their wounds it attempts to reform into a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md).

Torbra notices the dust coalescing near the corpse. She scoops up what she can into her iron pot, noticing the remaining dust floating through the air and forming a curved vortex into its interior, its speed picking up rapidly.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) blasts the pot with Produce Flame to little effect. Unimpressed she throws the pot across the room, allowing her to witness a pile of the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) slink back into the pot and tip it upright, while the rest of the dust moves across the floor in its direction.

[Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) then rushes over to the pot and casts Dispel Magic, killing the last of the magic in the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) before it can reform into a creature.

### [PR36](../sessions/PR36.md)

When reporting on the failure of their mission ([Investigate the Humar Meteorite Crater](ended/investigate-the-humar-meteorite-crater.md)), [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) inform [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) that before her death, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) was leading the party to the [Humar Meteorite Crater](../places/rivers-lakes/humar-meteorite-crater.md) using Locate Object while focusing on [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). Together they agree that it is likely that the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) is still at the bottom of the lake.

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s account of the giant crocodile raises questions about whether its size is to do with its proximity to the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) suggest that it may have grown attached to or ingested shards of the [Humar Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md). Elysia suggests that it is unlike the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) or the [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md) due to its lack of an exterior [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) appearance.

### [PR44](../sessions/PR44.md)

While camping in the northern end of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) under [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s Tiny Hut, the party wakes when [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) spots a [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) scraping its blade arm against the magical dome. The party observes it for a while, noting its physical differences to the previously encountered [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md), before it teleports away.

As everyone else goes back to bed, the hunter's accompanying [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) opens its eyes, staring at the dome from 60ft away to see what happens. Torbra wakes the party again, pointing out the eyes. The party tries throwing rocks affected by the Light cantrip towards it without leaving the dome, but are unable to throw them far enough to illuminate it. They only see an unmoving set of white eyes, monochrome from their darkvision.

With the party sleeping again, the eyes vanish. The watcher teleports in steps to the other side of the dome, opening its eyes again and startling Torbra a second time, prompting her to wake the party again. After thinking more on what they should do and the persistence of the creature, the party goes back to bed, feeling relatively safe within the Tiny Hut. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) remains awake with Torbra, unable to sleep.

Not long later, the eyes vanish again and return to their original position, the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) joining the Meteoric Mind that has ventured out of [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains/upper-tresenda.md) to join it. It manipulates its [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to create a line of glowing purple eyes, imitating the watcher, giving the appearance of 60 watchers staring at the dome, testing the party's resolve in the dome.

Torbra shouts the party awake, horrified by the number of creatures she perceives. The party panics, expecting combat to be imminent and therefore preparing, but the eyes remain still and unblinking. As [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) return to sleep, the eyes remain in place for another hour before disappearing in an instant, the watcher and mind returning to [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains/upper-tresenda.md) to avoid being seen in broad daylight.

By morning the party discusses the night's events, worried that those creatures are still out there, expecting to have to face them again. The party don't spot three [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) that stayed behind, hiding in the long grass nearby.

As [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s Tiny Hut vanishes, all three hunters teleport into melee range and force blast the party, ambushing them. The party retaliates but encounters the same resistance to slashing damage. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) quickly learns that [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) are immune to psychic damage.

Combat begins to get desperate as the party are unable to land effective hits with conventional weapons, while the hunters slash the party as they please, teleporting around to keep them guessing.

### [PR45](../sessions/PR45.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), having just killed three [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) alongside [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) on the plains of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md), get asked by the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spy what the creatures are, wondering if they are native to these foreign lands. The party explains parts of what they know about them, characterising them as dangerous, originating from [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md).

Throughout their conversation the topic is touched on several times, until Allisa asks what the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad's mission is so far from civilisation. Thanea begins to explain [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md), stating her theory as fact that the creatures are others that have been assimilated by [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), which originates from [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) that corrupt those who interact with them. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) stops her from saying more, wary of the implications of telling a spy such information. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) posits that there is no risk, as either they are created by the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) for war, in which case she already knows, or they are equally in danger, so it would be wise to tell them.

Allisa makes it clear that she isn't aware of [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md), suggesting that if they originate from her government, it's a part that doesn't share information with its spy network.

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) makes the link between [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) and [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md), explaining that her deva [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md) brought her to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to find the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). This gets Allisa invested too, stating her wish to help the party if they'll have her.
