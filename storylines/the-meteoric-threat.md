## Summary

Strange meteors are bringing unknown and dangerous creatures to Astor. Their dangerous nature and consistent arrival is concerning those who are paying close attention.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) Prelude

6 months prior to the start of the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) campaign, [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) notices strange meteors crashing to the ground within the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). They take it upon themselves to investigate them outside of their regular [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission duties.

For the last 6 months, a meteor has fallen roughly once a month.

One member of [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) is a seer who has been able to predict when and where several of the meteors will land. This leads [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) to set off for [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) 5 days before the meteor lands, arriving only 2 days after it does.

Wrenn intends to find the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) and return it to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) so that they may investigate its properties and nature, furthering their independent research.

### [PR01](../sessions/PR01.md)

[Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) meets the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party, offering them up to 50 gp if they are able to bring him evidence of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) - ideally the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) itself.

### [PR06](../sessions/PR06.md)

In [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), the party discover that half of the wolf pack had been slaughtered by something deeper within, a forboding omen.

Delving deeper into the cave, they find the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), emitting bright white light, and a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), searching through the bodies of its victims. When the party is in the line of sight of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), it turns purple, alerting the watcher to their presence.

### [PR07](../sessions/PR07.md)

The party fights two [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) who are seemingly protecting the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), though in reality they are testing the party's combat prowess like those that came before.

Their grey formless face and body, with its weird 6 limb arrangement is foreign to the party. They are a force to be reckoned with, but eventually the party dispatches them, turning them to grey dust with their final blows.

### [PR11](../sessions/PR11.md)

While examining the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor and hearing the party's stories of how they triumphed in the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) uses language such as "I've never seen a specimen like this", alluding to other meteors. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) attempts to question him on this, but Wrenn diverts the conversation, pressing them for further details instead.

When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks Wrenn if it would be possible to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) due to the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) find, Wrenn starts a sentence about his colleagues in the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and the work they are doing to learn about the Meteoric Threat, he stops himself before he can reveal anything, telling the group that he can't say anymore. He falls silent, ending the conversation immediately.

In reaction to this, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts Detect Thoughts to read Wrenn's current thoughts. She learns that he is conflicted - [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) needs help with their work, but he fears how [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) and [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) would react if he involved others without their consent.

This provides [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) with a cryptic window into why Wrenn was interested in the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) in the first place. She chooses not to react and keeps the information to herself.

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

While in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), the party is visited by [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md), [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) of [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), which [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) belongs to. She sees [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) holding the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor and is shocked, immediately demanding to know how the party came to possess it.

The party explains that they got it from the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) after fighting 2 [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) which they killed, turning them to dust. [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) put them onto the search for the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), and then fled with him from the town.

Elysia is impressed both by their strength and that they possess a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) in such good condition. She explains that [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) have been searching for other [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), having gathered limited information so far. She is scared shitless by the prospect of the [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) potentially being a concerted effort, and speculates that they may be a form of magic being employed by the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). This would break the Astor-Syntenne War's armistice, leading back to open confrontation.

With this in mind, she cautions the party to keep the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) hidden and not speak of this to anyone else, as if word gets out, there may be a mass panic. She wants to gather more evidence before taking the matter higher up the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s chain of command.

The party agrees to do so, finding her trustworthy.

### [PR19](../sessions/PR19.md)

When [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) visited the party again in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), she made her intent clear. If the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) win the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) trial over [the firbolg controversy](ended/the-firbolg-controversy.md), she would use her remaining political influence to try and get the party instated as an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad and work alongside her squad on the meteoric threat.

When she asks the party if they would be interested in doing so, they respond in a non-committal manner, not wishing at such an early stage.

### [PR20](../sessions/PR20.md)

Following the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) trial of [the firbolg controversy](ended/the-firbolg-controversy.md), [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) makes the party an offer to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). As part of this they vaguely mention that [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) has informed them of the work her squad has been doing, and that the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party's help in continuing that work would be appreciated.

### [PR21](../sessions/PR21.md)

When [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) is promoted to [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md), the newly formed [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) learn that she will be their superior officer, implying that they will be working with her on the meteoric threat.

### [PR27](../sessions/PR27.md)

With [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md) over, [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) report to [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) in [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) to receive their first mission. Here they meet [Astral squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), also under Elysia's command, now lead by [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) and including [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md).

Elysia sets the scene by explaining her worry about the meteoric threat - it could be a [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) weapon that precedes open warfare, or something worse. It is imperative that they learn what they can, and fast.

As a group they go through a [timeline](../history/timeline.md) of events, covering what [Astral squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) learned about the [Humar Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md), [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md), [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) [Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), [Carnmere Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/carnmere-meteorite.md), and finally the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md).

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) give detailed accounts of the [meteoric watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), noting their appearance, combat tactics (including teleportation), and resistance to slashing damage. The purple glow of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) is also mentioned, though it is clear that the squad isn't clear how that works.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) mis-remembers how many [meteoric watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) they killed, stating that one of the two got away. This causes Elysia to send [Astral squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to investigate further and tidy up loose ends.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is forced to place the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) on the table, and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) gives up her pouch of gravel-filled [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). Both are kept for Elysia so that [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) can study them that same day, and for safe keeping as they are the few pieces of evidence the group possesses. This annoys Saoirse.

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) is sent to [talk to the Morning Chasers](ended/talk-to-the-morning-chasers.md), who investigated Silethwaite on [Astral squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md)'s behalf, with the hope that Starfall's [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) experience will call attention to new clues. They are given a deadline of that same day, so they leave immediately.

### [PR28](../sessions/PR28.md)

When [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) meet with [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md), [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) tries to hide the presence of an ill [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) upstairs.

It becomes apparent that not only does he possess the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) that [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) sent them to collect from Silethwaite, but that it has been corrupting him over the last 4-5 months, with him suffering from advanced [Meteoridis](../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md).

Detailing the clearing the [Great Sile Woods](../places/forests/great-sile-woods.md) where the adventurers found the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), Janneke wasn't aware of what the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) was, allowing Slaine to keep it, and not reporting it to Elysia on their return. Janneke assumed Slaine would sell it, but instead he got increasingly obsessed with it.

Both parties decide that if they don't act decisively to separate Slaine from the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) (which he is physically attached to by the hand), he will likely die. [Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) offers to cast Dispel Magic on the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), a plan that everyone agrees to.

When he does so, the magic within the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) transforms [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) into a [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md) before the dispel can take effect, using his body to save itself. The humanoid stands up, reveals its newly formed blade arms, and stabs down toward Kieran.

### [PR29](../sessions/PR29.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) does battle with the [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md). They initially try to subdue and capture it, but it proves tenacious. Its wailing blast inflicts large damage on the party, knocking [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) unconscious early in the fight. Realising how dire the situation is, [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) attempt to move it away from [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and kill it.

The [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) bound to [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md)'s corpse feints its defeat, scattering itself across the floor when Torbra hits with an exceptionally powerful attack. While the party is licking their wounds it attempts to reform into a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md).

Torbra notices the dust coalescing near the corpse. She scoops up what she can into her iron pot, noticing the remaining dust floating through the air and forming a curved vortex into its interior, its speed picking up rapidly.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) blasts the pot with Produce Flame to little effect. Unimpressed she throws the pot across the room, allowing her to witness a pile of the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) slink back into the pot and tip it upright, while the rest of the dust moves across the floor in its direction.

[Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) then rushes over to the pot and casts Dispel Magic, killing the last of the magic in the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) before it can reform into a creature.

### [PR30](../sessions/PR30.md)

[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) sees the corpse of [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) first hand in [the Dog's Groke](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md), with [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) filling her in on the events leading up to his transformation into a [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md). It is now clear to her that [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) found the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) in Silethwaite.

With their mission complete, [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) embark on their next mission to Humar Estuary to see if they can find any more evidence of the [Humar Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md).

### [PR36](../sessions/PR36.md)

When reporting on the failure of their mission ([Investigate the Humar Meteorite Crater](ended/investigate-the-humar-meteorite-crater.md)), [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) inform [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) that before her death, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) was leading the party to the [Humar Meteorite Crater](../places/rivers-lakes/humar-meteorite-crater.md) using Locate Object while focusing on [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). Together they agree that it is likely that the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) is still at the bottom of the lake.

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s account of the giant crocodile raises questions about whether its size is to do with its proximity to the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) suggest that it may have grown attached to or ingested shards of the [Humar Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md). Elysia suggests that it is unlike the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) or the [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md) due to its lack of an exterior [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) appearance.

### [PR36T](../sessions/PR36T.md)

When [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) meets with [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md) in [Supreme Hall](../places/buildings/supreme-hall.md), Thanea tells Corville of her prophetic dream about the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). Corville responds that he is aware of [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s work on the meteoric threat.

Before she departs, Corville wishes her well on her "meteoric studies".
