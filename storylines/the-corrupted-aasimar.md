## Summary

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is a fallen [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md), corrupted by the power given to her by her hag patron, [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md). As she learns about her powers and those of [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md), she realises that something is wrong with her...

## History

### Pre-campaign

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md)'s father is [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md), a deva. As a result of her mother being human and her father being celestial, she was born an [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md).

At a young age, [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md), a hag, offered her power in exchange for knowledge of the world. She accepted, a deal which would see her become a warlock. In doing so, she also became a fallen [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md).

### [PR10](../sessions/PR10.md)

*See: [Saoirse Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-saoirse-1.md)*

### [PR11](../sessions/PR11.md)

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is distant at various times, contemplating the dream the night before. At one point when they need to keep moving, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) attempts to lift her up so she can be placed back into the cart, but resists, snapping back to her senses. She chastises Torbra for trying something so drastic.

Later, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) reads Saoirse's thoughts using the Detect Thoughts spell. She hears Saoirse lamenting her dream.

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

#### Saoirse Patron Chat 1

While the rest of the party is going to sleep in [sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) goes into the bathroom and closes the door. She drapes a towel over the oil burning light's glass container, darkening the room. She runs a bath and gets into the bathtub before calling out to [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md), telling her that she's lonely, misses her, wishes that they could spend some time together, as well as the adventures & dreams that she's experienced lately.

There is a long period where there is no response before the light in the room goes out completely, and Saoirse hears her patron's voice:

*[Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md):*
> You accepted their help. How could you!?

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*
> Whose help?

Immediately the light comes back on and Saoirse is left wondering what her patron meant. She finishes her bath and goes to bed.

### [PR25](../sessions/PR25.md)

*See: [Saoirse Deva Dream 2](../dreams/deva-saoirse-2.md)*

Both Saoirse and Thanea wake up in the middle of the night.

When Saoirse goes to shower, Thanea confronts her. The pair realise that they woke up at the same time and have been having similar dreams about radiant glowing hooded figures with wings. Saoirse learns that Thanea sprouted these wings in their last tournament match while Saoirse was unconscious. She wishes that she could have wings. The pair bond over their shared experiences and agree to tell each other of any dreams they have going forward.

After Thanea leaves, [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) turns out the lights and talks to Saoirse. The pair bicker over Effie's absence, though Effie is indifferent to Saoirse's needs. She does however act on her expressed wish to have wings, granting her Necrotic Shroud wings. Saoirse is outraged due to their lack of use for flight, though Effie feels these are better. Saoirse reluctantly accepts the gift.

### [PR33](../sessions/PR33.md)

*See: [Saoirse Deva Dream 3](../dreams/deva-saoirse-3.md)*

### [PR34](../sessions/PR34.md)

While travelling across the Humar Estuary, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) speaks privately with [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) about her latest dream. The pair discuss their respective dream experiences to date. Saoirse once again tells Thanea that she wishes to have radiant wings just like her and that she looks up to her.

Saoirse wants to do anything she can to work toward getting her own radiant wings but feels helpless and lost. Thanea agrees to help her. Saoirse is disparaging about her Necrotic Shroud wings, comparing them unfavourably to Thanea's.

During her night watch Saoirse tries her hardest to summon her spectral wings, eventually succeeding after much effort and self doubt. She experiences a radiant warmth in her chest that travels through her shoulder blades and into her back skin, turning a necrotic cold as it goes. She is once again disappointed by her wings, a shiver sent down her spine as she touches their tacky surface.

She wakes up Thanea to show her them. Thanea doesn't recognise her and her white hair at first. The pair talk about Saoirse's experience with activating her wings. Thanea tells her that she feels the same radiant warmth when she activates her own, making the pair feel comfortingly similar. Saoirse gets excited at the prospect that perhaps she will be able to summon wings radiant wings at some point in her future.

Thanea talks of her first time activating Radiant Soul in the [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md) tournament and how she felt desperate and needed to protect her friends. She suggests that Saoirse might need a similar moment.

### [PR37](../sessions/PR37.md)

*See: [Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)*

### [PR38](../sessions/PR38.md)

Immediately following their shared dream, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) discuss its contents.

Saoirse is worried about the darkness that overtakes her in the dream, declaring that she fucked up what was happening in the dream, and apologises profusely. Thanea tries several times to reassure her that her own deva dreams aren't literal and don't necessarily reflect future events to come.

The pair wonder on the nature of Saoirse's darkness. Thanea asks about [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md), Saoirse suggesting that her patron's influence may be having an adverse effect on her somehow. Thanea suggests that Saoirse has two powerful entities vying for her attention, so she should pick whatever feels most right.

### [PR45](../sessions/PR45.md)

Meeting with [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) for the first time, [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) discuss with her devas, [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md), and what that means for both [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md).

Saoirse tells Allisa about how terrifying their dream ([Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)) was from her perspective, her negatively impacting the ending of the dream making her feel awful about herself. She is negative about herself when trying to describe the way her [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) abilities manifest and the bad things happening in all of her dreams.

Allisa tells Saoirse that she believes her patron ([Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md)) has done more damage to her than she realises, and offers to help guide her to things that she suspects her deva ([Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md)) is trying to show her.

## Planning

Saoirse will continue having deva dreams depicting altered past events that she has already experienced, with [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) present. He will test her devotion and resolve. If she pleases him, he will continue to help her.

In the long term, Saoirse will get the opportunity to kill [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md). Doing so will be the final piece of the puzzle that converts her from a fallen [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) to a "zealous" [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md). This will see her adopt a radiant form that summons two giant radiant daggers that she can use to enhance her attacks.

Prior to that, with [Robin](../players/robin.md)'s blessing, Saoirse will trade in warlock levels at key points and replace them with multi-classed levels in cleric or paladin (her choice). The less warlock she is, the closer to being saved she is.
