## Summary

While the Purple Rain party are on the run from the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) with [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md), [The Crimson Blades](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/the-crimson-blades.md) catch up with Wrenn, capturing him so that he can pay his debt to them, one way or another.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../purple-rain.md) Prelude

Prior to [PR12](../sessions/PR12.md), [Stalker](../../../astarus/people/stalker.md) sends [Morog Whiteknuckle](../../../astarus/people/morog-whiteknuckle.md) to capture [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md). They trailed him to [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md), where they lay in wait, knowing that he'd be protected by the [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md) while staying at [Alistair Hawthorn's House](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/places/alistair-hawthorns-house.md).

When the party fled [Goldreach](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/settlements/goldreach/README.md) to seek [sanctuary](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) at the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../astarus/places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), Morog sensed an opportunity and went in pursuit of Wrenn.

### [PR12](../sessions/PR12.md)

[Morog Whiteknuckle](../../../astarus/people/morog-whiteknuckle.md) and his entourage caught up to the party and Wrenn not far from [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md). Using their faster horses, they were able to close the gap to the group quickly, who sensed an impending battle.

Despite seeing the attack coming, the party were quickly overwhelmed despite trying to hide behind their overturned cart. Initially evading capture, Wrenn was put to sleep by [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) who was trying to prevent bandits from tying him up.

As the party sustained heavy injuries and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) fell unconscious from her injuries, the party realised it would be prudent to surrender.

Morog, only here for Wrenn specifically, allowed the party to live, making it clear that his mercy saved their lives.

Revealing himself to be part of [The Crimson Blades](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/the-crimson-blades.md), [Morog Whiteknuckle](../../../astarus/people/morog-whiteknuckle.md) explained to the party that Wrenn owed them money, and their intention was to take him back to their boss.

Morog and his entourage then took the 2 still alive horses and left to the south with Wrenn slumped over the back of a horse, still asleep.

### Between Sessions

Not long after being captured, Wrenn is woken up by the movement of the horse he is draped over. Keeping his composure, he manages to cast Sending with the copper wire coiled around his wrist, contacting [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../../astarus/people/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) ([Goshawk squad](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk.md) lead) to explain his capture and the danger the party is in:

> Help! Captured by bandits. Please help my friends! Hunted by [Astornox](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astornox/astornox.md). They know information that will save Astor. Get them to Elysia!

> Captured near [Frizthwaite](../../../astarus/places/villages/frizthwaite.md). Heading to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) by boat or road. Blue firbolg, grey human--

Shortly thereafter Morog notices that Wrenn is muttering to himself and confiscates his copper wire before restraining him more thoroughly.

### [PR13](../sessions/PR13.md)

Without Wrenn, the party reflects on what to do next. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) points out that she read his mind and knows the names of the people he wanted to take them too, suggesting that they don't need him any more.

The group decides to press on to [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) without him.

### [PR14](../sessions/PR14.md)

[Sarleen Truestriker](../../../astarus/people/sarleen-truestriker.md) reveals to the party that [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) contacted [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../../astarus/people/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) after he was captured by [The Crimson Blades](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/the-crimson-blades.md), imploring him to help the party reach [Northhaven](../../../astarus/places/cities/northhaven.md) without him.

### [PR15](../sessions/PR15.md)

[Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../../astarus/people/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) informs the party of the full details of the message they received from [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md), including the part about the information they know saving Astor. The party has no idea what Wrenn is referring to.

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

While in [sanctuary](../../../astarus/civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), the party briefly mentions to both [Elysia Vanderboss](../../../astarus/people/elysia-vanderboss.md) and [Levelle Tristwix](../../../astarus/people/levelle-tristwix.md) that [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) was captured by bandits.

## Planning

[Morog Whiteknuckle](../../../astarus/people/morog-whiteknuckle.md) and his entourage take [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../astarus/people/wrenn-piznarck.md) back to Carnmere as instructed by [Stalker](../../../astarus/people/stalker.md), their leader.

They intend to get him to pay his debt to them, either directly, or by extorting him.
