## Summary

[Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) wanted [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) to have a strange metal ball. Why, and what is it?

## History

### [MC01F](../sessions/completed/MC01F.md)

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) gets a letter ([MC01F-L-1](../letters/MC01F-L-1.md)) from [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) informing them that [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) has passed away, and that they should come back to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) for his funeral. Vētrall does so.

While there, Hanz informs Vētrall that the Vulpes family is starting to bicker about what will happen to Geen's possessions. Vētrall finds the situation sad and not in the spirit of his legacy.

After returning from [Trubska](../places/villages/trubska.md), Vētrall is at [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) while Geen's will is ready by the Vulpes Family, though they are not present for the reading or made aware of its contents.

Immediately following this, Hanz gives a letter from Geen to Vētrall. It also contains an ornate key that opens a lockbox in the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md). Geen writes to Vētrall that one of his prized possessions is in it, and they should not speak of this to the family.

Vētrall makes their way to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) with their student [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md).

### [MC02](../sessions/completed/MC02.md)

Once in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md), [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) goes alone to the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) to unlock [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s lockbox. They enter and proceed to the locker, opening it to find a lead lined box ([MC02-I-1](../cards/MC02-I-1.md)) containing the [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md) and a letter from Geen ([MC02-L-1](../letters/MC02-L-1.md)). They add the box to their backpack before leaving.

When [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) cause a scene to try and steal what they think is [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md) from Vētrall, the sphere malfunctions, causing Chausain Guards to appear in the street, surrounding the group including [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) who came across the commotion at the perfect time.

As the fight progresses the sphere finishes creating a pocket dimension, transitioning everyone into it seamlessly. They find themselves on the second wall of Chausain as the Battle of Chausain begins below. More guards pour onto the wall and quickly surround the party.

The battle progresses until the outer wall is breached through the main gate, pouring enemy soldiers into the lower ring. More guards arrive on the walls, dispatching everyone in turn, causing them to be ejected from the pocket dimension, vanishing from the wall in an instant.

Eventually only [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) remains. As he is surrounded and skewered by guards he observes a potent spell being cast from the Tower of Chausain, projecting magical symbols in a steadily growing horizontal plane focused on the top level of the tower, which begins emanating purple light from within. Valan falls unconscious and is ejected.

The party are teleported to the middle of the Kas'ran Desert by the [memory sphere](../items/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md), now mechanically broken and inert ([MC02-I-3](../cards/MC02-I-3.md)). At this point Vētrall hasn't opened the chest at all.

When the party wake up in [Dune's House](../places/buildings/dunes-house.md) in [Kuv'narash](../places/villages/kuvnarash.md), Vētrall excuses themself to open the box in the privacy of a nearby outhouse. They find the [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md) and a letter from [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) ([MC02-L-1](../letters/MC02-L-1.md)) explaining his storied relationship with the sphere.
