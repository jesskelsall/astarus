## Summary

[Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) wanted [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) to have a strange metal ball. Why, and what is it?

## History

### [MC01F](../sessions/completed/MC01F.md)

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) gets a letter ([MC01F-L-1](../letters/MC01F-L-1.md)) from [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) informing them that [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) has passed away, and that they should come back to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) for his funeral. Vētrall does so.

While there, Hanz informs Vētrall that the Vulpes family is starting to bicker about what will happen to Geen's possessions. Vētrall finds the situation sad and not in the spirit of his legacy.

After returning from [Trubska](../places/villages/trubska.md), Vētrall is at [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) while Geen's will is ready by the Vulpes Family, though they are not present for the reading or made aware of its contents.

Immediately following this, Hanz gives a letter from Geen to Vētrall. It also contains an ornate key that opens a lockbox in the Nilus Vaults in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md). Geen writes to Vētrall that one of his prized possessions is in it, and they should not speak of this to the family.

Vētrall makes their way to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) with their student [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md).
