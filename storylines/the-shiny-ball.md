## Summary

[Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) wanted [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) to have a strange metal ball. Why, and what is it?

## History

### [MC01F](../sessions/MC01F.md)

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) gets a letter ([L-MC-01](../letters/L-MC-01.md)) from [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) informing them that [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) has passed away, and that they should come back to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) for his funeral. Vētrall does so.

While there, Hanz informs Vētrall that the Vulpes family is starting to bicker about what will happen to Geen's possessions. Vētrall finds the situation sad and not in the spirit of his legacy.

After returning from [Trubska](../places/settlements/villages/trubska.md), Vētrall is at [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) while Geen's will is ready by the Vulpes Family, though they are not present for the reading or made aware of its contents.

Immediately following this, Hanz gives a letter from Geen to Vētrall. It also contains an ornate key that opens a lockbox in the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) in [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md). Geen writes to Vētrall that one of his prized possessions is in it, and they should not speak of this to the family.

Vētrall makes their way to [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md) with their student [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md).

### [MC02](../sessions/MC02.md)

Once in [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md), [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) goes alone to the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md) to unlock [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s lockbox. They enter and proceed to the locker, opening it to find a lead lined box ([MC02-I-1](../cards/MC02-I-1.md)) containing [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md) and a letter from Geen ([L-MC-06](../letters/L-MC-06.md)). They add the box to their backpack before leaving.

When [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) cause a scene to try and steal what they think is [Mémoire de Unevaire](../items/echneshment/weapons/memoire-de-unevaire.md) from Vētrall, the sphere malfunctions, causing Chausain Guards to appear in the street, surrounding the group including [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) who came across the commotion at the perfect time.

As the fight progresses the sphere finishes creating a pocket dimension, transitioning everyone into it seamlessly. They find themselves on the second wall of Chausain as the Battle of Chausain begins below. More guards pour onto the wall and quickly surround the party.

The battle progresses until the outer wall is breached through the main gate, pouring enemy soldiers into the lower ring. More guards arrive on the walls, dispatching everyone in turn, causing them to be ejected from the pocket dimension, vanishing from the wall in an instant.

Eventually only [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) remains. As he is surrounded and skewered by guards he observes a potent spell being cast from the Tower of Chausain, projecting magical symbols in a steadily growing horizontal plane focused on the top level of the tower, which begins emanating purple light from within. Valan falls unconscious and is ejected.

The party are teleported to the middle of the [Kas'ran Desert](../places/topography/valleys-plains-deserts/kasran-desert.md) by the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md), now mechanically broken and inert ([MC02-I-3](../cards/MC02-I-3.md)). At this point Vētrall hasn't opened the chest at all.

When the party wake up in [Dune's House](../places/buildings/houses/dunes-house.md) in [Kuv'narash](../places/settlements/villages/kuvnarash.md), Vētrall excuses themself to open the box in the privacy of a nearby outhouse. They find [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md) and a letter from [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) ([L-MC-06](../letters/L-MC-06.md)) explaining his storied relationship with the sphere.

### [MC03](../sessions/MC03.md)

On arrival in [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md), a [Republic guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) checkpoint searches the party's belongings, looking for contraband entering their territory. A guard finds [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md) on [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md), causing the lead guard to arrest the party for smuggling and possessing an ancient artifact. Some of the party resist arrest, but ultimately everyone is captured and thrown in a [Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) jail.

Here [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) are called hypocrites by [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) for being thieves themselves despite Kera and Marik having been ordered to steal from Vētrall. Vētrall tells the truth, that the sphere was a gift from [the Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md), but they don't know what it is or its significance.

When the party make an attempt to escape the jail, Vētrall finds the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) in their lead lined chest in their bag. [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) later reveals that the empty jail and the sphere in their possessions was something he orchestrated.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) suggests that the sphere is the most valuable artifact he has ever came across, with an astronomical potential value to the right buyer. He tells the party some of what he knows - it is from [Oonar](../celestial-objects/oonar.md), likely from Chausain, making it over 3,000 years old. This is why the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) want it, because they see it as part of their cultural heritage.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) conveys a feeling that the party should be left to proceed on their journey unhindered, a feeling given to him by [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md). He tells the party that [Creek](../characters/creek.md) and [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) shouldn't get their hands on the sphere, nor should the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). He has no love for any of them.

Vētrall keeps the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) as the party look for a way to leave [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) and head back to somewhere closer to home.

### [MC04](../sessions/MC04.md)

After the party defeats the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) soldiers that have infiltrated [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) and tried to sabotage the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md), they return to [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) who grants them her arch-mage's favour, offering to do something for them. After a brief debate they all agree that they'd like to learn about [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md) that [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) possesses.

After examining the orb closely, Oriel tells them that it is a [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md), a type of artifact from the Elves of Chausain, originating on [Oonar](../celestial-objects/oonar.md). It is a form of lost magic, used to record and relive memories, only able to be created and accessed by exceptional arch-mages. Due to the nature of [the Second Coming](../history/events/the-second-coming.md), elves were brought to [Astarus](../celestial-objects/astarus.md) with only their clothes and possessions on their persons, so there are few surviving examples of [memory spheres](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) in existence.

She also points out that this one seems particularly well constructed, not vocalising her observation that her Detect Magic spell doesn't find anything magical within, not the typical experience with [memory spheres](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md). She tells the party that she believes it may be broken due to a rattling sound from the mechanism within.

As she explains what little she knows of how [memory spheres](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) work, [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) muse on their experiences in [Starnov](../places/settlements/cities/starnov.md), asking about a city that was attacked by an army at night. Oriel chuckles, telling them that they are describing the Fall of Chausain. Oriel connects the dots, astounded at the suggestion that this [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) may be of that event. If that is the case, she impresses its importance upon the party.

Oriel reveals that she knows the party was jailed by the [Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md), now knowing why - they believe that artifacts from the Elves of Chausain civilisation are part of their heritage, the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) styling themselves as the direct successors of Chausain. As a result they try to acquire and retain such artifacts.

She warns the party against discussing this meeting as it would create a diplomatic incident if it came out that she let them go without seizing the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md). Oriel explains that [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md) and the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) don't see eye to eye, so she is happy for them to continue their search for information on the sphere, not able to help them any further.

She strikes a deal with the party, exchanging their discretion and any information they gain on the sphere for her patronage, giving them 20 pp to get started with their search.

[Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) are keen to learn more about the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md), wanting to know if it is valuable so they can use it for leverage against the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) or simply for outright profit.
