## Summary

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is a fallen [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md), corrupted by the power given to her by her hag patron, [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md). Her father and deva [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) aims to bring her back to the path of light with his guidance.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) Prelude

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md)'s father is [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md), a deva. As a result of her mother being human and her father being celestial, she was born an [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md).

At a young age, [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md), a hag, offered her power in exchange for knowledge of the world. She accepted, a deal which would see her become a warlock. In doing so, she also became a fallen [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md).

### [PR10](../sessions/PR10.md)

#### Saoirse Deva Dream 1

While escape in the cart escaping [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) has a deva dream. She is back in the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), paralysed on the floor, only able to look on as 3 [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) attack and exhaust the rest of the party, who are looking close to death.

[Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) appears to her, kneeling down and offering her his hand. She tries to reach to him, overpowering her paralysis just enough to touch his hand. As she does, she regains the ability to move, and feels a warmth overtake her.

Looking around the meteor crater, she feels disconnected from the events around her, focusing instead on [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md).

On the edge of the cave she sees Effie who looks at her disapprovingly. Looking back at [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md), he shakes his head slowly at Saoirse.

After falling to the ground and standing again, Saoirse finds herself in the middle of the meteor crater, standing between the last remaining [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) and the party. The watcher looks through her, seemingly uninterested in her presence.

Saoirse is given agency to choose what to do. Her chosen action will have ramifications for her future:

| Action | Meaning | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attack the watcher with conventional means. | Deva positive. | [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) sees a willingness to be saved, an easier task. |
| Attack the watcher with warlock magic. | Warlock patron positive. | [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) sees an unwillingness to be saved, an uphill struggle. |
| Leave or protect the watcher. | Meteoric positive. | [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) sees a corruption by [the Meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md), a different struggle altogether. |

Saoirse chooses to draw her daggers (conventional means) and attack the [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md).

As she draws her blades, she notices protector [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) wings on her back, resembling those of [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md). Her daggers glow golden-white, illuminating the nearby space.

The watcher recoils at the sight of them before lunging at her. Saoirse plunges the blades into it, causing it to crack with white light before exploding into [Meteoric Dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) that scatters across the crater.

The dream ends. Saoirse rests peacefully and feels a positive energy upon waking.

### [PR11](../sessions/PR11.md)

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is distant at various times, contemplating the dream the night before. At one point when they need to keep moving, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) attempts to lift her up so she can be placed back into the cart, but resists, snapping back to her senses. She chastises Torbra for trying something so drastic.

Later, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) reads Saoirse's thoughts using the Detect Thoughts spell. She hears Saoirse lamenting her dream.

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

#### Saoirse Patron Chat 1

While the rest of the party is going to sleep in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) goes into the bathroom and closes the door. She drapes a towel over the oil burning light's glass container, darkening the room. She runs a bath and gets into the bathtub before calling out to [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md), telling her that she's lonely, misses her, wishes that they could spend some time together, as well as the adventures & dreams that she's experienced lately.

There is a long period where there is no response before the light in the room goes out completely, and Saoirse hears her patron's voice:

*[Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md):*

> You accepted their help. How could you!?

*[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md):*

> Whose help?

Immediately the light comes back on and Saoirse is left wondering what her patron meant. She finishes her bath and goes to bed.

### [PR25](../sessions/PR25.md)

#### Saoirse Deva Dream 2

While asleep the night after [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s [Nature's Battle 27](ended/natures-battle-27.md) match against [Gloom squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md), [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) has another dream about being awake but unable to move in past events where she was unconscious.

She dreamed of watching her squad battling [Mortar squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md) while she lay paralysed, burning from her wounds. [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) offered a hand to her to help her up. She asks who he is, but the moment she touches his hand, her vision goes white.

Once again she is lying on the arena floor of [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), this time during the match with [Gloom squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md). For a brief moment her view of the arena and [Gloom squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md) is swapped out for [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) bathed in purple light and [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md). The battle continues as it was despite these visual changes. Suddenly the view reverts back.

She looks up, seeing [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) with her Radiant Soul wings stretched wide gliding down to meet her. With her glowing eyes and a kind smile on her face, she surrounds Saoirse with her yellow-gold wings, offering her a hand. As soon as their hands meet, both Saoirse and Thanea wake up in the middle of the night.

#### During the Night

When Saoirse goes to shower in the night, Thanea confronts her. The pair realise that they woke up at the same time and have been having similar dreams about radiant glowing hooded figures with wings. Saoirse learns that Thanea sprouted these wings in their last tournament match while Saoirse was unconscious. She wishes that she could have wings. The pair bond over their shared experiences and agree to tell each other of any dreams they have going forward.

After Thanea leaves, [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) turns out the lights and talks to Saoirse. The pair bicker over Effie's absence, though Effie is indifferent to Saoirse's needs. She does however act on her expressed wish to have wings, granting her Necrotic Shroud wings. Saoirse is outraged due to their lack of use for flight, though Effie feels these are better. Saoirse reluctantly accepts the gift.

*[[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) unlocks her Fallen [Aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) abilities]*

## Planning

Saoirse will continue having deva dreams depicting altered past events that she has already experienced, with [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) present. He will test her devotion and resolve. If she pleases him, he will continue to help her.

In the long term, Saoirse will get the opportunity to kill [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md). Doing so will be the final piece of the puzzle that converts her from a fallen [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) to a protector [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md).

Prior to that, with [Robin](../players/robin.md)'s blessing, Saoirse will trade in warlock levels at key points and replace them with multi-classed levels in cleric or paladin (her choice). The less warlock she is, the closer to being saved she is.
