## Summary

After [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) accidentally tells [Alistair Hawthorn](../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md) that he knows [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), Wrenn and the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party flee [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) as fugitives, hoping for [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) at the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

## History

### Between Sessions

[Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md), fearing that [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) may have been captured by the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), goes to the [Goldreach Astornox Stronghold](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/goldreach-astornox-stronghold.md) to search for evidence to support his theory.

While he is snooping around, he is caught by one of the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), who fetches [Alistair Hawthorn](../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md). The two friends talk about what he is doing, but in doing so, Wrenn accidentally reveals that he's had contact with [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and did not turn her in as a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), enraging Alistair.

Alistair offers Wrenn an ultimatum: wait for the party's return and turn them in when they arrive back at [Alistair Hawthorn's House](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/alistair-hawthorns-house.md), or face punishment as a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harborer. Knowing that the penalty for an [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) is likely death, Wrenn feels he has no choice but to accept.

Thinking about his next move, Wrenn decides to hire some meteor adventurers to find the party north west of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), and sends his crow familiar with them. Wrenn leaves Alistair's house and goes into hiding, feeling certain that staying would not save him from his fate, certain that the party is his last hope of survival.

This sends [Alistair Hawthorn](../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md) into a rage. He sends guards north west after the party, apprehending Arneg Tanagark as a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harborer along the way. When he is returned to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), Alistair sends his [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) through [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) in the night to search for Wrenn.

### [PR08](../sessions/PR08.md)

On the way back to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) with the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party attempts to stop in at [Nightcrest Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/nightcrest-farm.md), seeking the hospitality of Arneg Tanagark for an overnight stay. They find his door open, a disturbance inside, and a small blood splatter in the courtyard.

The party is approached by an [Astornox Guard Corporal](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-corporal.md) and an [Astornox Guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) who inform them that the farm is off limits after Arneg was taken into custody as a suspected [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harbourer.

The corporal, unfazed by [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s firbolg form, offer to escort the party back to [Holyrook Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/holyrook-farm.md) so that they can sleep for the night. While doing this, the guard heads off for [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), intending to tell the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) that they have found [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md).

While crossing the bridge south of [Nightcrest Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/nightcrest-farm.md), two meteor adventurers hired by [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) ask the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) corporal where [Hurley Farm](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hurley-farm.md) is. The guard is courteous and points them up the road. While this happens, Wrenn's crow familiar swoops down and begins pecking and scratching his face.

The adventurers circle back, one drop-kicking the corporal while the other warns the party that Wrenn is in danger, they must get back to him, and not to get caught.

### [PR09](../sessions/PR09.md)

As the party make their way through the streets of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) continues to summon and dismiss Dancing Lights to distract the guards while he moves.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), disguised as an [Astornox Guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md), comes across other [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) who are searching for him, heading towards the [Goldreach Marketplace](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/goldreach-marketplace.md). It is clear that lots of guards are searching for him in a coordinated way.

Wrenn talks to [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) using Message, explaining that things are not going to plan, and asking the party to meet him in the [Heather & Horticulture](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/heather-and-horticulture.md) secret garden, which they do.

Here, Wrenn and Heather explain that Wrenn managed to find out about [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) being captured by the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), but in doing so was caught. Now they need to leave town, or as Wrenn alludes to, he will likely end up dead.

With a need to flee, Wrenn suggests that they can find [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) at either the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) (having revealed he is [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), not [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md)), or at the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Temple. Either would be temporary fixes. The party chooses the former.

While leaving the shop, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), still disguised, gets roped into the search effort by another group of guards and their [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md), while the rest of the party prepares to skip town.

### [PR10](../sessions/PR10.md)

The party begins to leave [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md).

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) follows the [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) to the [Goldreach Marketplace](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/goldreach-marketplace.md). Here she sees [Alistair Hawthorn](../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md) chastising the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) under his command for not having found [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) yet. He insists that they double down on their search efforts within [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), checking each house before returning to him.

One of his officers suggests that he raise the alarm to the neighbouring towns. Alistair dismisses the idea, knowing that it must be done, but insisting they search more before he informs other towns that he's failed to capture a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) harbouring [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) participates in the door-to-door searching briefly, going as far as to search inside of one house before slipping away to the edge of town.

The rest of the party makes their way to the edge of town, linking back up with [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) outside of the [Four Scythes Inn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/four-scythes-inn.md). From here they make their way towards the [Goldreach Stables](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/goldreach-stables.md). Along the way they are spotted by 3 [Astornox Guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) who give pursuit.

Desperate for a way to escape town, the party commandeers a horse and cart from the stables, riding it out entryway right as the guards enter. They attempt to give chase but quickly realise that they're not going to be able to catch them on foot.

Now clear of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) shows the party his [Meteoric Map of Astor](../papers/maps/meteoric-map-of-astor.md). He explains that the large garrison of [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) at Eaglesfield will pose a problem, and that the longer they take to reach [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), the more [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) will be looking for them.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) suggests that the party makes their way to [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) before either travelling down the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), or along the [Humar Cut](../places/roads/humar-cut.md), keeping off the [Northern Road](../places/roads/northern-road.md).

Near the beginning of Grasthwaite Cut, the party sees 2 [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) on horseback riding towards them.

### [PR11](../sessions/PR11.md)

The party pass 2 [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) on horseback without any incident. The guards had no idea of their notoriety and passed by completely unaware.

Torbra took the horse and cart off road in the direction of [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) to the south west. Stopping for a food break and to discuss their plan of action, the whole party agreed that they should take a less traveled route, first heading to [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) and then either down the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) or along the [Humar Cut](../places/roads/humar-cut.md).

Torbra finally got a chance to sleep while [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) rode the horse and cart. This meant that everyone has had a long rest since leaving [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md).

With [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) in view on the horizon, 3 horses each with 2 riders approached from behind. Neither [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) who spotted them or [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) who used his crow familiar to observe them could tell if they are [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) or not.

### [PR12](../sessions/PR12.md)

The bandits tailing the party as they ride towards [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) begin their attack after seeing the cart take a sharp right turn, forcing their hand. Before long they are on top of the fleeing party. They are led by [Morog Whiteknuckle](../characters/morog-whiteknuckle.md).

Sensing an imminent battle, the party stops the carts, unhitches the draft horse for Torbra to ride into battle, and turns the cart on its side to act as cover for the rest of the group.

A mounted battle breaks out, with several of the bandits trying to capture [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) while others take shots with crossbows from horseback.

Eventually the battle culminates with:

- [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) getting knocked unconscious, barely clinging onto life, having been clubbed by two thugs.
- [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) overwhelmed by a battle on two fronts, attempting to save Wrenn from the bandits.
- [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) fleeing from [Morog Whiteknuckle](../characters/morog-whiteknuckle.md) who has been slashing at her repeatedly, heavily injuring her.
- [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) falling off her horse, unable to respond to the threats around her before surrender is the party's only option.

Morog orders the party to surrender, which they reluctantly do. He reveals himself to be part of [The Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md), and that Wrenn owes them money. He makes the point that they're here for him only, which is why they're lucky to be alive.

With no response to the bandits, Morog leaves with the unconscious [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) successfully captured - the party's best chance of seeking [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) taken from them.

### Between Sessions

Not long after being captured, Wrenn is woken up by the movement of the horse he is draped over. Keeping his composure, he manages to cast Sending with the copper wire coiled around his wrist, contacting [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) ([Goshawk squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) lead) to explain his capture and the danger the party is in:

> Help! Captured by bandits. Please help my friends! Hunted by [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). They know information that will save Astor. Get them to Elysia!

> Captured near [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md). Heading to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) by boat or road. Blue firbolg, grey human--

Shortly thereafter Morog notices that Wrenn is muttering to himself and confiscates his copper wire before restraining him more thoroughly.

### [PR13](../sessions/PR13.md)

The party enters the village of [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) to try and get a boat so they can proceed downstream to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), avoiding the roads. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) does not disguise herself while in the village.

Inquiring at the docks, they find they can either buy a boat for 50 gp or rent one for no more than a week.

When the party enters [The Greedy Trout](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-greedy-trout.md) for a drink before deciding what to do, they come across 2 [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) who are at the bar conversing with the innkeeper. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) heads down the street, leaving the village outskirts as a means of putting distance between herself and the guards. As she goes she attracts the attention of people on the street who have already seen the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) who are looking for her.

At the bar [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) learns from the innkeeper that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are looking for someone "tall and blue" ([Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)), and someone with "grey skin" (Torbra). She joins [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and Torbra at their table where she tells them of the former. The group agrees that they'd best leave [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md) quickly.

A villager who saw [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) bursts into the inn, shouting that she's seen her. The [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) rush downstairs to meet her, insisting she shows them where she saw her. They leave in a hurry.

A race to find [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) before the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) do develops. The party fans out before [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) finds [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) making a flower crown. She disguises herself as an old man and the party reconvenes.

The party convinces Torbra to head downstream now, so as to avoid being seen. The rest of the party head back to the docks where [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) buys the boat. Picking Torbra up on the way, they make their way down the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) towards [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), successfully dodging the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md).

### [PR14](../sessions/PR14.md)

Continuing downstream, the party comes across the town of [Beckermet](../places/towns/beckermet.md), seeing where the edge of the town meets the river's edge. With guard towers along the edge of town, they seek to hide themselves as they row past. They are able to hide themselves under their hooded robes enough that they aren't spotted.

Arriving next at [Humouth](../places/villages/humouth.md), the party decides to camp under the giant wooden bridge just outside of the village. When [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) and [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) decide to check in town, they find a heavy [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) presence. While [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) returns to warn [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) stays, learning from the inn that they are hunting [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md). With that the party endeavours to continue 15 minutes downstream before setting up camp for the night.

In the morning, [Sarleen Truestriker](../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md) finds the party along the bank of the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md). Seeing a blue firbolg and grey human, she recognises that she has found the party that she is looking for. Explaining that she is an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) from [Goshawk Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) with orders to find them and bring them back to her [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md), [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md), she is met with distrust.

Revealing that Hidaar was contacted by [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) after he was captured by [The Crimson Blades](../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md), the party begins to trust Sarleen. They agree to be escorted by her to [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md) where they can meet Hidaar, who Sarleen informs them will help them seek [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md).

Travelling along the east bank of the river for the entire day, the party makes camp for the night between the river and some cliffs. In the night they are attacked by gnolls, but they dispatch them without issue.

### [PR15](../sessions/PR15.md)

The following day [Sarleen Truestriker](../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md) continues to lead the party towards [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md). Several hours from [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md) the party, having walked for 8 hours, decides to camp for the night along the riverside rather than push on and risk exhaustion.

First thing in the morning they set off again. Sarleen escorts the party into [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md), leading them through a side street to avoid [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) outside of Humar's Knee on the main street. They emerge further down the street on the other side of the [Ulburn Astorrel House](../places/buildings/ulburn-astorrel-house.md) and make their way inside.

Here Sarleen introduces them to [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md), the [Goshawk Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) lead. Sarleen helps to cut through some of the party's attempted lies about who they are or what they've been through.

Hidaar attempts to understand why [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) felt the party was so important, particularly why he thought the party was important to the fate of Astor. They aren't sure themselves, but they allude to the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), which [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) chooses to keep to herself.

When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) drops her disguise and reveals herself to be the blue firbolg that Wrenn mentioned, Hidaar suspects the story of what happened to [Wizira's father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) has important implications for [the firbolg controversy](the-firbolg-controversy.md), and offers to help them in any way that they can. When another member of [Goshawk Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) returns, they'll order them to escort the party to the relative safety of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

Hidaar orders Sarleen to go on ahead to inform [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) in the [Zenith Spire](../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md) of what's going on, handing her his [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) badge.

When [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) returns from searching for the party, Hidaar introduces them. They order Sparrow to escort them into [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), suggesting they plan their approach after eating. Sparrow reveals their wasps, asks the party about their stealth capabilities, and implores Torbra to leave their armour behind to help their chances at remaining unnoticed.

### [PR16](../sessions/PR16.md)

[Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) discusses with the party how they should go about reaching the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), noting that getting past the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) will be their biggest challenge. With options to go through the gatehouse, over the wall, or under via the sewers, the party choose the sewers.

Departing that night after dark, they make their way carefully out of [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md), over the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md), and into the city's [Sunrise District](../places/districts/sunrise-district.md). After carefully making their way over to the closest building to the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md), Sparrow heads over to the sewer grate and picks the lock open while under cover of their Fog Cloud.

As he runs back, a guard on the wall above stops, hearing the sound of the lock being broken. Unable to see anything, they resume their patrol. The whole party makes their way over to the grate. Still under the cloud's effects, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Torbra jump into the sewer below, Torbra landing with a loud enough splash that the guards on the wall above hear it. The rest descend by rope.

Exploring the sewer below, the party hears guards investigating their entrance. As they begin escalating the search, the party goes down a sewer branch to their left in an attempt to give the guards the slip. When the guards enter the sewer and one spots the party, running towards them, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) casts Eldritch Blast to knock them backwards, accidentally killing them in the process. The party isn't aware of their fate as their torch plunges into the sewage and goes out.

Now in a hurry to leave, the party hurriedly tries to get the next sewer grate along on the inside of the wall open. With the help of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Torbra, Sparrow gets on a rope and files the padlock holding it shut, breaking the lock. Unable to push the grate open with his wasps (Mage Hand), Torbra holds up [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) to push it open. They eventually succeed.

The next guard catches up with the group but is caught in Sparrow's Snare, flipping them over and levitating them in the air helplessly while Sparrow uses Mage Hand to attach a grappling hook and rope to the now open grate. The party climbs out into the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md).

40ft to their left, the party witnesses 6 [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md), including an [Astornox Guard](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) Captain, emerge from the nearby gatehouse and begin pursuit.

### [PR17](../sessions/PR17.md)

As the 6 [Astornox guards](../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) began chasing after the party, everyone but [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) took off down the street in the opposite direction before turning onto a street bound for [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md). [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) used Disguise Self to transform into a 1ft taller intimidating orc, growling bestially with Druidcraft. This halted the guards for a moment and convinced one to flee in terror, but the chase resumed.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) managed to give 2 guards who tried to grab her the slip by casting Hidden Step right before they grab her. She tries to hide after becoming visible again but fails, opting to run and hide a second time in an alley. She gives them the slip before turning into a cat with Wild Shape, running along the rooftops, and reconvening with the party.

On the edge of [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md), Sparrow suggests they don't cross the square itself as there may be guards present. Instead they proceed through a series of alleys that cross other streets. While doing this 2 guards notice them, giving chase. One peels off to get backup. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) casts Eldritch Blast at the remaining guard, knocking him backwards to the floor, ending his pursuit.

On the other edge of [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md), the party emerges into the street proceeding [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street. 4 guards in [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md) notice them and give pursuit. The party runs towards a crossroad, Sparrow indicating that the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) is down the street to the left.

As they round the corner, the street is a dead end, with a building blocking the street. Sparrow, familiar with [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street, knows it to be a trick and informs the party. [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) and [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) step out of the side of the building's brickwork, springing their ambush on the party. Sparrow urges the party to run ahead while he draws their attention.

Fighting erupts. Sparrow hits Vilnia with an arrow, enraging Kur who casts Lightning Bolt at Sparrow from a rooftop, knocking him unconscious. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) climb onto a building on the opposite side of the street while [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) and Torbra wrestle with the guards catching up from behind.

Vilnia attempts to compel [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) to surrender by casting Suggestion on her, but she manages to resist.

Torbra attacks the guards surrounding her, cutting one down and wounding several others. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) follows Sparrow's lead and casts Magic Missile multiple times at Vilnia, knocking her unconscious. After Kur attacks multiple times with Scorching Ray, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) knocks him unconscious with a particularly potent Ice Knife.

As more guards spill into the street, Torbra is surrounded and has no choice but to disengage and flee down the street. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts Sleep on the crowd, sending 3 of them to sleep, while [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) casts Entangle to restrain them and make the street harder to move through.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) takes out her frustration on Kur, firstly by kicking him while he is unconscious, and then when he is brought to consciousness by another guard, by casting Eldritch Blast to knock him unconscious again.

The party make their way along the street, Torbra trying her best to dodge incoming attacks from her pursuers. Eventually they all make their way to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) gatehouse, at which point the 2 guards still pursuing them give up their chase, knowing they can't intervene inside the stronghold's walls.

At this point the party seeks [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) within the stronghold, preventing the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) from pursuing them any further.

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

Upon reaching the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) offers the party [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), permitting them to enter the stronghold and stay out of the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md)'s jurisdiction.

It is made clear to the party that if the offer is rescinded or they choose to leave of their own volition, they will be returned to the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md) where the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) will once again be able to capture them. [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) suggests that due to the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) the party has killed in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), this may now result in their deaths rather than capture.

[Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) explains that if the party doesn't find a way to resolve their situation while they are in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), it is only a matter of time until he grows tired and rescinds his offer of [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

## Final Report

This is a summary of all the run-ins the party had with the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) during this storyline.
