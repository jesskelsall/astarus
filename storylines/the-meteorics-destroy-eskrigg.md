## Summary

[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) and [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) plan their boldest attack on the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) yet - using [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) to wipe out the city of [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md).

## History

### [PR14](../sessions/PR14.md)

*See: [Thanea Deva Dream 3](../dreams/deva-thanea-3.md)*  
*[Thanea Morlay unlocks her Protector [Aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) abilities]*

### [AA08](../sessions/AA08.md)

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) feels a sense of déjà vu while walking the streets of [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) while waiting for the first round of [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md) to commence. She isn't able to figure out why, not yet realising that her previous deva dream took place on these streets.

### [PR23](../sessions/PR23.md)

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) returns to the street in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) that she commuted to [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) along. She recognises it as the starting point of her third deva dream, triggering a strong sense of déjà vu.

Realising the implication of another prophetic dream coming to fruition and her own feelings that they never end well, she takes off down a back alley, losing [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) who was with her. [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) eventually finds her slumped against a statue, sobbing to herself. Finding a crying Thanea, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks what is wrong. Thanea mumbles a non-answer before the pair return to the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md) for the night.

## Planning

[Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) will be destroyed by a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) bombardment that destroys buildings and deploys an unprecedented number of [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md). Most of the population will be wiped out entirely.

[Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md), conspiring with [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md), will fail to see this coming, preventing the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) from preventing the attack.

Potentially a section or building in the city will survive. Why it survived will be crucial to countering the meteoric threat.
