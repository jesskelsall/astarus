## History

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md)

[Starfall squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) will find [Carnmere](../../places/settlements/towns/carnmere.md) is home to [the Crimson Blades](../../organisations/criminals/the-crimson-blades.md), the criminal organisation that captured [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md). [Morog Whiteknuckle](../../characters/morog-whiteknuckle.md) will confront the party if they are conspicuous in [Carnmere](../../places/settlements/towns/carnmere.md).

The disappearances can be chalked up to [the Crimson Blades](../../organisations/criminals/the-crimson-blades.md) killing people as punishment for crossing their organisation and illegal practices.

[Stalker](../../characters/stalker.md), their leader, found the [Carnmere Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/carnmere-meteorite.md) at the behest of [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md). Now infected with [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md), he grows increasingly paranoid and erratic, blaming Wrenn for what has happened to him. Now that he has Wrenn in his custody, he is torturing Wrenn until he reverses the effect on him, which he does not know how to do.

The [Carnmere Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/carnmere-meteorite.md) crash landed west of [Carnmere](../../places/settlements/towns/carnmere.md) near the [Hawkswood](../../places/topography/forests/hawkswood.md), in the hills south of the [Foss Peaks](../../places/topography/mountains/foss-peaks.md). Five [Meteoric Watchers](../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) were killed in the crater by [the Crimson Blades](../../organisations/criminals/the-crimson-blades.md).
