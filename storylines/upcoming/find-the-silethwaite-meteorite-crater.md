## History

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain.md)

[Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) will find a clearing in the [Great Sile Woods](../../places/forests/great-sile-woods.md) that was home to a group of [Meteoric Watchers](../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md). They either cleared the trees or it was logged beforehand and they adopted the space.

Deeper into the forest is the Great Sile firbolgs, who have been fighting off the watchers for some time, though they have not told the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) about this to date. The watchers' numbers have steadily been growing. 

The firbolgs can point the party towards the crater itself, where the watchers have been coming from. Here the party can witness [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) spread across a section of forest in a blanket, breaking down the organic material to create new dust, allowing new creatures to be formed.

The firbolgs thank the party for their help by rewarding [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) with a druidic magical item.
