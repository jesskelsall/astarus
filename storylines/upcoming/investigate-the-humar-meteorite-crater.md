## History

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md)

In order to get onto Humar Estuary by land, [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) will need to pass through Fort Eldrick. The [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) stationed there do not like the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and their incessant coming and going. It will be a challenge to even get onto the estuary.

[Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) will be able to find the [Humar Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md) crater on Humar Estuary. It is much larger than the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) crater, suggesting a larger [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). The crater is waterlogged and very deep.

A larger [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) can be found at the bottom of the crater, showing the same cracks as the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). There is no sign of any creatures.
