## Summary

While fighting the [Meteoric Watchers](../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) touches the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), infecting her mind and body with [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md). Compulsions and changes begin to stir within her.

## History

### [PR07](../../sessions/PR07.md)

During the fight with the [Meteoric Watchers](../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) throws her entire body on top of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) in an attempt to hide the purple glow which she believed may have been benefitting the watchers in the cave.

She immediately passed out on top of the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). While unconscious, she dreamed of a evening's sky filled with stars, all beginning to move in tandem, shifting from white to purple as they accelerated. It felt good, and she wished to be back in the cave, close to the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) and the watchers. Here [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md) compulsions began.

*[[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) becomes cursed with [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md)]*

When [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) wild shaped into a horse kicked the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) immediately woke up. She was able to rejoin the fight, but was compelled to grab the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) as she went.

### [PR08](../../sessions/PR08.md)

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) allows [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) to look at the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) briefly. She keeps hold of it for the party, wrapping it in a cloth and attaching it to the side of her belt.

### [PR11](../../sessions/PR11.md)

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) gives [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) the pouch of [Meteoric Dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) that she collected. When [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) points out that [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) also has the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) in her possession, he insists on seeing it. She holds it out in the palm of her hand, but is reluctant to hand it over to Wrenn.

She insists that Wrenn gives her the pouch of dust back in exchange for the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), which he agrees to, but still she won't let it go easily. She demands a pinkie promise from Wrenn in order to part with it, and only if he will return it to her once he's done looking.

He complies. After looking at the [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor, he hands it back to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) for safe keeping.

This is a clear manifestation of her compulsion to stay near to [Meteoric Dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md).

### [PR19](../../sessions/PR19.md)

While in [sanctuary](../../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), Torbra questions Saoirse directly about why she carries the [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor around everywhere she goes. She explains that she wants to protect it and probably likes it more than the rest of the party. Thanea defends her, noting that [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) considers the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) and pouch of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to be important.

When [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) visits a second time she sees Saoirse in the bathroom clutching the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), refusing to leave. When Elysia leaves she gives Saoirse a perplexed look.

### [PR20](../../sessions/PR20.md)

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) learns that there is something magical about the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), but the anti-magic field present inside [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) makes it impossible for her to learn any more than that.

### [PR22](../../sessions/PR22.md)

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), now out of the anti-magic field of [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), decides to experiment with the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) and the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) she has collected. She finds that ingesting some of the dust will enhance her magical abilities, but it also has psychedelic effects.

*[[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) learns how to ingest [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to induce the [meteoric dust effect](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust-effect.md)]*

### [PR25](../../sessions/PR25.md)

Hours before the [Nature's Battle 28](natures-battle-28.md) final, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) ingests a portion of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). She does so because she feels useless in the arena, so she may as well fight while high.

*[[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is now under the effect of the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md)]*

### [PR26](../../sessions/PR26.md)

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) fights in the [Nature's Battle 28](natures-battle-28.md) final while under the effect of the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) she ingested. She casts Meteoric Blast for the first time. Following [Starfall squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s defeat, during which she was knocked unconscious, she is revived by an [Astorrel member](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md). Startled and still freaking out due to the dust's effects, she runs out of the arena.

### [PR27](../../sessions/PR27.md)

Having ran from the arena, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) looks for a quiet spot on the streets of [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md). She slumps against a wall half way along a quiet street, closing her eyes to put her warped vision at rest. She is startled by passers by and eventually disturbed by [Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) and [Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md), who she struggles to see properly.

Allisa recognises that Saoirse is in a bad way before trying to help her by placing her hand on her cheek. Saoirse grabs Allisa's wrist, causing her to relent before moving on.

When the rest of the party catch up to Saoirse, she instinctively casts Meteoric Blast at [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) but misses. Afterwards she has a private conversation with [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) in which she admits to having taken the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). When Saoirse expresses a desire to experiment further in hopes of finding a way to harness the dust's power without the hallucinations, Thanea is supportive, but advises that she doesn't ingest any more in the same way, fearing her doing herself permanent damage.

After a good night's sleep, the effects of the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) wear off.

*[[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is no longer under the effect of the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md)]*

### [PR28](../../sessions/PR28.md)

When the party meet [the Morning Chasers](../../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) in [the Dog's Groke](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md), [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) meets [Slaine Alabaster](../../characters/slaine-alabaster.md). Slaine contracted [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md) 4 to 5 months ago. He shows advanced symptoms including extreme protectiveness of the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) that he possesses, and appears almost feral.

Saoirse gets the sinking feeling that the only difference between her and him is the passage of time - this is her in several months time.

When not completely zoned out, Slaine talks about not letting anyone have his [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). In particular when he sees Saoirse there is sense that he recognises her situation, perceiving her as a big threat to his [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), even after Saoirse charms him.

Ultimately Slaine turns into a [Meteoric Humanoid](../../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md), the final stage of [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md).

### [PR29](../../sessions/PR29.md)

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) witnesses [Slaine Alabaster](../../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) turn into a [Meteoric Humanoid](../../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md), terrifying her to the point of fleeing the first floor of [the Dog's Groke](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md). Only when she hears her party suffering greatly at its hands does she return to intervene.

When the creature is defeated, she looks upon the fleshy remains of Slaine, unrecognisable due to the amount of damage the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) did to it. After bringing [Kieran Bennington](../../characters/kieran-bennington.md) back to consciousness she vomits from shock, before running to fetch [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md).

### [PR30](../../sessions/PR30.md)

In [the Dog's Groke](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md) after she brings [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) to survey the remains of [Slaine Alabaster](../../characters/slaine-alabaster.md), [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) tells Elysia that she is drawn to the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) in the same way that Slaine was the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md), and that she worries that in several weeks she will transform into a [Meteoric Humanoid](../../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md) much like he did.

This troubles Elysia who keeps an eye on Saoirse, particularly after she retrieves Torbra's iron pot of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md).

While heading back to [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md), Elysia tells Saoirse to stay with her as she wants her to meet someone that may be able to help her.

Back at [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) Saoirse once again speaks with Elysia, asking directly for her help in combating the compulsions she feels. Elysia tells her that [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) owes her a favour, so she leaves immediately to retrieve him.

On their return Mergin speaks to Saoirse about how she feels, finding it unlikely to be a simple matter of weakness. When Saoirse off-handedly uses the word "curse" to describe how she feels, Mergin has an idea. He casts Remove Curse on her rather suddenly, causing her to fall unconscious.

When she wakes up 5 minutes later all of her compulsions are gone and she feels refreshed and energised. She and Elysia thank Mergin for his help, the favour cashed in.

*[[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is no longer cursed with [Meteoridis](../../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md)]*
