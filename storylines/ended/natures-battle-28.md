## History

### [AA06](../../sessions/AA06.md)

Returning to [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md) to begin their next mission, [Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) is given their invite to Nature's Battle 28 ([AA06-L-1](../../letters/AA06-L-1.md)).

After discussing how competing will affect their next mission, Bryce reassures them that the tournament is their priority if they choose to compete - the mission can wait. After a discussion they choose to compete, responding to [Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md) by letter sent from [Astpost Northhaven](../../places/buildings/shops/astpost-northhaven.md).

### [PR21](../../sessions/PR21.md)

Immediately following the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party's [Astorrel graduation](astorrel-graduation.md) as [Starfall Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) hands them their invite to Nature's Battle 28 ([PR21-L-1](../../letters/PR21-L-1.md)).

The party is excited at the prospect of competing.

### [PR22](../../sessions/PR22.md)

The [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party accepts [Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md)'s offer to compete in Nature's Battle 28, replying to her letter.

### [AA07](../../sessions/AA07.md)

[Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) learn that [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) has been swapped with [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) from [Dolphin squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/dolphin-squad.md). They will still compete in the tournament, now with Noon. The remaining few days of their downtime is used to prepare.

When [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) bumps into her mentor [Ludolf Hornwallis](../../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md), he offers them a placed to spar as combat practice - the [Northhaven Astorrel Arena](../../places/buildings/northhaven-astorrel-arena.md), taking them to it via the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md). Here they briefly consider fighting each other but Ephaine in particular is uncomfortable with the idea.

Ludolf fetches four [Astorrel Lieutenants](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-lieutenant.md) that know the True Polymorph spell. They transform four boulders in the gated back room into two tigers, a giant spider, and a giant scorpion, pitting the squad against them without them knowing exactly what is going on.

[Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) excel at the fight, dispatching their opponents, each transforming back into a boulder as they are defeated. This gives the squad a chance to practice their techniques and learn about how each other fight (Noon in particular) before the tournament proper. Ludolf is impressed by what he sees.

On the day of the tournament [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) meet [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md), [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md), and [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md) in the square outside of the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/zenith-spire.md), greeted by many [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) who have came to see the party off. [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) arrives too, teleported to [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md) by [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) before [Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) are teleported too. Ephaine glimpses [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) as they make their own way to the square, right as the teleport occurs.

### [AA08](../../sessions/AA08.md)

[Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md), [Starfall Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), and [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) arrive at the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md), teleported there by [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md). They are present for the beginning of the tournament as [Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md) and [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) welcome all of the competing squads to the tournament. The rules are explained and the tournament brackets are drawn randomly.

There is time for the squads to socialise among themselves and with higher up military members present in the room. Both [Starfall Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) use the opportunity to talk to [Mortar Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/mortar-squad.md), [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) sizing them up ahead of their match against them. They find the squad to be full of fighting talk and quite standoffish.

[Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) meet for the first time, the latter knowing much more about the former. As they are on opposite sides of the tournament bracket they don't talk much about their combat prowess.

After several hours the first round of the tournament begins.

The match between [Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) takes place. [Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) wins.

### [PR23](../../sessions/PR23.md)

During the fight [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) downs [Yoroe Briskboots](../../characters/yoroe-briskboots.md) with Ice Knife. The subsequent explosion of ice damages her while she is unconscious, drawing cries from the crowd who are aware of the tournament's rules. Fortunately an [Astorrel member](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) is able to get to Yoroe quickly. They cast Spare the Dying, giving the thumbs up to [Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md) that she is okay. The fight continues uninterrupted.

[Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) comes very close to decapitating [Diarmuid Kavanagh](../../characters/diarmuid-kavanagh.md) which her final halberd strike against him. Instead she opens up a gash on the back of his neck, the shock from which knocks him unconscious.

### [PR24](../../sessions/PR24.md)

The match between [Starfall Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Gloom Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md) takes place. [Starfall Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) wins.

[Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) sprouts wings thanks to her [aasimar](../../lineages/aasimar.md) Radiant Soul, dazzling the audience as she flies around the arena, dishing out ranged magical damage as she goes. She is eventually knocked unconscious and falls from the sky when [Norma Collarbone](../../characters/norma-collarbone.md) summons a bestial spirit above her which hits her in mid-air.

### [AA09](../../sessions/AA09.md)

The match between [Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Komodo Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) takes place. [Komodo Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) wins.

A dejected [Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) are knocked out of the tournament.

### [PR26](../../sessions/PR26.md)

The match between [Komodo Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) and [Starfall Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) takes place. [Komodo Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) wins.

Following the match [Komodo squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/komodo-squad.md) are awarded with tournament winner medals and receive their prize of 100 pp to split between them. [Faelon Fireburner](../../characters/faelon-fireburner.md) charitably gives his 25 pp share away to members of the audience.

After the awards ceremony both squads are invited to a formal after party hosted by the tournament officials. Both squads except [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) attend.
