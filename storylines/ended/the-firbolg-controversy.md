## Summary

For some time the classification of firbolgs as people of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), rather than as part of the forest, has been a topic of controversy. The [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have been indecisive in addressing this issue.

The conscription of [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md) based on their race alone brings this issue to the attention of the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) who must pass judgement.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) Prelude

Firbolgs have existed in [South East Kardan](../../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md) for at least as long as the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) has. They keep to themselves in their tribal settlements, deep in the woods of Astor.

More recently, the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) have taken an active interest in firbolgs, classifying them as inherently [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) and conscripting them into military service on sight. So far this has only applied to firbolgs they have found in Astor settlements, or those who wander too far from the depths of the forests.

So far the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have been indifferent to this behaviour, though as the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) become more blatant about capturing firbolgs and educating people on their apparent danger, some within the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have started to feel particularly uncomfortable about the practice, feeling that firbolgs are part of nature rather than civilisation, and as such should be protected by the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

While there are outspoken [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) who wish to oppose the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md)'s actions, [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md), [Astorrel Commandant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md), and those directly beneath them, have so far not declared a formal stance.

### [PR15](../../sessions/completed/PR15.md)

When [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) meets [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md), the party become aware of the firbolg controversy and the two opposing views present within the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). They explain that what has happened to [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md) may be the catalyst that brings the issue to a head, with a trial conducted by the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) being a likely outcome.

As a fervent supporter of protecting firbolg as part of nature, Hidaar offers to help the party in any way they can, ordering [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) to escort them to [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) so they can seek [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) there.

### [PR18](../../sessions/completed/PR18.md)

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) mentions [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md)'s capture to [Garrick Rose](../../characters/garrick-rose.md) while they are preparing to go into [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). He assures the party that if the [Astorrel Commandant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md) can't help them, he will ensure that someone looks into the matter for them.

[Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) visits the party in [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) on the morning of their first full day in [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). They speak with [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) about her father, talking about how his capture fits into the firbolg controversy as a whole. Levelle finds [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) well informed and explains that there are conflicts in other places such as the [Mocker Swamp](../../places/forests/mocker-swamp.md).

Levelle asks what the rest of the party's involvement is in this matter, but they met [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) after her father disappeared.

### [PR19](../../sessions/completed/PR19.md)

While in [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) the party is visited by [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) who gives them the day's town crier script ([PR19-L-1](../../papers/letters/PR19-L-1.md)). This shows that there are troubles in [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md) regarding firbolgs in the [Mocker Swamp](../../places/forests/mocker-swamp.md) which the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) suppressed.

[Rowan Great Sile](../../characters/rowan-great-sile.md)'s visit to see [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) showed that there are other known firbolg clans throughout [South East Kardan](../../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md), including in the [Great Sile Woods](../../places/forests/great-sile-woods.md) and [Tulligwood](../../places/forests/tulligwood.md).

[Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) hinted that an [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) trial between the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) over the firbolg controversy may be imminent. This was then confirmed when [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) and [Carras Southroot](../../characters/carras-southroot.md) came to visit. They explained what was at stake as part of the trial and encouraged the party to share any information they could to help the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) win.

### [PR20](../../sessions/completed/PR20.md)

The [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) trial for the firbolg controversy takes place.

Prior to the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party's arrival for the witness phase, the debate phase takes place. The [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s argument is lead by [Rowan Great Sile](../../characters/rowan-great-sile.md).

During the witness phase, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) is called as the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s primary witness of what happened to [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md), with the aim of painting their plight as sympathetic and indicative of the hardships faced by many firbolgs. [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) gives an accurate testimony on the circumstances of her father's disappearance as well as the lengths the party and her have gone to while trying to get him back.

[Alistair Hawthorn](../../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md)'s testimony reveals that [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md) was apprehended for casting magic that was witnessed by the [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), resulting in his capture for being [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md).

The trial's verdict, delivered by [Corville Thornox](../../characters/corville-thornox.md), ruled that firbolgs are people of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) like any other, meaning they are held accountable to its laws and customs. However firbolgs that remained in their clans away from civilisation would be under the protection of the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), with interference by the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) forbidden. This verdict was a compromise of sorts.

With that, the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) had made their call, ending the controversy in its current form and making the rights of firbolgs explicit to both the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).
