## Summary

The [Memories of Chausain](../../campaigns/C3-memories-of-chausain.md) party find themselves suddenly in the Kas'ran Desert under unknown circumstances. A lengthy journey west back to civilisation lies before them.

## History

### [MC02](../../sessions/MC02.md)

The [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../../items/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md) malfunctions, spitting the [Memories of Chausain](../../campaigns/C3-memories-of-chausain.md) party out into the middle of the Kas'ran Desert after they are ejected from its pocket dimension due to falling unconscious.

They find themselves waking up face down in the sand in the middle of a sunny day, sweltering in the heat. Looking around they find no signs of anything but dunes as far as the eye can see.

After coming to an uneasy agreement, the [Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members and [Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) begin marching in a random direction, [Keranios](../../characters/keranios.md) picking north at random. After a day of walking they sleep in the sand overnight, almost freezing from the plummeting temperature.

The following day they barely make it an hour further before growing too weary to continue, eventually passing out.

Three days later the party wake up in [Dune's House](../../places/buildings/dunes-house.md) under the care of [Dune Under Sunset](../../characters/dune-under-sunset.md). He informs them that they were found by a trade caravan and are lucky to be alive. When he tells them that they are in [Kuv'narash](../../places/villages/kuvnarash.md), it becomes apparent that they aren't even in the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md). Dune providing them with a map of the [Independent States of the Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../maps/independent-states-of-the-nilsavnic-alliance.md) only serves to drive this point home.

Dune fetches [Zolné Windclaw](../../characters/zolne-windclaw.md) to his house, introducing her to the party. She converses with them behind her cloth covered face, hiding her true identity as a leonin. Finding their situation and disposition curious she agrees to help them west to the next settlement, free of charge. The party don't argue.

Heading west out of [Kuv'narash](../../places/villages/kuvnarash.md) the party begin traversing the dunes. Here they encounter three wolves, entering into battle. Zolné proves her worth, revealing her head and leonin lineage in the process. She calls upon the spirits of her ancestors to focus a lion onto herself while [Keranios](../../characters/keranios.md) helps her with two of the lions, aided by [Marik Kaligavone](../../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) and her Thorn Whip cantrip. [Vētrall Astérr](../../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) take turns being attacked by the third lion before Vētrall's mind magic shatters its mind, killing it.

The party continue their journey west.

### [MC03](../../sessions/MC03.md)

The party continue to follow [Zolné Windclaw](../../characters/zolne-windclaw.md) through the Kas'ran Desert, west towards [Côtedouce](../../places/towns/cotedouce.md).

That evening they realise they are being tailed by hyenas, including two giant hyenas. Zolné persuades the party to wait until sundown to attack them, when it is not so hot. When the time is right, Zolné turns around and begins combat.

Ultimately the party kill all of the hyenas, three of which [Valan Shadowgaze](../../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) snipes with his longbow from great distance, impressing Zolné who calls him a true warrior. Not long after this the party bed down for the night, sharing stories about who they are and how they got here. Zolné dismisses their tale of how they got to the desert as a drug fuelled dream.

The following day Zolné spots a wandering dust devil, explaining what it is and advising they try to give it a wide berth. They proceed around it to the south in a sneaky manner, succeeding in avoiding attracting its attention.

The next day Zolné spots some standing stones, indicating the trail from [Côtedouce](../../places/towns/cotedouce.md) to Ouvraux. Zolné tells the party that they should reach [Côtedouce](../../places/towns/cotedouce.md) by nightfall. On the road north they come across two traders heading to Ouvraux to sell textiles. Zolné wishes them well, returning a gesture of well wishes in the [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md) religious style.

Upon seeing [Côtedouce](../../places/towns/cotedouce.md) on the coast over a dune, Zolné says that this is where she parts way with the party, as the town is no place for her. She expresses her surprise that the party survived the desert and wishes them well. The party thanks her for her help. Zolné leaves them and goes back the way she came.

The party proceed into [Côtedouce](../../places/towns/cotedouce.md), looking for somewhere to drink and sleep before hoping to catch a ship out of the desert. These plans are scuppered when they are arrested and jailed by the [Republic Guard](../../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md).

Following their escape orchestrated by [Grouper](../../characters/grouper.md), he provides them with information of a [Kavallos Fleet](../../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) plot to sabotage the town's defences ahead of a larger naval attack, advising the party to take this information to the arch-mage [Oriel Elsandoral](../../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) to earn her trust and secure safe passage out of the town. They take a Kavallos longsword that [Grouper](../../characters/grouper.md) gives them to the arch-mage, offering their services. Oriel explains that if they help prevent this plot from transpiring, they will earn her favour.
