## Summary

For unknown reasons, [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) has chosen to reach out to [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) directly. Typically the [gods](../../gods/gods.md) do not do this - stories of people having interactions with the [gods](../../gods/gods.md) is dismissed as legend or hearsay.

## History

### [AA01](../../sessions/completed/AA01.md)

#### Whisper [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) Chat 1

As part of the [Astorrel Graduation](astorrel-graduation.md), [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) pledged themselves to [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) at [Diamond Prime](../../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md). This was done to prove that they practiced [The Order of the Diamond](../../organisations/the-order-of-the-diamond.md).

While praying in front of the statue of [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) (in mortal form as a hawk), Whisper noticed the statue grow brighter to the point of hurting their eyes. The female voice of [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) echoed throughout the temple.

### [AA02](../../sessions/completed/AA02.md)

#### Whisper [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) Chat 2

On the night of graduation day, [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) returns to [Diamond Prime](../../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md) while the rest of the party either goes to bed or handles other business. She intentionally waits until her journey there is not observed.

Praying once again at the shrine to [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md), she grows impatient for another sign, before the statue begins to glow and the female voice of [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) is heard again.

*[Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md):*
> What is it that you seek?

*[Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md):*
> Closure.

*[Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md):*
> If that's what you wish.

### [AA04](../../sessions/completed/AA04.md)

#### Whisper [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) Chat 3

While staying in [Arnaside](../../places/villages/arnaside.md) overnight in the [Head & Haft](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/head-and-haft.md), [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) wakes up. They see their party sleeping inside the tavern, but a light outside distracts them. They make their way to the door quietly and step outside.

It is quiet out and the wind is notably absent. Looking around they see a hawk on the edge of the next building over's roof, resembling the shrine to [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) in [Diamond Prime](../../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md) - golden and shining through its many gemstones. It is casting light around it.

As Whisper approaches it, there is a flash of light. They suddenly find themself high in the sky above a desert landscape bathed in sunlight. To their side they see a large hawk who they presume is [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md). Getting their bearings they realise that they are also a bird, flying alongside [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) over the desert.

As they fly together they approach a village (Kuv'narash) and descend.

*[Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md):*
> This is Kuv'narash.

It is made of dried dirt, a maze of connected buildings with open windows. The people here are predominantly the lesser races of [South East Kardan](../../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md) - mostly tabaxi and dragonborn. The people they fly past look poor and are simply trying to make ends meet.

Flying through the streets, Whisper and Valnos descend on a building, landing on its window sill. This open hole in the side of the building gives them a view inside. Here Whisper sees a family of tabaxi, living in cramped conditions. The colour of their fur and markings is immediately recognisable to Whisper, matching their own.

Whisper sees a mother in childbirth, her cubs emerging one by one as another female tabaxi helps her, moving them onto a blanket. The last cub is born, the runt of the litter, crying as it makes its way into the world.

*[Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md):*
> That's you.

A male tabaxi makes his way over to the mother and the cubs. He kisses Whisper on the forehead before embracing the mother. Whisper doesn't recognise this figure as their father.

The dream ends. Whisper wakes up in the morning by the fire, feeling content and energised.

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/C2-astorrel-agents.md)

As [Brooke](../../players/brooke.md) is no longer playing in the [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/C2-astorrel-agents.md) campaign, this storyline has been shelved. These are my original plans in case she ever reprises [Whisper on the Breeze](../../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md):

[Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md) continues to give Whisper dreams of past events, taking them through events of their life from alternative perspectives. The idea is to provide more context on their upbringing and [Shout on the Breeze](../../characters/shout-on-the-breeze.md)'s role in their life.

Whisper's biological father died while Whisper was very young. Shout is their adoptive father, which they did not know.

Shout should be portrayed as someone making hard decisions to support their clan, but ultimately abandons them as the pressure of providing for them becomes too much. He should come across as sympathetic but not in a way that invalidates Whisper's negative feelings towards him.

Ultimately these dreams should lead Whisper to knowing where their father is. There should be a moment prior to this where Whisper thinks they see their father on duty, but it is merely a similar looking tabaxi [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).
