## Summary

While the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party attempts to make their way to [Northhaven](../../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md) following the capture of [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md), [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) comes to their rescue.

[Sarleen Truestriker](../../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md), an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) in [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md), finds the party along the [River Humar](../../places/topography/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) and leads them back to her [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md), [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md).

## History

### Between Sessions

Not long after being captured, Wrenn is woken up by the movement of the horse he is draped over. Keeping his composure, he manages to cast Sending with the copper wire coiled around his wrist, contacting [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) ([Goshawk squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) lead) to explain his capture and the danger the party is in:

> Help! Captured by bandits. Please help my friends! Hunted by [Astornox](../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md). They know information that will save Astor. Get them to Elysia!

> Captured near [Frizthwaite](../../places/settlements/villages/frizthwaite.md). Heading to [Northhaven](../../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md) by boat or road. Blue firbolg, grey human--

Hidaar, trusting what his colleague Wrenn has told him, and particularly concerned by the potential stakes, dispatches his [Astorrel Squad Hands](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) in search of the party. They split up, each taking a different route from [Ulburn](../../places/settlements/villages/ulburn.md) towards [Frizthwaite](../../places/settlements/villages/frizthwaite.md). Their orders are to search for a blue firbolg and a grey human, and escort them back to him so that he may help them seek [sanctuary](../../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [Northhaven](../../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md).

### [PR14](../../sessions/PR14.md)

While camping on the eastern shore of the [River Humar](../../places/topography/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), the party meet [Sarleen Truestriker](../../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md) as the sun rises and they are getting ready for the day ahead.

They explain that they're an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) in [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md), and that Hidaar wants to help them get into [Northhaven](../../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md). She offers to escort them to him.

The party is reluctant to accept help from a stranger, particularly one that knows who they are, but she convinces them of her trustworthiness when she reveals that Wrenn messaged Hidaar after being captured by [The Crimson Blades](../../organisations/criminals/the-crimson-blades.md), indicating a level of trust. They agree to go with her.

The party travels along the eastern bank of the river, the boat now too big for all of them to use.

At nightfall they make camp between the river and some cliffs. During the night while Sarleen and [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) are on watch, gnolls attack from the cliffs above. The rest of the party is woken up, and together they dispatch the gnolls before returning to sleep for the remainder of the night.

### [PR15](../../sessions/PR15.md)

The following day [Sarleen Truestriker](../../characters/sarleen-truestriker.md) continues to lead the party towards [Ulburn](../../places/settlements/villages/ulburn.md). Several hours from [Ulburn](../../places/settlements/villages/ulburn.md) the party, having walked for 8 hours, decides to camp for the night along the riverside rather than push on and risk exhaustion.

First thing in the morning they set off again. Sarleen escorts the party into [Ulburn](../../places/settlements/villages/ulburn.md), leading them through a side street to avoid [Astornox](../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) outside of Humar's Knee on the main street. They emerge further down the street on the other side of the [Ulburn Astorrel House](../../places/buildings/government/ulburn-astorrel-house.md) and make their way inside.

Here Sarleen introduces them to [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md), the [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) lead. Sarleen helps to cut through some of the party's attempted lies about who they are or what they've been through.

As Hidaar tries to get a deeper understanding of why [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) thought the party was so important, Sarleen is asked to leave the room so that they may talk in confidence.

When Sarleen is called back in, Hidaar orders her to make her way into [Northhaven](../../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md), meet with [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) in the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/government/zenith-spire.md), and inform them of what is going on. They give Sarleen their [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) badge and send them on their way, expressing that time is of the essence.

Sarleen leaves at once, exchanging a brief goodbye to the party before disappearing out of the front door back into [Ulburn](../../places/settlements/villages/ulburn.md), headed for [Northhaven](../../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md) with haste.
