## Summary

[Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) are natural rivals, with the same superior officer in [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md).

## History

### [AA01](../../sessions/AA01.md)

When the party met their new superior officer, [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md) placed them in a squad together which they eventually named [Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md). He placed his other four subordinates in a squad which they eventually named [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md).

Through inference, the players likely realise that they are not only competing amongst themselves to stand out, but also against their sister squad.

### [AA02](../../sessions/AA02.md)

Upon arriving back at [Bryce Morton's Office](../../places/buildings/government/bryce-mortons-office.md) the following day, [Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) size each other up, seeing what they have spent their money on. [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md) reveals that both [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Darius Dunn](../../characters/darius-dunn.md) have both received the Exceptional Trainee Bonus, using this as justification for making them both the first acting [Astorrel Squad Leads](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md).

Both squads begin their first missions:

| Squad | Acting Lead | Mission | Bounty | Time Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | ---:| --- |
| [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) | [Darius Dunn](../../characters/darius-dunn.md) | Investigate Bear Attacks in Hartsgarth | 30 gp | 10 days |
| [Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) | [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | [Check Logging in Arnaside](check-logging-in-arnaside.md) | 20 gp | 14 days |

### [AA06](../../sessions/AA06.md)

When [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) return to [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md) for their second mission, Bryce hands them their invite letter to [Nature's Battle 28](natures-battle-28.md) ([L-AA-01](../../letters/L-AA-01.md)). He tells them that the same invite to the tournament has been extended to [Ruby squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md), a point of pride for him. Knowing that they are competing factors into [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)'s decision to compete.

On their way out of [Auric Rise](../../places/buildings/government/auric-rise.md), [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) spots [Darius Dunn](../../characters/darius-dunn.md) entering [the Mission's End](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-missions-end.md). Wanting to spend more time with him, she splits from the party and follows him inside. Here she finds the rest of [Ruby squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md), who tell her of their successful mission to Hartsgarth where they killed several brown bears in a den near the village. They also briefly discuss their invite to the tournament, which they are excited to accept.

### [AA07](../../sessions/AA07.md)

On the first day of [Nature's Battle 28](natures-battle-28.md) [Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) meet the [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) higher-ups outside the [Zenith Spire](../../places/buildings/government/zenith-spire.md) along with many other [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) who are here to see them off. [Ruby squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) arrive not long after.

[Penance Zahiri](../../characters/penance-zahiri.md) is excited to compete against them. [Morgan Caithness](../../characters/morgan-caithness.md) doesn't care who she fights, simply wishing to win each match in turn. [Darius Dunn](../../characters/darius-dunn.md) is flustered by [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md)'s presence, stammering through his hope that [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) will be knocked out before [Ruby squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) have to fight them. Both sides wish each other the best of luck.

[Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) teleports [Ruby squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) first, the five disappearing from the square in an instant. When Mergin returns he does the same to bring [Canary squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) to [Eskrigg](../../places/settlements/cities/eskrigg.md).

### [AA08](../../sessions/AA08.md)

At the introduction to [Nature's Battle 28](natures-battle-28.md), [Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) are drawn together when [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) randomly draws the tournament brackets. This means they are due to fight in the first round of the tournament. The news causes waves in the room as the already unorthodox two squads from the same division of the [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) are now paired off immediately.

Both squads spend some time discussing their upcoming match. Both [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Penance Zahiri](../../characters/penance-zahiri.md) revel in the possibility of a showdown while everyone else is more reserved, just wanting to win and advance. [Redwyn Humpledopper](../../characters/redwyn-humpledopper.md) tries to persuade [Darius Dunn](../../characters/darius-dunn.md) to slow down his squad so that she can win, offering to split her tournament winnings with him so they can retire to the countryside together. When Darius is bemused by the suggestion, not realising Redwyn's feelings for him, she walks off.

The match between [Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Ruby Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) takes place. [Canary Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) wins decisively.

In the aftermath the victors help the losers to their feet, both sides casting healing magic to help with their injuries. There is a real sense of camaraderie after their bout, particularly between [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Penance Zahiri](../../characters/penance-zahiri.md).

At the end of the day they all retire to [Geor's Door](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/geors-door.md) where they drink and discuss their battle, going so far as to share their original strategies formulated before the battle. It is clear that the fight only deepened the squads' friendships and respect for each other.
