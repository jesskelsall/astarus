## Summary

[The Morning Chasers](../../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) were contracted by [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) to search for signs of a [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) impact in Silethwaite. They turned up little information. With [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s experience with the [Goldreach meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) wants the organisation questioned again.

## History

### [PR27](../../sessions/completed/PR27.md)

Following [the meteoric threat](../the-meteoric-threat.md) briefing in [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) gives [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) their first [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission. She notes that this is a small mission to give them a feel for the process of completing missions, particularly for [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) who has just been promoted to [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md).

The party are told to speak with [the Morning Chasers](../../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md), lead by [Janneke Borflast](../../characters/janneke-borflast.md). They may be able to learn more information about their trip to Silethwaite due to their experience with the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). Elysia directs them to the [Sunrise District](../../places/districts/sunrise-district.md) in [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md).

With only the rest of the day to complete the mission in, the party leave [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) in search of [the Morning Chasers](../../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md).

### [PR28](../../sessions/completed/PR28.md)

The party make their way to the [Sunset District](../../places/districts/sunset-district.md), finding [the Dog's Groke](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md) thanks to the help of commoners who point them in the right direction.

Seeing little through the window to suggest occupancy but hearing a faint voice from inside, the party knocks on the door. When nobody answers, they resolve to break in. [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) dives through a front window, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) climbs in after her, while [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) blow open a door round the back of the building.

Inside they face [Janneke Borflast](../../characters/janneke-borflast.md) who comes downstairs with her bow drawn, furious at the break in. When Torbra tries to hide from her she puts tow arrows in her chest. When the rest of [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) emerges and tries to de-escalate the situation she surrenders.

Janneke attempts to hide the presence of [Kieran Bennington](../../characters/kieran-bennington.md) and [Slaine Alabaster](../../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) upstairs, claiming to be here alone. Thanea subtly casts Detect Thoughts, quickly learning of their presence upstairs, while [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) sneaks upstairs.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and Saoirse discover the pair's presence upstairs, finding Slaine very ill in bed. Kieran initially won't let [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) near Slaine, who is not lucid. When he does show moments of clarity he is panicked, worrying about the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) he possesses.

The party learn that on their trip to Silethwaite they found the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) in a clearing on the edge of the [Great Sile Woods](../../places/forests/great-sile-woods.md). The clearing looked man-made. There was also a sense that something had lived there, but nothing recent. Slaine found and took the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). As the adventurers didn't know what it was, Janneke let him keep it, assuming he would sell it once home. Instead he became increasingly obsessed with it, eventually turning violent when people tries to take it from him.

[Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) manage to convince [the Morning Chasers](../../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) to let them help. They earn their trust by talking of their experiences of dealing with [meteoric watchers](../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) and the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), as well as being [magicborn on the run](magicborn-on-the-run.md) from the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), which comes up when Kieran confides in them that he is a [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md).

When Kieran reveals that Slaine is physically stuck to the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) by the hand, the party feel it is essential that they separate him from it before it kills him. Kieran worries that any effort may kill him, but they are out of options.

Kieran volunteers to cast Dispel Magic on the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). When he does so it collapses into dust and transforms [Slaine Alabaster](../../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) into a [Meteoric Humanoid](../../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md). It stands up and stabs down at Kieran with its newly formed blade arms.

### [PR29](../../sessions/completed/PR29.md)

As [Slaine Alabaster](../../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) turns into a [Meteoric Humanoid](../../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md), [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) engage him in combat. Initially they try to subdue him, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) grabbing hold of him while [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) wraps [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s rope around him. After Torbra fails to push him out of the first floor bedroom window, it becomes apparent that he is stronger than they realised, and that a protracted battle will end badly.

With [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and then Thanea falling unconscious at the creature's hands, it takes the effort of everyone present to overpower the creature. Torbra lands a killing blow, scattering the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) affixed to Slaine's body, revealing a fleshy mangled corpse that doesn't resemble the Slaine. [Janneke Borflast](../../characters/janneke-borflast.md) cries uncontrollably at the sight of Slaine's body.

While the party lick their wounds, the [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) is not finished. It starts to coalesce in a pile near the body, which Torbra notices. She scoops up what she can and places it into her iron pot, causing the outstanding dust to float through the air in a circular vortex, tracing a trail into the pot's interior.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) tries heating the dust with Produce Flame to subdue it, but it does little. As a result she throws the pot across the room, scattering half of its contents across the floor. She watches as the dust left in the opening of the sideways pot slinks deeper inside, tipping the pot upright in the process, while the dust on the floor starts moving towards the pot.

[Kieran Bennington](../../characters/kieran-bennington.md) rushes over to the pot and casts Dispel Magic, rendering all of the dust inert and motionless. [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) scoop up most of the dust and place it in Torbra's pot.

### [PR30](../../sessions/completed/PR30.md)

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) retrieves [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) from [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md). The pair run back across the city to [the Dog's Groke](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md).

Here Elysia asks [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) what happened, particularly interested in the corpse of [Slaine Alabaster](../../characters/slaine-alabaster.md). Torbra recants the series of events leading up to and including their fight with the [Meteoric Watcher](../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md). Elysia collects the iron pot full of [Meteoric Dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), wishing to return it to [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) immediately.

Elysia also sees [Kieran Bennington](../../characters/kieran-bennington.md) and [Janneke Borflast](../../characters/janneke-borflast.md). She chastises the latter for keeping the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) secret from [Astral squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), asking her if she was hiding anything else. She assures Elysia that she was not.

With Elysia leaving, [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) carries out Janneke's wish for Slaine's corpse to be burned. Despite Elysia warning her not to burn the building down, she burns it on the landing upstairs, setting the floor alight and causing it to give way. Slaine's body crashed through the floor, down to a table in the tavern below, setting the table and floor on fire. Collectively the party manage to put the fire out before the building sets on fire, but Elysia is furious that [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) almost immediately ignored her warning.

[Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) accompany Elysia back to [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md). Here Elysia keeps the iron pot of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) and compares it to the pouch of dust that [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) handed over to her, finding it similar.

[Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is given instructions on how to write her mission report, which will allow her to formally close the mission and get them their pay. While Elysia is out of the room she sits with Saoirse and Thanea. They provide a mostly truthful account of events, but all agree not to mention that [Kieran Bennington](../../characters/kieran-bennington.md) is [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), instead lying that [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) cast Dispel Magic on the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md).

Satisfied with the report, Elysia collects it and pays [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) for their mission.
