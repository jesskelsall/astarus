After discussing how competing will affect their next mission, Bryce reassures them that the tournament is their priority if they choose to compete - the mission can wait. After a discussion they choose to compete, responding to [Liabella Peacock](../../characters/liabella-peacock.md) by letter sent from [Astpost Northhaven](../../places/buildings/shops/astpost-northhaven.md).

### [PR21](../../sessions/completed/PR21.md)
