## Summary

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) is an [aasimar](../../lineages/aasimar.md), but she doesn't know it yet. Often unwelcome prophetic dreams have been present throughout her life, and she has a sense that something about herself doesn't add up. She will learn the truth within herself.

## History

### [PR00](../../sessions/PR00.md)

*See: [Thanea Deva Dream 1](../../dreams/deva-thanea-1.md)*

### [PR06](../../sessions/PR06.md)

*See: [Thanea Deva Dream 2](../../dreams/deva-thanea-2.md)*

### [PR07](../../sessions/PR07.md)

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)'s dream and her conviction that it is prophetic leads the party to find [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), where they find a [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater containing the [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor. When the party observes, its glow changes from bright white to purple, much like the flames of the forest did in her dream.

### [PR10](../../sessions/PR10.md)

After leaving [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) by horse and cart, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) laments at how her prophetic dreams always end with her in trouble.

### [PR11](../../sessions/PR11.md)

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) remarks that [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) is supposed to be "the crazy one" due to her dreams.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) tells [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) that her prophetic dream of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) helped lead the party to its location in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md). She asks Wrenn if he is aware of anyone else that has such dreams, but he is not.

He tells [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) that once the trouble they are in has passed, he would like to introduce her to someone that has visions of the future, though they have them while awake. He references an old word for the phenomenon: seer.

### [PR14](../../sessions/PR14.md)

*See: [Thanea Deva Dream 3](../../dreams/deva-thanea-3.md)*  
*[Thanea Morlay unlocks her Protector [Aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) abilities]*

### [PR15](../../sessions/PR15.md)

In private [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) asks [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) if they know anything about dreams that become reality. They don't, but mention that Wrenn's squad, [Astral Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), contains someone with similar sounding experiences.

### [PR22](../../sessions/PR22.md)

[Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) uses her downtime in [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) to research her prophetic dreams in [Hawk's Perch](../../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md). She finds mention of those with foresight (seers), with the text suggesting that it may be a form of magical manifestation.

She also tries to research humanoids with wings, but only finds information on aarakocra.

### [PR24](../../sessions/PR24.md)

During [Starfall Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s [Nature's Battle 28](natures-battle-28.md) match against [Gloom Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md), [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) comes incredibly close to death while facing off against [Norma Collarbone](../../characters/norma-collarbone.md) at close range. She digs deep, activating her [aasimar](../../lineages/aasimar.md) Radiant Soul feature for the first time. She sprouts yellow-white radiant wings, taking flight over the arena.

This display is a surprise for everyone present, including [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) and [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) who are conscious to see it ([Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is not). The audience collectively gasps before falling silent, watching as she flies effortlessly around the arena.

Thanea immediately finds her confidence in the air, casting Magic Missile twice while airborne, to great effect.

Her flight ends abruptly when [Norma Collarbone](../../characters/norma-collarbone.md) summons a bestial spirit above her, which falls down onto her. As she was already close to unconsciousness, the blow is enough to tip her over the edge, causing her wings to fade and her body to plummet to the ground.
