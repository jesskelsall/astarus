## Summary

As [magicborn on the run](magicborn-on-the-run.md), the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain.md) party seek [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md). They are offered it by [Garrick Rose](../../characters/garrick-rose.md), [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md). While here they must find a way to resolve their conflict with the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

## History

### [PR18](../../sessions/PR18.md)

As the part and [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) reach the gatehouse of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), Sparrow tells [Garrick Rose](../../characters/garrick-rose.md), the sergeant on duty, that the party is seeking [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

After hearing how they have been running from the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) as suspected [magicborn](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), he offers them [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md), stating his rules, which the party accept. They part ways with their clothes and belongings which are secured in chests. They are able to take a few approved items into [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) with them.

The party are placed in [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) quarters on the first floor of [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), where they will be locked inside. However they are able to leave at any time if they wish. Visitors he permits to enter will be able to do so without the party's approval. Meals are brought to them twice per day and Garrick offers to help them with any needs they have while they are in there.

Garrick makes it clear that the offer lasts as long as he is willing to guard them, which he must do from a chair outside their quarters 24/7. His subordinate guards will be running errands and helping him while he does so. Once he tires of this, he will rescind the offer and they'll be forced to leave.

On the first evening the party is visited by [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) who sees the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) and inquires about the circumstances surrounding their acquisition of it. She implores them to keep it a secret and tell no-one.

In the morning after breakfast the party is visited by [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) who is concerned about the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) the party has killed, and what brings them here. Levelle and [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) talk about [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md) and how his plight fits into [the firbolg controversy](the-firbolg-controversy.md) as a whole.

### [PR19](../../sessions/PR19.md)

The party remains in [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md).

They are visited by [Carras Southroot](../../characters/carras-southroot.md) and [Norsha Costello](../../characters/norsha-costello.md) who question them about [Wrenn Piznarck](../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md)'s last known whereabouts as well as what he was doing in [Goldreach](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) in the first place. They are honest in their answers.

[Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) visits, providing the party with some writing supplies and [Twenties](../../mechanics/roleplay/games/twenties.md) dice, as well as a copy of [Northhaven Town Crier Script 312-5-06](../../papers/letters/northhaven-town-crier-script-312-5-06.md) which shows how the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) are demanding the release of the party from [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

On hearing about another firbolg, [Rowan Great Sile](../../characters/rowan-great-sile.md) visits to speak with [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) about her clan and their location.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) receives a letter from [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) ([Letter to Wizira from Levelle Tristwix](../../papers/letters/letter-to-wizira-from-levelle-tristwix.md)) which details the efforts Levelle is going to trying to get [Wizira's Father](../../characters/wiziras-father.md) from the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) conscription process. Later they arrive with [Mindira Flibfae](../../characters/mindira-flibfae.md) to inform the party of the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) trial over [the firbolg controversy](the-firbolg-controversy.md).

With the party offered as stakes in the trial, either outcome will see the party leaving [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) - either in custody of the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) or [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). Both Levelle and Mindira implore the party to aid their efforts to win the trial so that they don't fall to the custody of the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).

### [AA05](../../sessions/AA05.md)

On return to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) from [Arnaside](../../places/villages/arnaside.md), [Canary Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) witness a stand-off between the [Astorrel guards](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) and a contingent of [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md). It appears they are here waiting for the release of some people (the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain.md) party) from [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

### [PR20](../../sessions/PR20.md)

The [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain.md) party left their [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) to attend the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) trial of [the firbolg controversy](the-firbolg-controversy.md) in [The Circle](../../places/buildings/the-circle.md).

Upon their return, now no longer [magicborn on the run](magicborn-on-the-run.md), the party sought a role in a military organisation of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) led the party out of [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) and put them up for the night in [The Mission's End](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-missions-end.md), ending their [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md).
