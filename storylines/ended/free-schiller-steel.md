## Summary

After [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) competed in [Nature's Battle 28](natures-battle-28.md), [Bernard Horace Schiller](../../characters/bernard-horace-schiller.md) provides him with the means to acquire a [Schiller steel](../../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) weapon for free.

## History

## [AA10](../../sessions/AA10.md)

On the day of the [Nature's Battle 28](natures-battle-28.md) final, [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) comes down for breakfast in the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md) and is given a letter ([AA10-L-1](../../letters/AA10-L-1.md)) by an [Astorrel member](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md). This provides Noon with the "family rate" prices for all weapons offered, as well as the provision to gain one free of charge for his own use.

He informs [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) that he has the means of acquiring [Schiller steel](../../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) should they want to buy weapons made of it. Ahsha realises that Noon is part of the family that makes the weapons. The party gets excited at the prospect and chooses to spend their morning looking at examples of the weapons.

At [Schiller Steel Eskrigg](../../places/buildings/shops/schiller-steel-eskrigg.md) the party meets [Callum Briar](../../characters/callum-briar.md), the shopkeeper. He is terrified and submissive of Noon throughout. Ahsha gets to hold a [Schiller steel](../../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) greataxe.

When Noon asks to buy the greataxe and 3 daggers, Callum provides the "family rate" price which is well in excess of what the party can afford. Noon tries to convince him to put the greataxe on his father's tab, but Callum is too fearful of losing his life for the transgression. Ultimately the party walk out of the shop empty handed.

## [AA12](../../sessions/AA12.md)

Following [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)'s exploits in the [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers ([Syntenne Spies in Eskrigg](syntenne-spies-in-eskrigg.md)), [Noon Schiller](../../characters/noon-schiller.md) returns to [Schiller Steel Eskrigg](../../places/buildings/shops/schiller-steel-eskrigg.md) to retrieve the [Schiller Steel](../../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) greataxe. He is determined to take it at any cost, still furious by his powerlessness at the hands of [Nia](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md).

On arrival he makes [Callum Briar](../../characters/callum-briar.md) open the door. Noon makes it clear that he is leaving with the weapon and has no intention of paying for it. Callum once again begs with Noon to not do this, fearing for his life. Noon couldn't care less. Callum resigns himself to his fate, turning a blind eye by going into the back room while Noon is left alone with the weapon on the counter.

Noon leaves with the weapon, taking it back with him to the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md). Once back he leaves it with [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md)' gear. She wakes in the morning to find it, thanking Noon with a big hug before breakfast.
