## Summary

[Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) Veritacris have infiltrated [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md). [Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), [Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md), and [Castien Eladan](../../characters/castien-eladan.md) are searching for another [Aasimar](../../lineages/aasimar.md), and they think they may have found one.

## History

### [PR27](../../sessions/completed/PR27.md)

While under the effects of [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) runs through the night time streets of [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md) looking for a place to avoid others and let her hallucinations rest. She sits against a wall on a quiet street.

Here she overhears [Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) and [Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md) talking intently but quietly about their need to escape. Allisa then notices Saoirse, approaching her. This gives Saoirse a look at her. She notices Allisa's copper armour pieces as well as her full-face helmet. She also notices Xavier wearing a hood and leathers.

Allisa is surprised by Saoirse, not expecting to find another divine presence in the city, though she feels her fallen [aasimar](../../lineages/aasimar.md) nature which feels "off". She tries to help Saoirse who asks who she is, scaring her off.

Though she would not know it, Saoirse has unwittingly crossed paths with [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) Veritacris who have infiltrated [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md).

### [AA10](../../sessions/completed/AA10.md)

[Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) enter the [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers in order to clear out hostile rats so that [Barthon Ironfist](../../characters/barthon-ironfist.md) can set up an underground pit fighting ring. While fighting rats, the party find the bloated corpse of [Castien Eladan](../../characters/castien-eladan.md), which washes down a sewer tunnel toward them.

[Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) turns the corpse over to find a bloated humanoid dressed in destitute rags. She finds no obvious cause of death.

After combat, [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) further examines the body, finding some coin and an [Astorrel Lieutenant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-lieutenant.md) badge. The party initially suspects the body was that of an [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) officer, but when Ephaine notices their half-elven ears, the body makes even less sense.

Back on the surface, the party reconvene with Barthon who is disturbed by the sight of the corpse. He pleads with the party to walk away, ominously implying that they are about to get involved with something they would rather not. This only causes them to double down for more information.

Barthon tells them that a [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spy ([Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md)) infiltrated his pit fighting ring before it was shut down. He helped his leader ([Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)) extort him into aiding them, threatening to harm his family, particularly his daughter, if he did not comply. To keep his family safe he did as he was told.

Barthon provided the spies with information about the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), but most notably information about the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)'s customs and culture. He tells the party that he was surprised that while their geographic knowledge of [South East Kardan](../../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md) is stellar, they know almost nothing about the kingdom's culture.

He reveals that the section of sewer that he asked the party to clear out was in fact for the spies' use. This angers the party, now implicated in a Syntenne conspiracy against their knowledge. Barthon is sympathetic but ultimately felt he had to protect his family, who he has already moved to [Mockerkin](../../places/towns/mockerkin.md) for their protection. The party debates what to do with him before telling him to leave [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md) immediately and be with his family.

The party debate what to do with the corpse. They agree that they must report this to the [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) as per their military duties.

### [AA11](../../sessions/completed/AA11.md)

[Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) sound the alarm over what they have learned about the [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spies and the potential for a conspiracy involving the [Nature's Battle 27](natures-battle-27.md) final match. They go to [Vorrinel's Stand](../../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) and inform both [Legacy Aranius](../../characters/legacy-aranius.md) and [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md).

Legacy orders the building locked down. He involves [Tanin Arnous](../../characters/tanin-arnous.md) who helps to coordinate a bolstering of the [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) protecting the arena. Legacy also asks Tanin to fetch a Truthseeker. Ronvyn urges the party to find more evidence before the day is out, or the disruption their accusations have caused will come back to haunt them. He officially gives them orders to do so, so they head back out, looking to investigate the sewer entrances around the arena.

Heading to one of the less protected sewer entrances, [Ephaine Seren](../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) finds robed and disguised [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) stationed on rooftops overlooking the door leading to the sewer grate. While wild shaped into a bird she checks the other two sewer entrances and finds a similar level of protection and no visible issues.

While encircling the first area she notices a hooded figure ([Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md)) entering a doorway. After surprising an [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) on a nearby rooftop he informs her that he didn't see anyone, but now needs to report it. Ephaine tells him that [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) intends to go after him, which he also must report. This doesn't deter the party.

After descending into the sewer, [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) fails to notice Xavier emerging from a room, causing him to flee deeper into the sewers. She manages to catch up to him, grappling him. He submits, putting on a frightened demeanour and wishing to talk. Meanwhile [Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) is sat nearby, disguised as a commoner.

The party begin questioning Xavier, learning that a small group of Veritacris are here to observe the tournament final as they heard of an angel ([Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md)) competing in the semi-final. He truthfully tells them that their intention is to verify her existence one way or another before leaving.

The party is sceptical of the story. Pressing for more details, Xavier eventually reveals that Allisa has spent over 100 years searching each civilisation in turn for an angel, as she is one herself ([aasimar](../../lineages/aasimar.md)) and no longer wants to be alone. Unfortunately this isn't enough of a reason for the party to allow Xavier to get away as if they had never found him, so they tie him up and prepare to haul him back to [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) at [Vorrinel's Stand](../../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md).

[Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) drops her disguise, revealing her real appearance including her armour and weapons. She dives towards Xavier, trying to grab him from Ahsha's grasp. She fails, opting to flee regardless, casting Dimension Door and disappearing into a nearby [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md) street. She is gone before the party can even react.

While trying to leave the sewers with their prisoner, the party come across a group of [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) who refuse to let them pass. [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) have hidden Xavier's head and do not mention the nature of their business.

### [AA12](../../sessions/completed/AA12.md)

[Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) manage to get past the [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) in the [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers thanks to the timely arrival of [Yialdred Korina](../../characters/yialdred-korina.md), an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) on guard duty that followed the commotion of running [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md). She was able to use Channel Divinity: Order's Demand to convince them that an [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad's business is none of theirs.

Korina, presenting herself as an [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) to the party, joins them in hauling [Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md) out of the sewers. Rather than emerging up the ladder into the small room they expected, they inadvertently pass through an Arcane Gate into an inn cellar. Here [Gwenhwyfar Carew](../../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md), calling herself "Lia", greets them and informs them that she is an [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) Truthseeker and that she is here to relive them of their prisoner, rather than taking him to [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md).

Lia acts as a friend to the bewildered party who are extremely suspicious of her. After she asks them what happened in the sewers and what they know, to which they reply honestly, she asks them to set Xavier down against a large cask of ale so she can talk to him. [Ahsha Sallas](../../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) is wary of Lia, warning her against killing him.

Lia asks for Xavier's cooperation in elvish before casting Detect Thoughts on him, reading his thoughts and memories. Through this she learns of everything Xavier told [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) in the sewers, and his and [Allisa Balsatra](../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)'s goals in [Eskrigg](../../places/cities/eskrigg.md).

She chastises the party for how much they know, calling it a complication, and referring to loose ends, before executing [Xavier Raloven](../../characters/xavier-raloven.md) by casting Disintegrate on him. The mood in the room goes sombre and Lia drops her kind demeanour.

The party are threatened implicitly with the same fate if they don't cooperate. Lia makes it clear that they will leave this place and never speak of what happened today, as if the events never happened. Lia makes it exceptionally clear that the presence of [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spies within the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) threatens the Astor-Syntenne War armistice agreement, and that what she is doing allows the continued peace & prosperity not possible while actively at war - particularly the [Blade's Rest](../../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival currently taking place.

[Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and Korina reluctantly agree to her terms, leaving via another Arcane Gate. With the dramatic execution of their prisoner and nothing more to show for their day's effort, [Canary squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) give up the hunt for spies, agreeing that there is nothing more they can do due to the enforced cover-up. They go about the rest of their day while Korina goes back to her guard duty.
