## History

### [PR30](../../sessions/PR30.md)

Following the completion of [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s first mission ([Talk to the Morning Chasers](talk-to-the-morning-chasers.md)), [Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) debate which of the four offered missions to take next. [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) as [Astorrel Squad Lead](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) makes the decision to head to the Humar Estuary. This is partially motivated by its quick mission deadline and relatively high ratio pay.

### [PR31](../../sessions/PR31.md)

#### Day 1

[Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) gear up for their mission to the Humar Estuary. [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) considers how they might get there, first considering hiring a horse and cart before deciding to try and buy a rowing boat.

The party head to the west of the [Sunset District](../../places/districts/sunset-district.md), down to the docks lined with ships of all sizes conducting commerce. She finds several businesses that will sell her a boat for 50 gp. As an alternative she looks for a ship that might be willing to drop them off along their route.

Torbra finds [Dinua Costello](../../characters/dinua-costello.md), captain of [the Maiden's Accompaniment](../../places/ships/the-maidens-accompaniment.md), who is willing to transport them for 1 gp each (4 gp total). The party agree to the arrangement which will include them sleeping on the deck and jumping overboard once the ship is close to the Humar Estuary.

#### Day 2

On a day filled with heavy rain, low hanging clouds and gusting winds, around mid-morning the party jump overboard as instructed, plunging into the surprisingly deep and murky water below.

While [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) manages to hold her breath and re-surface with ease, everyone else begins to drown. She soon finds and rescues [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md). [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) begins to drown and is losing consciousness fast, while [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is out of breath but successfully swims to the surface herself. Quick thinking by Thanea to cast Light on her rope and lower it into the depths catch Saoirse's eye. Thanea and Torbra manage to pull Saoirse to the surface.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) uses Wild Shape to turn into a fish, making her way to land. The rest of the party follows her, struggling through the reeds and boggy terrain for a while before reaching relatively dry and firm ground.

### [PR32](../../sessions/PR32.md)

Now on dry land, the party realise that they have no idea where to go next. With no discernible landmarks except for a few trees and the [River Humar](../../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) behind them, they decide to take shelter under a large tree nearby, dry their clothes, and wait for the rain to [pas](../../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md)s.

After several hours the rain is not letting up but their clothes are drier. When [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is trying to figure out which direction to go next, [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) pulls out her [Meteoric Map of Astor](../../maps/meteoric-map-of-astor.md) and realises that it has been ruined by water damage. Torbra decides the party should head south west.

Travelling for most of the day, the party eventually see disturbances in the water ahead. As they get closer they begin to make out [Leithran Shack](../../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md) through the rainy mist. They hear [Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md) shouting for help fighting off crocodiles and rush to help. They are able to save Montel from death at the hands of a crocodile thanks to [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)'s Healing Word, and fight off the rest of the crocodiles present in the water around the shack.

### [PR33](../../sessions/PR33.md)

[Starfall squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) meet [Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../../characters/esme-leithran.md) in [Leithran Shack](../../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md). They spend the night together, getting to know each other, particularly the pair's struggles as elves trying to make a home in the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md).

During this time [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) asks them if they have seen anything strange or suspicious on their travels since leaving [Hyceodd](../../places/towns/hyceodd.md). [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) casts Minor Illusion to create images of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) and [Meteoric Watchers](../../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md). Montel replies that he has seen nothing of the kind, or anything crater-like.

### [PR34](../../sessions/PR34.md)

#### Day 4

[Starfall Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) leave [Leithran Shack](../../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md) in the morning with [Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../../characters/esme-leithran.md), who will accompany them while they complete their mission.

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) finds a forked stick for use with her Locate Object spell but is unable to detect a [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) within its area of effect. [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) uses Radiant Soul to fly high into the clear sky, getting the party's bearings two thirds of the way down the Humar Estuary peninsula. [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) decides that they should proceed south west.

After several fruitless hours the party reach the end of dry land, arriving near the [Carneid Inlet](../../places/seas-oceans/carneid-inlet.md). [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) uses [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md)'s suggestion of casting Locate Object with [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) in mind, noticing that her divining rod points north. Torbra trusts [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), so the party turn back north, travelling for the rest of the day.

The party camp on drier northern terrain away from the swampier areas in the south of the peninsula.

#### Day 5

Having casts Locate Object again the night before, the party follow [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md)'s diving rod north-northwest. After only an hour they arrive on the edge of a large round lake - the [Humar Meteorite crater](../../places/rivers-lakes/humar-meteorite-crater.md).

[Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) look out over the crater, finding it to be round and disrespectful of the undulating terrain around it. [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) examines the shore line, finding the same almost carved banks and a lack of reeds that indicate a steadily increasing depth.

When [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) casts Detect Magic and finds nothing she begins to swim toward the centre of the lake, much to the vocal worry of the rest of the party. She continues anyway, quickly losing her footing on the bottom. After a while she looks down, observing a dark and murky body of water with no sign of the bottom. As she is looking she notices a large shadow [pas](../../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md)s underneath her. She tells the party that she is in danger.

A giant crocodile breaches the surface of the water right next to [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), fitting part of her into its mouth.

### [PR35](../../sessions/PR35.md)

The giant crocodile bites down hard on [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), doing her great damage and pulling her underwater. When she tries to escape it knocks her unconscious with its tail. [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) swims into the lake to defend her. She is able to use her Stone Rune to subdue the crocodile, giving her a chance to pull [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) to the shore.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) tries to summon radiant wings but is only able to summon her usual Necrotic Shroud, frightening [Thanea Morlay](../../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and preventing her from acting quickly in support of Torbra and [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md).

As Torbra pulls [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) to the shore, the crocodile regains its mobility and swims over. It makes a large bite at [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md), snapping her torso while spinning her around, killing her. Her lifeless body splashes into the water. Saoirse blasts the crocodile away but it is able to circle back and take [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) from Torbra who pulled her body ashore.

As the crocodile swims back into the lake with her body, Torbra and Thanea do their best to destroy it, but aren't able to land a killing blow. It makes off for the depths, disappearing from sight.

Distraught by the death of their friend, the party regroups and works through their anguish. [Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md) expresses his regret at not being able to do anything to help, but Saoirse and Thanea reassure him that it is okay. Torbra finds [Wizira's Staff](../../items/wiziras-staff.md) on the shoreline, taking it to the party, clutching it like a sacred artifact.

### [PR36](../../sessions/PR36.md)

Returning to [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md), [Torbra Tauff](../../characters/torbra-tauff.md) breaks the news to [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) that [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) is dead and so they returned, defeated. Eventually Elysia gets the squad back to [Tenterfell House](../../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) for a debrief.

In it she chastises the squad for wasting their time with [Montel Leithran](../../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../../characters/esme-leithran.md) instead of completing their mission. She is remorseless that [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) died, noting that it is an occupational hazard of being [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

The party is able to provide Elysia with some useful information. They noted that the crater had filled with more water, was now home to a giant crocodile, and that before her death [Wizira](../../characters/wizira.md) had been casting Locate Object while thinking about [meteoric dust](../../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to locate the [meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). This pointed to the [Humar Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md) still being at the bottom of the lake.

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) speaks of their intention to go back to the crater after gaining backup. Elysia tells them that this early failure jeopardises their entire Meteoric operation. Even if not, it is possible they will not get to return.
