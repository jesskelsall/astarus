## Summary

Following the [Astornar](../../organisations/government/astornar.md) trial of [the firbolg controversy](the-firbolg-controversy.md), the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party must join a military organisation of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). They choose to join the [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md).

## History

### [PR20](../../sessions/PR20.md)

As part of the verdict of the [Astornar](../../organisations/government/astornar.md) trial of [the firbolg controversy](the-firbolg-controversy.md), [Corville Thornox](../../characters/corville-thornox.md) declares that the [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party must join a military organisation of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) following the absolution of their crimes.

After the trial, [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) is the first to make an offer to the party. They explain that they could join the [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) as a squad of four, would be able to work with [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) on issues relating to the meteoric threat, and that they would be paid for each mission they complete.

The party thanks them for their offer but declines to accept until they'd had time to consider all their options.

### [PR21](../../sessions/PR21.md)

The party chooses to accept [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md)'s offer of joining the [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md), meeting her in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/settlements/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

They begin a three week intensive training course led by [Ludolf Hornwallis](../../characters/ludolf-hornwallis.md). This is mostly academic study, cramming as much information about how to be an effective [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) into them as possible in such a short amount of time.

Following this the party begin their graduation.

They pledge themselves to insider [gods](../../gods/gods.md) in [Diamond Prime](../../places/buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md) before Ludolf takes them under the stronghold to the [Northhaven Astorrel Arena](../../places/buildings/government/northhaven-astorrel-arena.md). Joined here by [Levelle Tristwix](../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md), [Mergin Thorgus](../../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) and [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md), the party are told that they must demonstrate their combat capabilities against a pre-arranged challenge.

The party engages in combat with two tigers, a giant spider, and a giant scorpion. As they begin to fall it becomes apparent that they are polymorphed boulders controlled by the robed [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) also present in the room. During the fight two of the boulders are transformed back into a tiger and a giant spider, prolonging the fight. Ultimately the party makes short work of them, impressing the officers present.

With this, the graduation is ended when Levelle pins [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) badges on each party member. When they ask the party what their chosen squad name is, they name themselves [Starfall Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md).

When [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) is then promoted to [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) it becomes clear that she will be the party's superior officer when they return from the [Nature's Battle](../../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) tournament to start their [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) duties.
