## Summary

Tensions are rising between the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) due to their jurisdictions not overlapping, and differing philosophies on various aspects of society.

## History

### Campaigns Prelude

Over the past 3 years, tensions have been rising between the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). This has lead to bitter disagreements and in extremely rare instances, violence.

The [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) Court rules on matters where the two organisations can't come to an agreement, though this is usually reserved for serious cases that affect the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) fundamentally.

### [AA01](../sessions/AA01.md)

During the [Astorrel Graduation](astorrel-graduation.md), [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) gave a graduation speech that included a caution to all of the graduates. They should avoid conflict with the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and work peacefully and cooperatively alongside them. Levelle specifically said that tensions are rising.

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

While in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) tells the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party that they are annoyed at them because they have disrupted the very delicate relationship the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) have between each other at the moment.

### [PR19](../sessions/PR19.md)

[Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) provides the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party with [Northhaven Town Crier Script 312-5-06](../papers/letters/northhaven-town-crier-script-312-5-06.md), showing the party that [Itharmund Steeleye](../characters/itharmund-steeleye.md) is demanding the release of the party to the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) so they can pay for their crimes.

[Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) tells the party that [the firbolg controversy](the-firbolg-controversy.md) will go to trial in front of the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md), putting both organisations in direct conflict over the fate of firbolgs in the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md).
