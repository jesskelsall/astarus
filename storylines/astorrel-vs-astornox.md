## Summary

Tensions are rising between the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) due to their jurisdictions not overlapping, and differing philosophies on various aspects of society.

## History

### Campaigns Prelude

Over the past 3 years, tensions have been rising between the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). This has lead to bitter disagreements and in extremely rare instances, violence.

The [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) Court rules on matters where the two organisations can't come to an agreement, though this is usually reserved for serious cases that affect the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) fundamentally.

### [AA01](../sessions/AA01.md)

During the [Astorrel Graduation](astorrel-graduation.md), [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) gave a graduation speech that included a caution to all of the graduates. They should avoid conflict with the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and work peacefully and cooperatively alongside them. Levelle specifically said that tensions are rising.
