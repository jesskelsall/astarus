## History

### [PR37](../sessions/PR37.md)

Following the failure of [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s last mission and the death of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) is not able to offer a choice of mission, instead having agreed one with [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md) which she believes has the highest chance of success.

She repeats the mission briefing from the last time it was offered, pointing out the time limit and making it clear that they must return successfully in time or their meteoric studies under the Major of Phenomena may be shuttered entirely.

Elysia also mentions that there will be bounties available for returning a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), or captured [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), though she doesn't give specific values and laments that they won't be as high as she would have liked due to her poor bargaining position.

She tells the party that the mission will officially start in the morning.

## Planning

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) will be able to find the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) high up in a corner of [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). It will still be present inside a large crater, guarded by a sizeable amount of [meteoric watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md).

The main challenge will be an unforgiving environment filled with wolves and owlbears. [Meteoric watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) on patrol may intercept them before they find the crater.
