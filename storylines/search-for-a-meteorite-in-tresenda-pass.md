## History

### [PR37](../sessions/PR37.md)

Following the failure of [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s last mission and the death of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) is not able to offer a choice of mission, instead having agreed one with [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md) which she believes has the highest chance of success.

She repeats the mission briefing from the last time it was offered, pointing out the time limit and making it clear that they must return successfully in time or their meteoric studies under the Major of Phenomena may be shuttered entirely.

Elysia also mentions that there will be bounties available for returning a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), or captured [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), though she doesn't give specific values and laments that they won't be as high as she would have liked due to her poor bargaining position.

She tells the party that the mission will officially start in the morning.

*[End of session: day 0]*

### [PR39](../sessions/PR39.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) set off towards [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) on the morning of the first day of their mission. With [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s help they secure transport to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) by transporting goods by horse and cart (pears). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) has to put gold down to take the shipment, but she expects to break even once in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md).

With [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) at the reins and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) navigating, the party reach the junction of the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) and [Humar Cut](../places/roads/humar-cut.md) by nightfall, camping for the night in [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s Tiny Hut, a first for the party.

By morning they continue their journey, crossing the bridge over the [River Carn](../places/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) during the day.

*[End of session: day 2]*

### [PR40](../sessions/PR40.md)

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) continue towards [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) along the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md). Rain sets in as a thunderstorm rolls across the area, whipping up strong winds that blow a tree over on the road ahead.

While the party stop their cart and check for danger, three ogres charge down a side path towards them, engaging them in combat. A fourth is soon revealed. The party decisively kills the ogres in the middle of the rain and wind.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) heaves the tree from the road, allowing the party to continue along the road. The rain lets up that evening and by morning the weather is clear. By the afternoon of the next day they reach [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md).

The party drop off the cart of pears at the [Hyceodd Trade Post](../places/buildings/stables/hyceodd-trade-post.md) where [Upton McAran](../characters/upton-mcaran.md) pays [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) 45 gp for the cargo.

*[End of session: day 3]*

### [PR41](../sessions/PR41.md)

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) spend the afternoon in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), resting up before continuing their journey to the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). Here they again discuss the merits of proceeding directly to the pass or going via [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) to collect more information about it.

[Jonwen Cryss](../characters/jonwen-cryss.md) provides them a brief description of [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) as a quiet farming community, though is unable to provide them anything of use on the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) itself. The party remains undecided about their approach.

*[End of session: day 3]*

### [PR42](../sessions/PR42.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) departs [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) by coach for [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), taking [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md)' advise to search for information about the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) before traversing it. The following morning they arrive.

Their first order of business is to find [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md). Once inside they speak with [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md), an [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) with no practical experience of the pass. When [Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) and [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) come over to talk to the party they share some information about the pass. Weldira describes it as a valley with a stream running through of it, full of wolves at this time of year. She suggests killing them when Saoirse asks for a way to ward them off.

After Weldira and [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) leave, the party remain at [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) overnight, enjoying free drinks after Weldira overpaid. By morning they buy winter clothing from the market and size up the transport options. Finding nobody willing to take them through the pass by cart, they opt to travel by foot.

By the evening they reach the junction leading back to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) to the east, marking the southern entrance of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). They make camp for the night, failing to hear wolves deeper into the pass howling as the sun sets.

*[End of session: day 6]*

### [PR43](../sessions/PR43.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) camps at the south entrance to the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). Wolves can be heard during the night. By day they proceed through the valley, spotting dead deer but not realising what they are until [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) uses Radiant Soul to get a better view of their surroundings from high above. She notices blood on them from the wolves that killed them. While up there she can tell that the party are 1/4 of the way through the pass.

After an otherwise uneventful day of travel, the party camps for the night under [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s Tiny Hut. Both Thanea and [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) fail to notice a pack of wolves that take interest in the party's smell beyond the dome, lurking nearby through the night, waiting for daylight.

As the sun rises Torbra notices the 14 wolves and quietly wakes the group. They frantically prepare and plan for what to do next as the magical dome is due to end any second. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) shouts at the wolves in an attempt to scare them, instead provoking them as they move to encircle the dome. When Tiny Hut ends, the wolves dive into combat, but they are no match for the party. All of the wolves are killed.

After taking a short rest, the party continues north. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) relates the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) to the northeast to her dream ([Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)), telling the party that they appear to be heading in the right direction. As the trail moves to the eastern edge of the valley and then back west, Thanea suggests leaving the trail and searching the hills to the northeast, feeling confident that this is where her dream took place.

The party prepares to camp for the night before continuing further.

*[End of session: day 8]*

### [PR44](../sessions/PR44.md)

The party makes camp for the night, using [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s Tiny Hut for protection.

During the night [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is startled by a [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) scratching its blade arm against the dome, clearly aware of people within. As the rest of the party wake up they compare its appearance to [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), noticing a difference. It is also clear that it can sense their presence by sound, despite the dome being opaque. The hunter teleports away, not seen again that night.

On [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md)'s watch she sees a pair of glowing eyes in the distance from a [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), fixed in position. When she wakes the party they attempt to get a better view by throwing rocks under the effect of the Light cantrip at it, but can't throw them far enough. Everyone else goes back to sleep, clearly on edge but feeling safe within the dome.

The eyes disappear and reappear on the opposite side, prompting her to wake the party again. With nothing practical to do about them, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) return to bed, but [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) stays up as her worries are preventing her from sleeping.

Once again the eyes move, rapidly joined by more sets, until 60 sets of glowing eyes are staring back, the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) manipulating [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to get a reaction from the party. Torbra shouts everyone awake, bringing her terror to those sleeping. After panicked debate and battle preparations, [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) and Saoirse go back to sleep. The eyes remain for an hour until disappearing entirely an hour out from sunrise.

In first light of the morning the party fail to spot three [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) lying in wait. As the party begin to debate where they're investigating next within the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md), Tiny Hut ends and the hunters teleport into the midst of the party, blasting them with force magic.

The ensuing battle sees heavy hits endured by the party with little damage to counter it, a sense of desperation setting in. [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) shifts into her Swiftstride form for the first time. [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) makes an appearance using Dimension Door, coming to the party's aid.

*[End of session: day 9]*

### [PR45](../sessions/PR45.md)

Following their battle with three [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md), [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) discuss various topics with [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), including [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md). It is clear that she doesn't know anything about them, at first wondering if they are merely native creatures to this land.

As the party chat, in the nearby bowl valley of [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md), one of its northern cliff faces that connects it to the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) collapses. The [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md)'s efforts to consume all natural matter in the area and turn it into [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) causes part of the cliff face to give way, no longer strengthened by roots and dirt. This happens due to the loss of the [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md), the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) feeling it necessary to expand the area it has consumed to replenish its stock of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) for combat to come.

*[End of session: day 9]*

### [PR46](../sessions/PR46.md)

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) offers to scout ahead for signs of the crashing noise that [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) heard to their north east, explaining that she could transport herself and one other up to the top of the nearest hilltop. She picks [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) when no volunteer is forthcoming, casting Dimension Door.

From the top the pair see [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md), noting the brown grass where the slope from the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) valley floor crests at the edge of the bowl valley. Neither are able to tell that this is in fact a lack of grass, ripped away by the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) to convert into more [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) for its needs.

Back with the party, the pair convince the rest of [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) that they should head into [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md) and investigate. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) leads them up the hill, reaching its crest, a view of [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md) before them.

Here the party begin to notice the lack of wildlife or vegetation in the valley, Torbra noticing that the grass on the boundary appears to have been cut where [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) has ripped across it at speed to rip and consume it. The remains of trees and the lack of wildlife sound is unnerving.

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) casts Clairvoyance to get a better view into the valley, noticing the [Tresenda meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) crater. She relays this to the party, causing Torbra to begin running down into the valley, intent on reaching it quickly despite the distance. When Allisa spots a [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md), Saoirse tells Torbra to stop.

Torbra spots what appears to be the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md), which is actually the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) giving the appearance of what it thinks the party will respond best to, laying its trap. She also spots the [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) as it crosses in front of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), revealing its glowing purple eyes, staring right at her.

*[End of session: day 9]*

### [PR47](../sessions/PR47.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) shout at [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) to return to them, fearing danger from the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater seen in the bottom of the bowl shaped valley of [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md). After Torbra glances at the party she loses sight of the prowling [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) which teleports away into a hiding spot when it spotted an opening. Torbra runs back to the group, the party agreeing to retreat, rest, and formulate a strategy before returning.

At the crest of the hill they come across a large wolf ([Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md) in Wild Shape) which they initially fight, but [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) recognises it isn't hostile, appeasing it with food. The party find the wolf strange, following it when it takes a ration and leaves with it. It leads them to [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) who is on his deathbed, succumbing to his wounds.

They decide that trying to save his life and return him to civilisation is their top priority, but agree that they should try to retrieve the [Tresenda meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) before leaving, as the incoming winter snow will make the task impossible until spring.

The party begins to set up camp where they found Scratch, intent on sleeping there overnight.

*[End of session: day 9]*

## Planning

[Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) will be able to find the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) high up in a corner of [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). It will still be present inside a large crater, guarded by a sizeable amount of [meteoric watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md).

The main challenge will be an unforgiving environment filled with wolves and owlbears. [Meteoric watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) on patrol may intercept them before they find the crater.
