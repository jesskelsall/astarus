## History

### [PR37](../sessions/PR37.md)

Following the failure of [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s last mission and the death of [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) is not able to offer a choice of mission, instead having agreed one with [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md) which she believes has the highest chance of success.

She repeats the mission briefing from the last time it was offered, pointing out the time limit and making it clear that they must return successfully in time or their meteoric studies under the Major of Phenomena may be shuttered entirely.

Elysia also mentions that there will be bounties available for returning a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), or captured [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md), though she doesn't give specific values and laments that they won't be as high as she would have liked due to her poor bargaining position.

She tells the party that the mission will officially start in the morning.

### [PR39](../sessions/PR39.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) set off towards [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) on the morning of the first day of their mission. With [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s help they secure transport to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) by transporting goods by horse and cart (pears). [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) has to put gold down to take the shipment, but she expects to break even once in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md).

With [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) at the reins and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) navigating, the party reach the junction of the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) and [Humar Cut](../places/roads/humar-cut.md) by nightfall, camping for the night in [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s Tiny Hut, a first for the party.

By morning they continue their journey, crossing the bridge over the [River Carn](../places/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) during the day.

*[End of session: day 2]*

### [PR40](../sessions/PR40.md)

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) continue towards [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) along the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md). Rain sets in as a thunderstorm rolls across the area, whipping up strong winds that blow a tree over on the road ahead.

While the party stop their cart and check for danger, three ogres charge down a side path towards them, engaging them in combat. A fourth is soon revealed. The party decisively kills the ogres in the middle of the rain and wind.

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) heaves the tree from the road, allowing the party to continue along the road. The rain lets up that evening and by morning the weather is clear. By the afternoon of the next day they reach [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md).

The party drop off the cart of pears at the [Hyceodd Trade Post](../places/buildings/stables/hyceodd-trade-post.md) where [Upton McAran](../characters/upton-mcaran.md) pays [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) 45 gp for the cargo.

*[End of session: day 3]*

### [PR41](../sessions/PR41.md)

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) spend the afternoon in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), resting up before continuing their journey to the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). Here they again discuss the merits of proceeding directly to the pass or going via [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) to collect more information about it.

[Jonwen Cryss](../characters/jonwen-cryss.md) provides them a brief description of [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) as a quiet farming community, though is unable to provide them anything of use on the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) itself. The party remains undecided about their approach.

## Planning

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) will be able to find the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) high up in a corner of [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). It will still be present inside a large crater, guarded by a sizeable amount of [meteoric watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md).

The main challenge will be an unforgiving environment filled with wolves and owlbears. [Meteoric watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) on patrol may intercept them before they find the crater.
