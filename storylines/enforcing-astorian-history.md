## Summary

The [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) is built on a lie: [The Arrival](../history/events/the-third-coming.md) brought the first humanoid races to [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md). The [Astornos](../organisations/astornos.md) work diligently to enforce this origin story, particularly where elves are involved.

## History

### [AA11](../sessions/AA11.md)

When reporting a potential [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spy conspiracy to [Legacy Aranius](../characters/legacy-aranius.md) and [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md), [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) hear Legacy order [Tanin Arnous](../characters/tanin-arnous.md) to fetch a Truthseeker.

### [AA12](../sessions/AA12.md)

When [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) plus [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) exit the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers with [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md) as their prisoner, they emerge up the sewer ladder into the basement of an inn, passing through an Arcane Gate. Here they meet [Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md), calling herself "[Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md)" to protect her identity. She reveals that she is an [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) Truthseeker and the person that they are supposed to be delivering Xavier to, not [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md).

[Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) acts as a friend to the bewildered party who are extremely suspicious of her. After she asks them what happened in the sewers and what they know, to which they reply honestly, she asks them to set Xavier down against a large cask of ale so she can talk to him. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) is wary of [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md), warning her against killing him.

[Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) asks for Xavier's cooperation in [elvish](../languages/elvish.md) before casting Detect Thoughts on him, reading his thoughts and memories. Through this she learns of everything Xavier told [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) in the sewers, and his and [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)'s goals in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md).

She chastises the party for how much they know, calling it a complication, and referring to loose ends, before executing [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md) by casting Disintegrate on him. The mood in the room goes sombre and [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) drops her kind demeanour.

The party are threatened implicitly with the same fate if they don't cooperate. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) makes it clear that they will leave this place and never speak of what happened today, as if the events never happened. [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) makes it exceptionally clear that the presence of [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spies within the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) threatens the Astor-Syntenne War armistice agreement, and that what she is doing allows the continued peace & prosperity not possible while actively at war - particularly the [Blade's Rest](../festivals/blades-rest.md) festival currently taking place.

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and Korina reluctantly agree to her terms, leaving via another Arcane Gate. With the dramatic execution of their prisoner and nothing more to show for their day's effort, [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) give up the hunt for spies, going about the rest of their day. Korina goes back to her guard duty.
