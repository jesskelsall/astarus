## Summary

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) returns from a trip to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to her house ([Wizira's House](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/wiziras-house.md)) to find her father ([Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md)) missing. Where has he gone?

Having been captured by the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) for being a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), he is shipped to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) where he will be conscripted. It is up to the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party to stop this and return him home.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) Prelude

Nearly two days prior to the start of the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) campaign and the day after the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) crashed down near the town of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) returned home from  a bustling [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to find her father missing.

Their house's door had been kicked in and there were signs of a struggle, but no evidence of where her father was.

After searching their part of the Hawkwswood around their house, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) returned home and passed out from panic. Waking up the next day, she headed into [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to investigate further. Finding the town still busy, and unable to find Heather in her shop, she eventually took a seat in the shop's secret garden between the buildings, lamenting on the events of the past few days.

### [PR01](../sessions/PR01.md)

When Heather Pentz finds [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) in her secret garden, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) tells her of what happened. Unsure what she can do to help, Heather offers to search for any information she can, before giving [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) 1 gp to spend to take her mind off things.

Later, after meeting the rest of the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party in [The Slippery Weasel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) sees through [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s *Disguise Self* spell and blackmails her into helping him, or be reported to the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) for being a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md).

Wrenn suggests that he may be able to help her locate her father if she is cooperative.

### [PR04](../sessions/PR04.md)

When the party meet [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) at [Alistair Hawthorn's House](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/alistair-hawthorns-house.md) to accept his offer of [finding the Goldreach Meteorite](finding-the-goldreach-meteorite.md) for him, Wrenn reiterates his previous comment that he will help her find her father. He commits to finding out what he can about him while they are away.

Returning to [Heather & Horticulture](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/heather-and-horticulture.md) before leaving town on the search, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is told by Heather Pentz that there were [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) present in the forest on the day of his disappearance. She found this out through her contacts at the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) (she is a retired [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md)), though did so at great personal risk, and at her extreme discomfort. She is visibly shaken from the ordeal.

### Between Sessions

[Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md), fearing that [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) may have been captured by the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), goes to the [Goldreach Astornox Stronghold](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/goldreach-astornox-stronghold.md) to search for evidence to support his theory.

Before being caught, he finds records indicating that a firbolg was captured around the time that the meteor fell. He was shipped off for conscription on a cart headed for [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md).

### [PR09](../sessions/PR09.md)

After meeting [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) in [Heather & Horticulture](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/heather-and-horticulture.md)'s secret garden, Wrenn informs [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) the sad news that her father was captured by the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) on the day of his disappearance. Heather Pentz explains that he is a suspected [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), and is being shipped off to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) for conscription. He left on a cart with others yesterday.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) laments that if the cart reaches the gates of [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), her father will likely be lost to her forever. She encourages the party to travel to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), where serendipitously they are able to seek [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) at the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

They begin their efforts to leave [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) for [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md).

### [PR10](../sessions/PR10.md)

The party leaves [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) for [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), where [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) is being taken.

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

While seeking [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) talks to [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) about [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md), telling him that they were trying to save him from conscription by the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), and that they believe him to be on the way to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). Garrick agrees to pass on the word to someone who can help, though he expects that the [Astorrel Commandant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md) [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) will be coming to see them in good time anyway.

When [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) comes to visit, they ask why the party is here seeking [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) immediately tells them of [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) who was captured from their home outside of [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md). She impresses upon Levelle that he wouldn't have been taken willingly. [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) was able to find out that the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) had captured him as a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) and were taking him to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) for conscription.

Levelle and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) discuss the firbolg conspiracy. Levelle remarks that it is eye-opening talking to a firbolg affected by this controversy first-hand. They agree to look into the matter, remarking that they will meet again soon.
