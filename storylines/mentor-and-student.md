## Summary

When [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) accepts an invite to join [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md), [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) reluctantly becomes their mentor in the adventuring guild.

## History

### [MC01F](../sessions/MC01F.md)

When [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) accepts an offer to join [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md), they are introduced that same day to [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md), their mentor. Vētrall was informed by [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) that the adventuring guild had thought them experienced and respected enough to take a student under their wing, though they felt like a bad fit for the job.

Introduced by [Aneni Veomelo](../characters/aneni-veomelo.md), the Mother of the House provided them with a mission to kill a brown bear that had once again injured a miner in [Trubska](../places/villages/trubska.md). On completion Vētrall would receive a [Coin of Friendship](../items/coin-of-friendship.md) to give to another, and Valan would receive their [Coin of Family](../items/coin-of-family.md).

The pair agreed, heading to [Trubska](../places/villages/trubska.md). Along the way they sized each other up, noting their unusual racial characteristics. A surprise encounter with poisonous snakes on the road humbled Valan's combat abilities.

Once at [Trubska](../places/villages/trubska.md), Vētrall worked their charm and bardic talents to secure them free lodging for the night, much to Valan's discomfort and embarrassment. The following day they resumed their search.

Through an encounter with two axe beaks, Vētrall showed their true combat abilities, ruining both birds by casting Cloud of Daggers. This intimidated Valan who now knew his place.

The pair worked together to defeat the brown bear outside of its cave. Vētrall used their magic to disrupt the bear and keep it away from Valan, while Valan riddled it with arrows from his bow until it died.

The pair were paid 10 gp each for their efforts and secured 20 gp for [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md). With that they both earned their coins. Going forward it would be up to Vētrall to decide where they go and what they do.

### [MC02](../sessions/MC02.md)

On their first full day in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md), [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) orders [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) to find them adventuring work. Valan is unhappy at Vētrall, pointing out the hypocrisy of a lesson without supervision. Vētrall explains it away as their teaching style, not letting on to their need for some alone time to visit the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md).

### [MC04](../sessions/MC04.md)

Returning to [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) in [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md) after being teleported from [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) by [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md), [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) sleep for the night.

Vētrall wakes to the sight of [Nacnar Morwesyrr](../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md). They are exited to see her again, though Nacnar is remorseful at not being present when [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) died, and also missing his funeral.

Nacnar insists that Vētrall eats breakfast following their late wake up. She asks them about their new student, who Vētrall is dismissive of. Nacnar wishes to meet him, so Vētrall collects him from a conversation with [Eight Trees](../characters/eight-trees.md). Nacnar and Valan formally introduce themselves to each other.

When Nacnar asks of their adventures together so far, Vētrall insists they go somewhere more private to talk. Nacnar offers to take them to [Nacnar's House](../places/buildings/houses/nacnars-house.md), so the three leave [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) to cross [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md) to it.

### [MC05](../sessions/MC05.md)

[Nacnar Morwesyrr](../characters/nacnar-morwesyrr.md) leads [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) back to Raine's House where Vētrall can speak of the [memory sphere](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) in private. Here they confide in Nacnar everything that happened except for the specifics of [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s letter ([MC01F-L-3](../letters/MC01F-L-3.md)) and [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md)'s patronage.

Nacnar encourages Vētrall to do what they want with the situation presented to them, making it clear that they must make the decision for themself. Vētrall decides they'd like to finish what Geen started and honour their memory by solving the mystery he entrusted them with.

Nacnar calls Vētrall a mentor on several occasions. She regrets that she won't be able to assist them in their mission, stating that she's getting too old for adventuring and has business elsewhere, but won't elaborate as to what.

She gives Vētrall [Wither](../items/magic/wither.md), her old magical rapier that she used to carry around when Nacnar was Vētrall's mentor. She warns Vētrall of its double edged nature before suggesting that maybe they can teach their new student, [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md), a thing or two about sword fighting.

Nacnar sees the pair out of her house before parting ways with them.
