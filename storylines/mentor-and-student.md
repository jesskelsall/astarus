## History

### [MC01F](../sessions/completed/MC01F.md)

When [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) accepts an offer to join [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md), they are introduced that same day to [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md), their mentor. Vētrall was informed by [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md) that the adventuring guild had thought them experienced and respected enough to take a student under their wing, though they felt like a bad fit for the job.

Introduced by [Aneni Veomelo](../characters/aneni-veomelo.md), the Mother of the House provided them with a mission to kill a brown bear that had once again injured a miner in [Trubska](../places/villages/trubska.md). On completion Vētrall would receive a [Coin of Friendship](../items/coin-of-friendship.md) to give to another, and Valan would receive their [Coin of Family](../items/coin-of-family.md).

The pair agreed, heading to [Trubska](../places/villages/trubska.md). Along the way they sized each other up, noting their unusual racial characteristics. A surprise encounter with poisonous snakes on the road humbled Valan's combat abilities.

Once at [Trubska](../places/villages/trubska.md), Vētrall worked their charm and bardic talents to secure them free lodging for the night, much to Valan's discomfort and embarrassment. The following day they resumed their search.

Through an encounter with two axe beaks, Vētrall showed their true combat abilities, ruining both birds by casting Cloud of Daggers. This intimidated Valan who now knew his place.

The pair worked together to defeat the brown bear outside of its cave. Vētrall used their magic to disrupt the bear and keep it away from Valan, while Valan riddled it with arrows from his bow until it died.

The pair were paid 10 gp each for their efforts and secured 20 gp for [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md). With that they both earned their coins. Going forward it would be up to Vētrall to decide where they go and what they do.
