## Summary

[Astornox magicborn hunter](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md) [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) is killed by the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party as they defend themselves while seeking [sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md). Her partner [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) swears revenge at any cost.

## History

### Between Sessions

[Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) and [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) become aware of the party as words spreads from [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to Eaglesfield and then on to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) that a party of 4 potential [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) are on the run heading south.

They opt to stay in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) for the time being and potentially confront them if they are sighted closer to the city.

### [PR17](../sessions/PR17.md)

As the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) guard tower bells ring out in the middle of the night, [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) and [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) make their way to [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street in case there is a use for laying an ambush before the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md).

Hearing shouting coming from around [Astor Square](../places/structures/astor-square.md), Vilnia uses Major Illusion to construct a building facade in the middle of the street near to the stronghold's gatehouse. The pair stand in the street just beyond the illusion, waiting for trouble.

As the party rounds the corner, they step forward, ready to engage them. They intend to capture as many of them as can, hopefully all of them, as their position as [Astornox magicborn hunters](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md) demands. The more of them they capture, the more they get paid.

While the pair prepare to make their first moves, [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) shoots an arrow at Vilnia, enraging Kur. He retaliates by shooting a Lightning Bolt at Sparrow, knocking him unconscious.

As Vilnia's Suggestion spell fails to take hold on [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md), and Kur's Scorching Ray doesn't hit as many times as would be ideal, they collectively fail to subdue the party. The [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) who are still catching up aren't able to arrive in time to help them directly.

[Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) follows Sparrow's lead and knocks Vilnia unconscious with Magic Missile. When she comes to consciousness soon thereafter, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) puts her down a second time.

Kur falls victim to a combination of [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md)'s Magic Missile and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md)'s Ice Knife, both sniping at him from the rooftop opposite, as he had done to Sparrow moments before. He falls unconscious.

As he is being brought to consciousness by an [Astornox Guard Corporal](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-corporal.md), [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) succumbs to her wounds and dies in the street. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) fires an Eldritch Blast at Kur, knocking him unconscious again. He is once again brought to consciousness.

### Between Sessions

In the immediate aftermath of the fight, Kur does not remember waking up the first time. He does however remember seeing Vilnia go down at the hands of [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md). Finding her dead, his emotions quickly shift from shock and sorrow to blind rage. He swears to himself that he will kill [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) as revenge for taking his partner's life, no matter what it takes.

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

When [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) visits the party in [sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), they explain that due to the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) killed on their way through [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), if they were to leave the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), they would likely be killed.

This is in reference to [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md)' death specifically, though Levelle isn't aware of Kur's quest for revenge.

### [AA05](../sessions/AA05.md)

On return to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) from [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md), [Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) witness a stand-off between the [Astorrel guards](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) and a contingent of [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md). It appears they are here waiting for the release of some people (the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party) from [sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) sees [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) watching the stronghold gatehouse from a nearby rooftop, lying down and presuming he is hidden.

### [PR20](../sessions/PR20.md)

During the [Astornar](../organisations/government/astornar.md) trial of [the firbolg controversy](ended/the-firbolg-controversy.md), [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) was present. At various points he stared intently at the party, [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) in particular.

When it was his turn to give evidence, he spoke out of turn about the death of [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md) at the hands of the party, exploding into an angry rant before being cut off by [Patricia Wilbenotel](../characters/patricia-wilbenotel.md) casting Suggestion to make him stop and sit down.

### [AA06](../sessions/AA06.md)

On return to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) from [Astpost Northhaven](../places/buildings/shops/astpost-northhaven.md), the party once again notice an elevated [Astorrel guard](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) presence in and around the stronghold's gatehouse, though the [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) outside are no longer present. [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) spots [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) lying down on a nearby building. She decides to confront him, casting Misty Step to teleport up to him.

He immediately jumps to his feet and draws his blades, startled and threatened by her sudden presence. She asks what he's doing, to which he dismissively keeps telling her to go away as it's none of her business. When she presses, threatening to tell the [Astorrel guards](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) that he's up here, he produces his [Astornox Lieutenant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-lieutenant.md) badge. He explains that he's a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter, that there are four people in [sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in the stronghold right now, and that one of them killed his partner ([Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md)).

As Kur doesn't seem bothered by Ephaine's threats, she opts to leave him up there, teleporting back to the party and sharing her conversation with Kur. On their way back into the stronghold, Ephaine tells the [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) on duty about Kur. He is aware of Kur's presence but reassures Ephaine that he won't try to get any closer.

### [AA07](../sessions/AA07.md)

During [Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md)'s downtime [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) notices that the [Astorrel guard](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard.md) presence at the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) gatehouse remains high, though now without any associated [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) waiting outside. She notices a lack of [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) watching from a nearby rooftop.

### [AA08](../sessions/AA08.md)

When [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) meet inside the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md) during the [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md) opening meeting, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) tells [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) about having seen a blue tiefling ([Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md)) watching the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) from a nearby rooftop. [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) know who he is, telling [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) that they had a run-in with him and [Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md). They briefly debate who was at fault for their fight in [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md) Street before conversation moves on.

### [AA14](../sessions/AA14.md)

[Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) meet [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) and [Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) in [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md). Both have already agreed to help [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) on his quest for revenge against [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md). [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) hints at being a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) hunter, but nobody picks up on it.

### [PR39](../sessions/PR39.md)

As [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) exit the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) on their way to the stables, they are confronted by an irate [Kasdon Tinkermane](../characters/kasdon-tinkermane.md) and Candle in the Wind who keeps a stern watch over him.

Kasdon is immediately argumentative, expressing his disgust that people who killed [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) are allowed to join the military rather than being killed for their crimes. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) states that the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) made bad judgement calls, prompting [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) to try and shut her squad up before the situation escalates.

Candle comes down hard on Kasdon who looks to her to prevent him from doing something he'll come to regret. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) inflames tensions by teasing Kasdon, calling him a baby being taken care of by Candle, telling him to run along. Kasdon threateningly states his hope that the party doesn't return to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) soon. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) is aloof in saying that they'll go at their own pace.

As Kasdon walks off angrily with Candle in tow, he knocks out a citizen carrying planks of wood, demonstrating his monk-like martial prowess.

One of the guards that helps the citizen up expresses astonishment towards [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) that suggests [Astornox Magicborn Hunters](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md) can be unruly like this. When Thanea tries to relate with the party's experiences with hunters, the guard rudely tells her that "they know who they all are", clearly not holding them in high regard either.

The party briefly considers what riled Kasdon up before coming to the conclusion that they must be hated because they killed an [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) Hunter ([Vilnia Kovas](../characters/vilnia-kovas.md)) while infiltrating [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) in search of [sanctuary](../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md).

### [PR42](../sessions/PR42.md)

While in [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) enter [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md). Here they meet [Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) and [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md), both of whom have already agreed to help [Kur Merkys](../characters/kur-merkys.md) on his quest for revenge against them. Weldira is able to act cordial and doesn't let on, while [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md)'s quiet nature keeps his secrets.

The pair don't identify themselves as [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) Hunters for fear of how the party would react, though their [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) officer [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md) are seen clearly. It is only when the pair leave that [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md) says who they are.

When [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) learns that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) has died, [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) realises that he needs to inform Kur immediately, feeling that part of the risk of his plan for revenge has been removed. He leaves the building immediately without explanation or pleasantries, flustering Weldira who plays up her panic, trying to play [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md)'s behaviour off as socially inept. The pair leave separately but only minutes apart.
