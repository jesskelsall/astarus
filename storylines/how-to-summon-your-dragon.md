## Summary

[Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) wants to give [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) a [pseudodragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pseudodragon) companion, but first she must earn it.

## History

### [PR30](../sessions/PR30.md)

While unconscious following [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) casting Remove Curse on her, [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) hears the voice of [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md). She is happy that Saoirse is no longer cursed with [Meteoridis](../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md).

She tells Saoirse to go to the general store ([Ethel's Wares](../places/buildings/shops/ethels-wares.md)) near the southern gate on the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) as she has a gift for her.

### [PR31](../sessions/PR31.md)

That night, [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) searches for the general store by herself. She passes through the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) and with the assistance of an [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) there, is able to locate [Ethel's Wares](../places/buildings/shops/ethels-wares.md).

After a moment of browsing in which she bothers the only other patron currently in the store, Saoirse meets [Etheldreda Dowsing](../characters/etheldreda-dowsing.md), the store's owner. Initially they make small talk about her wares for sale, but once the patron leaves, she uses Prestidigitation to roll down the store's blinds. Her demeanour changes from a happy and semi-senile old woman to a sharp and discerning [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md).

[Ethel](../characters/etheldreda-dowsing.md) makes Saoirse aware that [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) made her aware that Saoirse would be coming, though the pair never acknowledge their shared patron directly. She explains that she has something for Saoirse, but first she must do something for her:

> You will have what you seek when you provide me something owned by few, coveted by many, and difficult to share.

Saoirse attempts to bypass the riddle, asking [Ethel](../characters/etheldreda-dowsing.md) to just tell her what she wants, but [Ethel](../characters/etheldreda-dowsing.md) refuses, enjoying making Saoirse squirm and curious to see what she will return with. Unable to make her budge, Saoirse leaves. [Ethel](../characters/etheldreda-dowsing.md) wishes her good luck.

Later on [the Maiden's Accompaniment](../places/ships/the-maidens-accompaniment.md), Saoirse presents captain [Dinua Costello](../characters/dinua-costello.md) with the riddle as a way of entertaining her. The pair and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) debate several answers, Dinua believing that Saoirse already knows the answer. Eventually Saoirse reveals that she doesn't, along with her belief that the correct answer is youth.

### [PR37](../sessions/PR37.md)

With her downtime in [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md), [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) convinces [Tydrus Tinshield](../characters/tydrus-tinshield.md) to let her run a riddle game in [the Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md). He allows her to place an advert outside on a chalkboard, advertising an 8 gp prize for anyone who can guess her riddle.

Initially this drums up little interest, but by afternoon Saoirse sees a steady stream of guessers. None of the guesses fully satisfy her, so she never gives the prize out. At the end of the day Tydrus asks her if the whole thing was a scam, but Saoirse tells him that nobody guessed correctly. Tydrus keeps Saoirse's 4 gp and his own 4 gp which he contributed.

Meeting back up with the rest of [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md), Saoirse runs the riddle by [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md), who answers that she is the thing the riddle speaks of. Saoirse finds her answer to be big headed.

The pair muse over whether "loyalty", one of the answers given at [the Rose Buckler](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-rose-buckler.md), might fit the riddle.
