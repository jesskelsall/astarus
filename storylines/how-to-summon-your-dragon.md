## Summary

[Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) wants to give [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) a [pseudodragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pseudodragon) companion, but first she must earn it.

## History

### [PR30](../sessions/PR30.md)

While unconscious following [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) casting Remove Curse on her, [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) hears the voice of [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md). She is happy that Saoirse is no longer cursed with [Meteoridis](../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md).

She tells Saoirse to go to the general store ([Ethel's Wares](../places/buildings/shops/ethels-wares.md)) near the southern gate on the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) as she has a gift for her.
