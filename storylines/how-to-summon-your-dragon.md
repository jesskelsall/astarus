## Summary

[Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) wants to give [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) a [pseudodragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pseudodragon) companion, but first she must earn it.

## History

### [PR30](../sessions/PR30.md)

While unconscious following [Mergin Thorgus](../characters/mergin-thorgus.md) casting Remove Curse on her, [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) hears the voice of [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md). She is happy that Saoirse is no longer cursed with [Meteoridis](../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md).

She tells Saoirse to go to the general store ([Ethel's Wares](../places/buildings/shops/ethels-wares.md)) near the southern gate on the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) as she has a gift for her.

### [PR31](../sessions/PR31.md)

That night, [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) searches for the general store by herself. She passes through the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) and with the assistance of an [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) there, is able to locate [Ethel's Wares](../places/buildings/shops/ethels-wares.md).

After a moment of browsing in which she bothers the only other patron currently in the store, Saoirse meets [Etheldreda Dowsing](../characters/etheldreda-dowsing.md), the store's owner. Initially they make small talk about her wares for sale, but once the patron leaves, she uses Prestidigitation to roll down the store's blinds. Her demeanour changes from a happy and semi-senile old woman to a sharp and discerning [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md).

Ethel makes Saoirse aware that [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md) made her aware that Saoirse would be coming, though the pair never acknowledge their shared patron directly. She explains that she has something for Saoirse, but first she must do something for her:

> You will have what you seek when you provide me something owned by few, coveted by many, and difficult to share.

Saoirse attempts to bypass the riddle, asking Ethel to just tell her what she wants, but Ethel refuses, enjoying making Saoirse squirm and curious to see what she will return with. Unable to make her budge, Saoirse leaves. Ethel wishes her good luck.

Later on [the Maiden's Accompaniment](../places/ships/the-maidens-accompaniment.md), Saoirse presents captain [Dinua Costello](../characters/dinua-costello.md) with the riddle as a way of entertaining her. The pair and [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) debate several answers, Dinua believing that Saoirse already knows the answer. Eventually Saoirse reveals that she doesn't, along with her belief that the correct answer is youth.
