## History

### [PR27](../sessions/PR27.md)

Following [the meteoric threat](the-meteoric-threat.md) briefing in [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) gives [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) their first [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission. She notes that this is a small mission to give them a feel for the process of completing missions, particularly for [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) who has just been promoted to [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md).

The party are told to speak with [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md), lead by [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md). They may be able to learn more information about their trip to Silethwaite due to their experience with the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). Elysia directs them to the [Sunrise District](../places/districts/sunrise-district.md) in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md).

With only the rest of the day to complete the mission in, the party leave [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) in search of [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md).
