## Summary

[The Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) were contracted by [Astral squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) to search for signs of a [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) impact in Silethwaite. They turned up little information. With [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s experience with the [Goldreach meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) wants the organisation questioned again.

## History

### [PR27](../sessions/PR27.md)

Following [the meteoric threat](the-meteoric-threat.md) briefing in [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) gives [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) their first [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission. She notes that this is a small mission to give them a feel for the process of completing missions, particularly for [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) who has just been promoted to [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md).

The party are told to speak with [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md), lead by [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md). They may be able to learn more information about their trip to Silethwaite due to their experience with the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md). Elysia directs them to the [Sunrise District](../places/districts/sunrise-district.md) in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md).

With only the rest of the day to complete the mission in, the party leave [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) in search of [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md).

### [PR28](../sessions/PR28.md)

The party make their way to the [Sunset District](../places/districts/sunset-district.md), finding [the Dog's Groke](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-dogs-groke.md) thanks to the help of commoners who point them in the right direction.

Seeing little through the window to suggest occupancy but hearing a faint voice from inside, the party knocks on the door. When nobody answers, they resolve to break in. [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) dives through a front window, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) climbs in after her, while [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) blow open a door round the back of the building.

Inside they face [Janneke Borflast](../characters/janneke-borflast.md) who comes downstairs with her bow drawn, furious at the break in. When Torbra tries to hide from her she puts tow arrows in her chest. When the rest of [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) emerges and tries to de-escalate the situation she surrenders.

Janneke attempts to hide the presence of [Kieran Bennington](../characters/kieran-bennington.md) and [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) upstairs, claiming to be here alone. Thanea subtly casts Detect Thoughts, quickly learning of their presence upstairs, while [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) sneaks upstairs.

[Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) and Saoirse discover the pair's presence upstairs, finding Slaine very ill in bed. Kieran initially won't let [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) near Slaine, who is not lucid. When he does show moments of clarity he is panicked, worrying about the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) he possesses.

The party learn that on their trip to Silethwaite they found the [Silethwaite Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/silethwaite-meteorite.md) in a clearing on the edge of the [Great Sile Woods](../places/forests/great-sile-woods.md). The clearing looked man-made. There was also a sense that something had lived there, but nothing recent. Slaine found and took the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). As the adventurers didn't know what it was, Janneke let him keep it, assuming he would sell it once home. Instead he became increasingly obsessed with it, eventually turning violent when people tries to take it from him.

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) manage to convince [the Morning Chasers](../organisations/the-morning-chasers.md) to let them help. They earn their trust by talking of their experiences of dealing with [meteoric watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) and the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), as well as being [magicborn on the run](ended/magicborn-on-the-run.md) from the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), which comes up when Kieran confides in them that he is a [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md).

When Kieran reveals that Slaine is physically stuck to the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) by the hand, the party feel it is essential that they separate him from it before it kills him. Kieran worries that any effort may kill him, but they are out of options.

Kieran volunteers to cast Dispel Magic on the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). When he does so it collapses into dust and transforms [Slaine Alabaster](../characters/slaine-alabaster.md) into a [Meteoric Humanoid](../creatures/meteoric-humanoid.md). It stands up and stabs down at Kieran with its newly formed blade arms.
