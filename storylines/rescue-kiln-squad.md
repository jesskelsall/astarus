## History

### [AA12](../sessions/completed/AA12.md)

After returning to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) gives [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md), now including [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) and lead by [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), their next mission. Following their exploits in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) ([Syntenne Spies in Eskrigg](ended/syntenne-spies-in-eskrigg.md)), which he does not know the details of, he explains that he is sending them on a mission far from [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) for their own good while the notoriety he perceives around them is high.

Bryce explains that their mission is to find [Kiln Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md), an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad who work for the Major of Phenomena ([Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md)) and were tasked with conducting wildlife research on the Neum Flats. They were last seen leaving [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) 50 days ago and are well overdue on their mission time. Their goal is to locate them and ideally bring them back to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) alive. Failing that, an understanding of their fate is desirable.

A rough description of the squad's members is provided by Bryce, read from a paper provided by their [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md), [Taza Finetrick](../characters/taza-finetrick.md). Bryce tells [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) that they can find Taza at [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) if they wish to learn more.

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) endeavours to set off for the Neum Flats immediately. Bryce agrees to start their mission timer the following morning, so the squad use the opportunity ot grab supplies and buy a wagon with two draft horses.

They leave [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) west along the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md). Late on their second day they find an overturned cart that was toppled by a griffon, still present and pinning down the couple riding in the cart. The party dismount and confront the griffon, fighting it and its two friends that appear when the first is provoked. Ahsha is able to rescue the couple from inside the collapsed cart.
