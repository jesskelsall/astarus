## History

### [AA12](../sessions/AA12.md)

After returning to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) gives [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md), now including [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) and lead by [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), their next mission. Following their exploits in [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) ([Syntenne Spies in Eskrigg](ended/syntenne-spies-in-eskrigg.md)), which he does not know the details of, he explains that he is sending them on a mission far from [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) for their own good while the notoriety he perceives around them is high.

Bryce explains that their mission is to find [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md), an [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad who work for the Major of Phenomena ([Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md)) and were tasked with conducting wildlife research on the Neum Flats. They were last seen leaving [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) 50 days ago and are well overdue on their mission time. Their goal is to locate them and ideally bring them back to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) alive. Failing that, an understanding of their fate is desirable.

A rough description of the squad's members is provided by Bryce, read from a paper provided by their [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md), [Taza Finetrick](../characters/taza-finetrick.md). Bryce tells [Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) that they can find Taza at [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) if they wish to learn more.

| Character | Pronouns | Race | Age / Height | Appearance | Class | Gear | Personality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) | he/him | Tabaxi | 35 / 6'4" | Sandy yellow fur, yellow eyes. | Fighter | Splint armour, two swords | Annoying trivia buff but very capable. |
| [Cherish Loweswater](../characters/cherish-loweswater.md) | she/her | Tiefling | 25 / 5'6" | Tanned skin, blue eyes, blonde hair. Ram's horns | Bard | Leathers, dagger, guitar. | Sweet and protective. |
| [Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md) | he/him | Halfling | 28 / 3'2" | Dark skin, brown eyes, short light brown hair. | Druid | Hemp dress, wooden staff. | Quiet and reserved. In animal form often. Deaf. |

[Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) endeavours to set off for the Neum Flats immediately. Bryce agrees to start their mission timer the following morning, so the squad use the opportunity ot grab supplies and buy a wagon with two draft horses.

They leave [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) west along the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md). Late on their second day they find an overturned cart that was toppled by a griffon, still present and pinning down the couple riding in the cart. The party dismount and confront the griffon, fighting it and its two friends that appear when the first is provoked. Ahsha is able to rescue the couple from inside the collapsed cart.

*[End of session: day 1]*

### [AA13](../sessions/AA13.md)

After helping [Ulfric Sander](../characters/ulfric-sander.md) and [Selene Sander](../characters/selene-sander.md) out after the griffon attack on their cart, [Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) continue west to [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), arriving after another night on the road. They stable their horses and wagon for the night and stay at [Two Anchors House](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/two-anchors-house.md).

In the morning [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) questions Ahsha's tactics, pointing out the lack of evidence that [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) even came this way as their last known whereabouts were [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md). They need to find clues to their whereabouts and use them to inform their onward search.

The party splits up to ask around in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md). [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) and Noon ask the stable keeper but learn nothing. Ahsha and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) ask the [Astornox Guard Sergeant](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard-sergeant.md) keeping watch over the [Hyceodd Astornox Stronghold](../places/strongholds/hyceodd-astornox-stronghold.md) gatehouse.

They learn that [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) passed through [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), helping the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) locate a building used by a local gang to imprison and torture immigrants living in or passing through [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), notably elves. Their [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) Squad Leader, [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md), declined to help apprehend the gang, insisting they had business to attend to that would take them through [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md).

Details of the gang were also learned: they may be part of or have ties to [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/criminals/the-crimson-blades.md), a notorious gang based out of Carnmere.

With two possible leads in other towns, Ahsha decides to head to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) and pursue [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md)'s next known whereabouts. [Canary Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) pack up and hit the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) heading south, turning off onto the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) roadway toward [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md).

That night the party camp on the roadside near the treeline. During Ephaine's watch she notices a gnoll watching the camp from the tree line. She wastes no time casting Hold Person and activating her Starry Form, allowing the gnoll and its incoming friends to be seen. The party springs into action.

During the ensuing fight Ephaine uses Starry Form: Archer and Guiding Bolt to blast the gnolls while [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) go toe-to-toe in martial combat. Korina in particular bears the brunt of the fight, three gnolls attacking her simultaneously.

After taking several arrows from the circling gnoll pack lord, [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) calls upon [Nills](../characters/nills.md) with Summon Shadowspawn. [Nills](../characters/nills.md) arrives with a frightening scream that terrifies most of the gnolls and [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md). [Nills](../characters/nills.md) helps to defeat the pack lord. The gnolls are wiped out.

*[End of session: day 3]*

### [AA14](../sessions/AA14.md)

[Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) reaches [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md). They inquire at [the Courteous Cow](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-courteous-cow.md) about [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md), but [Beludar Plowbreaker](../characters/beludar-plowbreaker.md) has no information for them, suggesting they visit the [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) for military specific queries.

The party make their way inside, greeted by [Reed Dovenby](../characters/reed-dovenby.md). [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) pushes through her kind hosting nature to get some answers quickly, asking her if she will check her records for the names of the [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) members. She is reluctant to divulge such information without good reason.

When [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) overhears [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md)'s name he says that he knows him. Ahsha encourages [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) and [Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) over to their table. The pair tell [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) that they encountered [Kiln squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) north of [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) some time ago, though they aren't sure when, hinting at their circular patrols in the area as [Astornox magicborn hunters](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md). [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) gives an accurate account of their movement north into the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) valley from the direction of [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), Scratch telling him that they were heading for the Neum Flats. [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) pointed him through [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) to get there.

When Ephaine gets bad vibes from [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) looking her over more often than the rest of the party, she forces [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) to leave in a hurry, attempting to give the sense that they weren't doing so by paying for two rooms for the night. They skip town to head north, [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) and Weldira seen outside [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) as they ride off north.

On the next day of travel the wagon is ambushed by two archers on horseback who attempt to kill them. The party is able to fend them off, though one of the archers kills the horse and unconscious archer still sat in the saddle, depriving the party of a precious riding horse as they flee. Shortly after they are blasted in half by [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)'s Guiding Bolt. The party recover their riding horse and continue north.

Entering the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) valley by sunset, Ephaine and [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) spot a dire wolf howling on a hilltop before 30 to 50 more can be heard replying from deeper into the valley ahead.

*[End of session: day 5]*

### [AA15](../sessions/AA15.md)

On the verge of entering the souther end of [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md), [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) opts to camp for the night before proceeding. During the night the sound of large quantities of wolves howling in the valley beyond alerts them to the dangers ahead.

The first day passes without incident, the party familiarising themselves with the geography and wildlife of the valley floor, following the trail. By night they camp at the base of an eastern hill, [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) arranging the wagon defensively with the camp and the horses behind it.

During the night a pack of wolves descends on the party, [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) not noticing them until it is too late. Before anyone has a chance to react, a draft horse and the newly acquired riding horse are savaged to death by the wolves. The party is able to scare off or kill the wolves using a variety of means.

With Ahsha tired from staying up for over a day, the decision is made to sleep by day and travel by night. The party camps for the entire following day, resuming their journey with their last draft horse as the sun sets.

The horse eventually tires, prompting the party to abandon the wagon. Ephaine loads up the horse with several bags of feed, leading it through the night as Ahsha tries to figure out the way forward. They camp again during the day, finding themselves further north as expected, but much further west than they realised.

The following night the party hears a pack of nearby wolves break into howls suddenly, the close proximity sounds of growling, snarling, and the death scream of a dire wolf killed by a [Meteoric Hunter](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md). It is becoming clear that there is a greater danger in the valley.

Another pack of wolves approaches the party, the sound growing closer. As [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) stands their ground and prepares for combat, the wolves pass by the party under the glow of a torch, running past them, seemingly uninterested. The party watches as two [Meteoric Hunters](../creatures/meteoric-hunter.md) chase down and kill several of the wolves. As the party attacks them, the hunters change their targets, intent on killing the party.

The party soon learns the creatures' abilities and resistances, putting up a good fight against their blades and teleporting. [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) uses her [Schiller Steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe to great effect, killing one of the hunters, turning it into a pile of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). The second flees before it can be killed.

*[End of session: day 7]*

### [AA16](../sessions/AA16.md)

[Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) beds down for the night at the northern extent of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). Wolves can be heard in the night to the far south, signalling that they have left their territory.

By morning the party makes their way through the narrow part of the valley to the north, eventually emerging to views of the [Albulain Valley](../places/plains-valleys/albulain-valley.md) before them, home to [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md), [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)'s home village. She leads the party to the [Seren Farmstead](../places/buildings/houses/seren-farmstead.md) over the next few hours, looking to return home at last and in search of somewhere for the party to stay overnight.

Here they meet the Seren family. [Schaef Seren](../characters/schaef-seren.md) is happy to see Ephaine and to meet the exceptional party members, particularly [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md). [Adalie Seren](../characters/adalie-seren.md) is happy to see her daughter again but angry that she has joined the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) and has brought other members of the military into her home. The party are treated to Ephaine's family's country hospitality over the afternoon and into the evening, being served dinner.

Ahsha asks Schaef if any other military personnel have passed through the area recently. He recalls the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) army heading south from Fort Maloja for the winter, and some [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) passing through before that. Ephaine asks if they passed through around a month and a half ago, Schaef suggesting that this matches his memory. He didn't meet them himself, but recalls them passing through the middle of the village, suggesting they asks someone there for more information.

As Schaef encourages Ephaine to visit the [Shrine to the Stars](../places/structures/shrine-to-the-stars.md) and the party do so after night falls, [Canary squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) enter the [Devdaha Crypt](../places/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md), keeping them away from their [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission for a time.

*[End of session: day 8]*

*[End of session: day 9]*

### [AA18](../sessions/AA18.md)

*[End of session: day 10]*

### [PR47](../sessions/PR47.md)

While [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) is retreating from [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md), they are confronted by a large white wolf at the crest of the hill leading back into the north of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md). [Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md), stuck in Wild Shape following the trauma of watching his wife [Cherish Loweswater](../characters/cherish-loweswater.md) die in front of him, catches up to the group he saw approaching the valley where [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md) were almost wiped out.

Initially he attacks the party, landing a large bite on [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md)'s shoulder and pushing her to the ground, but he remembers who he is and why he is here, relenting and backing up, dropping to his belly submissively. [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) picks up on his docile behaviour, offering him a ration which he eats. This de-escalates combat. Before this though, [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) lands a deep cutting halberd swing across his left shoulder, which is bleeding readily.

After a false start where Torbra tries to tie up the wolf, the party leave it to its devices as Elrick takes a second ration given by Torbra, intent on returning to [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) to feed him it. Realising that the party may be able to help, Elrick leads them out of [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md) and towards a small treeline on the northern extent of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) valley, where the [Foss Peaks](../places/mountains/foss-peaks.md) meet the valley floor. This depression is more overgrown than the surrounding plains and out of sight.

Here the wolf leads the party to an indent in a short cliff face where [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) lies, severely wounded. After placing the ration near him, Elrick allows [Luna](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to take a look within, spotting the seemingly dead body of a tabaxi. Torbra and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) get a better look, declaring him dead. Once his body is brought out from the indent, Allisa checks him over with her [Citrine Eye Necklace](../items/magic/citrine-eye-necklace.md). Finding life signs, she declares him alive.

The party do what they can to help Scratch. Torbra forces him to drink water, Saoirse pours grain alcohol across his face to sterilise it, Allisa casts Prayer of Healing to seal his head wounds. The wolf remains nearby, growling when Scratch is dropped while being moved, and otherwise lying on his stomach, Elrick desperate for someone else to have survived. At one point he places the ration on his upper chest.

[Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) consider de-prioritising their mission in order to get [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) back to civilisation to seek medical help, possibly heading south to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) or [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) and getting the message from there to [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) so more help can be brought. Allisa suggests that the three [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) should have enough healing magic to seal all of his wounds, so medical help need only be a warm bed and enough food for him to rest. She suggests taking him north to [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md), the closest settlement.

The party agrees to rest overnight, heal Scratch in the morning, then continue their mission before finding someone to help Scratch.

### [PR48](../sessions/PR48.md)

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) manages to get the dire wolf ([Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md)) to keep away from [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) for long enough for [Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) to ritual cast Tiny Hut so that he can be kept warm and safe overnight.

By morning both [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) and [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) use Healing Hands to provide him with more healing magic. This buys him more time and helps to seal some of his remaining open wounds.

The party departs for [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md) to find the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md), intent on returning to Scratch so that they can get him medical help. [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) pens a note with [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md)'s writing supplies. It explains that he is being looked after by [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) who will return soon.

### [PR49](../sessions/PR49.md)

After defeating the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md) in the [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md) [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater, [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) search for signs of life or loot.

[Lucia Velpione](../characters/lucia-velpione.md) finds a metal belt buckle and a Potion of Healing, both formerly belonging to [Cherish Loweswater](../characters/cherish-loweswater.md). [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) finds [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md)'s lost longsword, [Verlust](../items/magic/verlust.md). She quickly notes its fiery magic after swinging it.

### [PR50](../sessions/PR50.md)

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) continue searching the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater in [Upper Tresenda](../places/plains-valleys/upper-tresenda.md) for loot. [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) finds the breastplate of [Gillian Close](../characters/gillian-close.md)'s half-plate armour.

The party returns to [Scratch on Stone](../characters/scratch-on-stone.md) and the dire wolf ([Elrick Loweswater](../characters/elrick-loweswater.md)) in the cliffside inset at the northern edge of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) valley. The wolf is keeping him safe, and Scratch remains in bad condition. When he coughs awake, he is able to give his name and squad name - [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md).

Both the dire wolf and Scratch respond with non-specific sorrow when presented the breastplate, both recognising both who owned it and what it represents by itself. Scratch regains partial memories of [Kiln Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/kiln-squad.md)'s tragic battle against the [Meteoric Mind](../creatures/meteoric-mind.md).

Scratch keeps a tight grip on [Verlust](../items/magic/verlust.md), his sword that he lost in the crater. The dire wolf grabs it from [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) insistently and places it on Scratch's chest.

The party resolves to get Scratch medical help as a matter of urgency, deciding to head south to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md). [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) parts ways with the party, confident that they will meet again. By tying Scratch onto the back of the dire wolf, they are able to proceed south, the wolf happy to follow along, Elrick recognising the party as his best chance to help Scratch recover.

Over the next four days the party return south to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), clearing the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) without incident or snowfall. Along the way [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md)'s Healing Hands give them brief opportunities to talk to Scratch, though he remains pained when doing so and continues coughing profusely when exerting himself. They learn of [Cherish Loweswater](../characters/cherish-loweswater.md), the dire wolf's name is Elrick, and he is Cherish's husband. The party disagrees on what that means - Elrick is either a druid trapped in his wild shape, or Cherish is a druid who had a relationship with Elrick the dire wolf.

Arriving back at [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), the dire wolf quickly catches the attention of the [Astornox guards](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) on duty at the [Blittergate Astornox Stronghold](../places/strongholds/blittergate-astornox-stronghold.md). They are talked down from attacking the wolf before the party gets them to summon their medic, [Marlene Fresk](../characters/marlene-fresk.md). They proceed to [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) while awaiting assistance.

Marlene is shocked at the state of Scratch, dumbfounded that he is even alive. He orders Torbra to place him on a table inside while she and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) fetch medical supplies from [Fresk House](../places/buildings/houses/fresk-house.md).

Once back at the inn Marlene begins examining Scratch's wounds while using Thanea as an assistant. When she applies Keoghtom's Ointment to his face, he screams and attempts to stand up. Torbra fails to hold him down, causing Marlene to pin him against his open shoulder wounds while she continues treatment.
