## Summary

[Nilliski](../characters/nilliski.md) has a secret agenda that involves using [Nills](../characters/nills.md) to manipulate the [Schiller family](../organisations/schiller-family.md) into doing their bidding.

## History

### [AA10](../sessions/completed/AA10.md)

After [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) reads the letter given to him ([AA10-L-1](../letters/AA10-L-1.md)), [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears to nudge Noon towards claiming the [free Schiller steel](free-schiller-steel.md) weapon for one of his new [Astorrel squad hands](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md).

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Aww, I think he's the one that's soft! I was beginning to think that father didn't love you. I don't think you need his charity, do you [brother light](../characters/noon-schiller.md)? Though I'm not too sure about your new friends...

Noon hints to [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) that he may be able to procure a [Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) weapon, asking them what type of weapon they would like.

Later when Noon leads the party to [Schiller Steel Eskrigg](../places/buildings/shops/schiller-steel-eskrigg.md) and unsuccessfully tries to convince [Callum Briar](../characters/callum-briar.md) to let [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) have a [Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) greataxe for free, [Nills](../characters/nills.md) reappears to cryptically suggest showing the letter to him in order to prove that [Bernard Horace Schiller](../characters/bernard-horace-schiller.md) has authorised the free weapon.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Well, it's a shame, but the pen is mightier than the sword!

Noon doesn't pick up the meaning, instead opting to leave the shop for now.
