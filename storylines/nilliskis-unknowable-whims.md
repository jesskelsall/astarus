## Summary

[Nilliski](../characters/nilliski.md) has a secret agenda that involves using [Nills](../characters/nills.md) to manipulate the [Schiller family](../organisations/schiller-family.md) into doing their bidding.

## History

### [AA10](../sessions/AA10.md)

After [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) reads the letter given to him ([AA10-L-1](../letters/AA10-L-1.md)), [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears to nudge Noon towards claiming the [free Schiller steel](ended/free-schiller-steel.md) weapon for one of his new [Astorrel squad hands](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md).

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Aww, I think he's the one that's soft! I was beginning to think that father didn't love you. I don't think you need his charity, do you [brother light](../characters/noon-schiller.md)? Though I'm not too sure about your new friends...

Noon hints to [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) that he may be able to procure a [Schiller steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) weapon, asking them what type of weapon they would like.

Later when Noon leads the party to [Schiller Steel Eskrigg](../places/buildings/shops/schiller-steel-eskrigg.md) and unsuccessfully tries to convince [Callum Briar](../characters/callum-briar.md) to let [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) have a [Schiller steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe for free, [Nills](../characters/nills.md) reappears to cryptically suggest showing the letter to him in order to prove that [Bernard Horace Schiller](../characters/bernard-horace-schiller.md) has authorised the free weapon.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Well, it's a shame, but the pen is mightier than the sword!

Noon doesn't pick up the meaning, instead opting to leave the shop for now.

### [AA12](../sessions/AA12.md)

When [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) emerge from the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers and leave the custody of [Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) via a second Arcane Gate, they take a collective moment to decompress and consider what to do next.

While [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) is pacing, [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears, leaning against the wall. She is initially silent until Noon uses Awakened Mind to converse with her.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Any ideas [Sister Shadow](../characters/nills.md)?

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Well [Brother Light](../characters/noon-schiller.md), I think this one is even beyond me.

Noon audibly tuts out of frustrated dissatisfaction.

Later, after [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) returns to [Schiller Steel Eskrigg](../places/buildings/shops/schiller-steel-eskrigg.md) to retrieve the [Schiller Steel](../items/schiller-steel.md) greataxe for [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears to ponder the eventual fate of [Callum Briar](../characters/callum-briar.md), the shopkeeper who fears for his life:

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> [Brother light](../characters/noon-schiller.md), do you think father will take his life, or will he will do it to himself first? Place your bets!

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> To be honest dear sister, after today I neither know nor care.

[Nills](../characters/nills.md) chuckles.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Well answered.

### [AA13](../sessions/AA13.md)

When [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) recants her backstory and mentions not knowing what will await her in [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md), [Nills](../characters/nills.md) chimes in with a cryptic note for [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md), suggesting she knows what will be found there:

*[Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md):*
> ...so I'm not sure what's going to be waiting for me there.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md), appearing to [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) nearby:*
> What indeed.

During the night while Ephaine takes watch with Noon, [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears again, talking about Ephaine:

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> She's just a child. Don't let the badge fool you.  
> I think before long that part of her life will be behind her.

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> We shall see, dear sister.

While riding into the bottom of the [Tresenda Pass](../places/roads/tresenda-pass.md) valley, [Nills](../characters/nills.md) appears on the draft horse in front of Noon, speaking of destiny, alluding to [Nills](../characters/nills.md)' knowledge of what awaits the party in [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md):

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> [Brother light](../characters/noon-schiller.md), do you believe in destiny?

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I try my best not to.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> A fair answer. And what about this lot, what do you think?

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I hope they'll be fit for purpose.

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> For once I'm not speaking of us.  
> There's something out here in these mountains. I think it's only a matter of time until we find it.  
> Will you play your part?

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> Indeed dear sister.  
> Have I ever failed to in the past?

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Not yet brother, not yet.
