## Summary

[Tamman Seren](../characters/tamman-seren.md), [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md)'s older brother, left his [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md) home suddenly around 6 months after Ephaine left herself. His parents have no idea where he went or why exactly.

## History

### [AA14](../sessions/AA14.md)

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) encounters [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) in [Gate to the West](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/gate-to-the-west.md) in [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md). [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) recognises that he knows her name, seeing him glance at her and linger his gaze for longer than anyone else at the table. This freaks her out, causing her to encourage her squad out of the building. She covers her tracks by paying for two rooms for the night, but once outside tells the party that they must leave immediately.

Sensing her discomfort, [Bluefoot](../characters/bluefoot.md) and [Weldira Cobblecase](../characters/weldira-cobblecase.md) leave the inn, standing in the street as [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) take their horses and wagon north towards [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md).
