## History

### [PR27](../sessions/PR27.md)

Following the end of [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md), now a [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md), summons both of her squads to [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/tenterfell-house.md) - [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Astral Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md). Here she briefs them on their mission to understand and combat the meteoric threat.

While [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is providing a debrief on their time in [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md), she mistakenly suggests that one of the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) got away from them. This causes Elysia to send [Astral Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) back to [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) to search for it and make sure that no other meteoric evidence was missed.

Once the meeting is over, [Astral Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) led by [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) departs that same day.

## Planning

[Astral Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) will be back in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) when [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) next return. They will have slain the remaining [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) and returned with a bag of its dust.
