## Summary

Three [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) exist on [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md), the only ones to have existed on this world. Their destinies are intertwined, their paths are destined to cross.

- [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) (Scourge)
- [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) (Fallen)
- [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) (Protector)

## History

### Pre-campaign

Within the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) is a known [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md), a word invented to describe her. The republic know of no other [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md).

As a result she was prepared for a high government office within the republic. She refused the call, opting to join the Veritacris instead. Secretly she wished to search [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md) for another [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md). This has been her driving goal for over 100 years and has taken her through: the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md), the [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md), and finally the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md).

Learning of the significance of the [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) tournament, Allisa and her subordinates [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md) and [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md) plotted to move into [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) so they could watch the tournament, feeling it was a good chance to see exceptional individuals from Astor. They infiltrated [Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md)'s pit fighting ring, coercing him into helping them or lose his family.

Allisa's operating principles while in the Veritacris include:

- Not taking the lives of others, no matter the cost.
- Being honest about who they are. No false identities, and no lying.
- Avoiding detection by avoiding contact with others as much as possible.

### Between Sessions

After the [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) semi-final between [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Gloom squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md), word spread around [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) of "the angel" that took flight on radiant wings during the match - [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md).

When [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) learned of this and that their squad will be playing in the finals, she began putting into motion a plan to observe the final match from a vantage point inside the walls of the arena by using the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers for access.

### [PR25](../sessions/PR25.md)

On the night before the [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md) final, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) has a deva dream in which she sees her deva, [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md), once again offer her his hand. This is then mirrored when she sees [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) swoop down on Radiant Soul wings, surrounding her with them. When Thanea offers her hand to Saoirse and she touches it, both wake up in the middle of the night.

Thanea, not sharing the dream, finds it odd when Saoirse heads to the wash room at that exact moment. She confronts Saoirse there, both quickly learning that they woke up at the same time and have been having similar dreams of white-yellow glowing figures with wings who have been guiding them.

Saoirse also learns that Thanea sprouted Radiant Soul wings for the first time while she was unconscious in the tournament match against [Gloom Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md). She wishes she could have wings of her own. The pair agree to share information about any future deva dreams they have.

Saoirse's dreams of wings are almost immediately answered by her warlock patron, [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md). Effie bestows her with Necrotic Shroud wings, her magic further corrupting her [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) being. Saoirse is outraged at their lack of lift, not providing her the ability to fly. Effie is adamant that these are better, so Saoirse looks on the bright side and accepts the gift.

### [PR26](../sessions/PR26.md)

During the [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md) final, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) sees [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s Radiant Soul wings in person for the first time.

### [PR27](../sessions/PR27.md)

While high on [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) and slumped on an [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) street, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is noticed by [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) while on the run with [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md). She stops, feeling Saoirse's divine presence, though noticing it feels corrupted (her fallen [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) nature).

Allisa wants to help her, reaching out a hand to try and cast Remove Curse on her. Saoirse grabs her arm by the wrist, asking who she is. This spooks Allisa who remembers that she is in a hurry. Before running off she promises Saoirse that she will not forget her.

### [AA11](../sessions/AA11.md)

When [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) confront [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md) in the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers, he is willing to talk about what he, [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), and [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md) are doing in the sewers. He explains that they are here to see "the angel" ([Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)), who they learned of after she sprouted Radiant Soul wings in the [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md) semi-final. They wish to confirm her existence first-hand by watching the final from a spot under [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) accessible via the sewers.

The party is unimpressed by the answers given and are sceptical. They press for a reason - why they are interested in the first place. Xavier openly tells them that Allisa is an angel herself, the [elvish](../languages/elvish.md) word for which is [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md). He explains that she has searched every civilisation before coming to the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), spending over 100 years in the pursuit of finding another.

Despite the revelation, [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) isn't willing to look the other way, binding Xavier and preparing to take him back to [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) as proof of a spy conspiracy. During this he speaks [elvish](../languages/elvish.md) to Allisa who is disguised as a commoner on the other side of the sewer exit, telling her to leave him and go. She drops her disguise and attempts to grab Xavier while casting Dimension Door to make their escape. Unfortunately Ahsha prevents her from grabbing him, so she opts to leave without him.

### [AA12](../sessions/AA12.md)

When [Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) confronts [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) and [Yialdred Korina](../characters/yialdred-korina.md) in an inn cellar, she casts Detect Thoughts on their prisoner, [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md). Before doing so she speaks to him in [elvish](../languages/elvish.md), appealing for him to cooperate, which he does. This allows her to gain not only his thoughts but his memories as well. Doing so gives [Nia](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md) a full picture of his mission with [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), their goal (to see [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) first-hand), and her [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) heritage. This is the first insight into [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) that the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) have ever had.

[Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) also corroborate the information, giving an accurate account of what Xavier told them, even if they don't believe any/all of it.

Gwenhwyfar tidies up loose ends by executing Xavier by casting Disintegrate before threatening the party with a similar fate if they don't keep the events of that day ([Syntenne Spies in Eskrigg](ended/syntenne-spies-in-eskrigg.md)) a secret, pretending their day was a typical one instead.

### [PR34](../sessions/PR34.md)

After talking while walking across the Humar Estuary, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is able to summon for the first time her spectral wings using Necrotic Shroud. She wakes [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) up to show her.

The pair discuss how she was able to do it. Saoirse describes a radiant warmth in her chest that travels to her shoulder blades and into her skin, but as it goes it becomes a cold necrotic sensation. Thanea tells her that her own experiences of Radiant Soul feature the same warmth.

This confirms to the pair that they are of a similar kind.

### [AA14](../sessions/AA14.md)

While on the road between [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md) and [Filisur](../places/villages/filisur.md), [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) casts Scrying on [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), observing her location.

### [PR36](../sessions/PR36.md)

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) receives a letter ([PR36-L-3](../letters/PR36-L-3.md)) inviting her to an audience with [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md), General Supreme of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). It states that he wishes to discuss [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s performance in [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md), but this is a half-truth.

Thanea accidentally activates the letter, causing the magic within it to teleport her into the Tower of Ast.

### [PR36T](../sessions/PR36T.md)

[Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) meets with [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md) in [Supreme Hall](../places/buildings/supreme-hall.md). He is surprised to see her as she accepted the invite at the wrong time, but she nonetheless has an audience with him.

Having heard of Thanea's unique powers following [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md), and learning that [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) was specifically looking to see Thanea, through information gathered by [Gwenhwyfar Carew](../characters/gwenhwyfar-carew.md), Corville quizzes Thanea on her powers, going so far as to demand a demonstration of both her Radiant Soul wings and Healing Hands magic.

Corville sternly asks Thanea if she knows of [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md), or the Veritacris. Thanea hasn't heard any of these names before and says so. Corville asks if she has any relationship with the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), to which she explains she was found as a child near Bootle and seeking [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) was her first trip to a city.

Corville believes her, finding her confusion sincere and a relief, though he doesn't show it. He alludes to not knowing what Allisa would want with Thanea, but withholds his knowledge that Allisa believes Thanea is like herself.

### [PR37](../sessions/PR37.md)

*See: [Shared Deva Dream 1](../dreams/deva-shared-1.md)*

### [PR38](../sessions/PR38.md)

Immediately following their shared dream, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) discuss its contents.

The pair quickly realise that while their dreams started differently and feature their respective devas, they shared the part of the dream that took place at and around [Augury Rock](../places/structures/augury-rock.md), with them confirming that they saw each other.

They wonder about the third figure ([Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)). Saoirse initially dismissed her as just part of the dream, but Thanea draws comparisons between the pair and her, suggesting that she might be a real person experiencing the dream alongside them both, meaning that there may be a third [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) in the world somewhere. She goes on to lament at how hard it would be to find such a person if they do indeed exist.

The pair also wonder about their parents, as Saoirse doesn't know her father and Thanea was abandoned as a child before being taken in by her adoptive parents. Saoirse draws unsettling comparisons between her missing father and her male deva, wondering if they could be one in the same, but not liking the possibility as she is supposed to hate her father.

Thanea suggests that Saoirse could write to her mother to ask for details of her father. This could give them clues that might answer questions they both have about their parents.

## Planning

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) will use Message to communicate with [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md), scolding her for ruining her plans and putting [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) in great danger, now that the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) know that a Veritacris has interest in her.

This should lead to [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) sharing what they know with [Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and giving Thanea a chance to get in touch with Allisa. Otherwise the pair will likely not meet anytime soon.

Allisa will tell Thanea and [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) (who she half-recognises as similar but corrupted) about her lifelong search for another [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md), giving them the name of their lineage. She will relay dreams her deva has given her of a winged [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) and a dagger wielding [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) standing with their devas in a circle that includes her and her own deva.

Thanea and Saoirse will then begin experiencing this dream.

Allisa will try and get Thanea and Saoirse to join her at a spot in the Kas'ran Desert where she is able to communicate with her deva directly. It has been decades since she last visited. It will allow Thanea and Saoirse to do the same.
