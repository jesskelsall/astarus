## Summary

Three aasimar exist on [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md), the only ones to have existed on this world. Their destinies are intertwined, their paths are destined to cross.

- [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) (Scourge)
- [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) (Fallen)
- [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) (Protector)

## History

### [PR25](../sessions/PR25.md)

On the night before the [Nature's Battle 27](natures-battle-27.md) final, [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) has a deva dream in which she sees her deva, [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md), once again offer her his hand. This is then mirrored when she sees [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) swoop down on Radiant Soul wings, surrounding her with them. When Thanea offers her hand to Saoirse and she touches it, both wake up in the middle of the night.

Thanea, not sharing the dream, finds it odd when Saoirse heads to the wash room at that exact moment. She confronts Saoirse there, both quickly learning that they woke up at the same time and have been having similar dreams of white-yellow glowing figures with wings who have been guiding them.

Saoirse also learns that Thanea sprouted Radiant Soul wings for the first time while she was unconscious in the tournament match against [Gloom Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md). She wishes she could have wings of her own. The pair agree to share information about any future deva dreams they have.

Saoirse's dreams of wings are almost immediately answered by her warlock patron, [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md). Effie bestows her with Necrotic Shroud wings, her magic further corrupting her aasimar being. Saoirse is outraged at their lack of lift, not providing her the ability to fly. Effie is adamant that these are better, so Saoirse looks on the bright side and accepts the gift.

## Planning

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) will cross paths briefly with Saoirse while she is high on [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). Allisa will recognise her energy, but her need to flee the city will prevent her from saying or doing much. She will talk vaguely to her underling about how there is a second one though something feels off. Her underling will then encourage her to move quickly.

[Astorrel Agents](../campaigns/astorrel-agents.md) will face [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) in the sewers under [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), though she will keep her face obscured and only resort to her scourge aasimar powers if absolutely necessary. She will try to escape using Dimension Door.

Much further out, Allisa will get back in touch with Thanea and Saoirse, driven by her own deva / her parents [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) and [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md). She believes that the three need to be together for some reason, driven by her deva. Allisa will transport them to a place in the Kas'ran Desert where she is able to commune with her deva freely.
