## Summary

Three [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) exist on [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md), the only ones to have existed on this world. Their destinies are intertwined, their paths are destined to cross.

- [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) (Scourge)
- [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) (Fallen)
- [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) (Protector)

## History

### Pre-campaign

Within the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) is a known [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md), a word invented to describe her. The republic know of no other [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md).

As a result she was prepared for a high government office within the republic. She refused the call, opting to join the Veritacris instead. Secretly she wished to search [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md) for another [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md). This has been her driving goal for over 100 years and has taken her through: the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md), the [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md), and finally the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md).

Learning of the significance of the [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) tournament, Allisa and her subordinates [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md) and [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md) plotted to move into [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) so they could watch the tournament, feeling it was a good chance to see exceptional individuals from Astor. They infiltrated [Barthon Ironfist](../characters/barthon-ironfist.md)'s pit fighting ring, coercing him into helping them or lose his family.

Allisa's operating principles while in the Veritacris include:

- Not taking the lives of others, no matter the cost.
- Being honest about who they are. No false identities, and no lying.
- Avoiding detection by avoiding contact with others as much as possible.

### Between Sessions

After the [Nature's Battle](../mechanics/roleplay/natures-battle.md) semi-final between [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Gloom squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md), word spread around [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) of "the angel" that took flight on radiant wings during the match - [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md).

When [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) learned of this and that their squad will be playing in the finals, she began putting into motion a plan to observe the final match from a vantage point inside the walls of the arena by using the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers for access.

### [PR25](../sessions/PR25.md)

On the night before the [Nature's Battle 27](ended/natures-battle-27.md) final, [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) has a deva dream in which she sees her deva, [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md), once again offer her his hand. This is then mirrored when she sees [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) swoop down on Radiant Soul wings, surrounding her with them. When Thanea offers her hand to Saoirse and she touches it, both wake up in the middle of the night.

Thanea, not sharing the dream, finds it odd when Saoirse heads to the wash room at that exact moment. She confronts Saoirse there, both quickly learning that they woke up at the same time and have been having similar dreams of white-yellow glowing figures with wings who have been guiding them.

Saoirse also learns that Thanea sprouted Radiant Soul wings for the first time while she was unconscious in the tournament match against [Gloom Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/gloom-squad.md). She wishes she could have wings of her own. The pair agree to share information about any future deva dreams they have.

Saoirse's dreams of wings are almost immediately answered by her warlock patron, [Effie Silttooth](../characters/effie-silttooth.md). Effie bestows her with Necrotic Shroud wings, her magic further corrupting her [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) being. Saoirse is outraged at their lack of lift, not providing her the ability to fly. Effie is adamant that these are better, so Saoirse looks on the bright side and accepts the gift.

### [PR26](../sessions/PR26.md)

During the [Nature's Battle 27](ended/natures-battle-27.md) final, [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) sees [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)'s Radiant Soul wings in person for the first time.

### [PR27](../sessions/PR27.md)

While high on [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) and slumped on an [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) street, [Saoirse 贸 Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) is noticed by [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) while on the run with [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md). She stops, feeling Saoirse's divine presence, though noticing it feels corrupted (her fallen [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) nature).

Allisa wants to help her, reaching out a hand to try and cast Remove Curse on her. Saoirse grabs her arm by the wrist, asking who she is. This spooks Allisa who remembers that she is in a hurry. Before running off she promises Saoirse that she will not forget her.

### [AA11](../sessions/AA11.md)

When [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) confront [Xavier Raloven](../characters/xavier-raloven.md) in the [Eskrigg](../places/cities/eskrigg.md) sewers, he is willing to talk about what he, [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md), and [Castien Eladan](../characters/castien-eladan.md) are doing in the sewers. He explains that they are here to see "the angel" ([Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md)), who they learned of after she sprouted Radiant Soul wings in the [Nature's Battle 27](ended/natures-battle-27.md) semi-final. They wish to confirm her existence first-hand by watching the final from a spot under [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md) accessible via the sewers.

The party is unimpressed by the answers given and are sceptical. They press for a reason - why they are interested in the first place. Xavier openly tells them that Allisa is an angel herself, the elvish word for which is [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md). He explains that she has searched every civilisation before coming to the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), spending over 100 years in the pursuit of finding another.

Despite the revelation, [Canary squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) isn't willing to look the other way, binding Xavier and preparing to take him back to [Ronvyn Bafflegift](../characters/ronvyn-bafflegift.md) as proof of a spy conspiracy. During this he speaks elvish to Allisa who is disguised as a commoner on the other side of the sewer exit, telling her to leave him and go. She drops her disguise and attempts to grab Xavier while casting Dimension Door to make their escape. Unfortunately Ahsha prevents her from grabbing him, so she opts to leave without him.

## Planning

[Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) will cross paths briefly with Saoirse while she is high on [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). Allisa will recognise her energy, but her need to flee the city will prevent her from saying or doing much. She will talk vaguely to her underling about how there is a second one though something feels off. Her underling will then encourage her to move quickly.

[Astorrel Agents](../campaigns/astorrel-agents.md) will face [Allisa Balsatra](../characters/allisa-balsatra.md) in the sewers under [Vorrinel's Stand](../places/buildings/vorrinels-stand.md), though she will keep her face obscured and only resort to her scourge [aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md) powers if absolutely necessary. She will try to escape using Dimension Door.

Much further out, Allisa will get back in touch with Thanea and Saoirse, driven by her own deva / her parents [Mykiel](../characters/mykiel.md) and [Seraphina](../characters/seraphina.md). She believes that the three need to be together for some reason, driven by her deva. Allisa will transport them to a place in the Kas'ran Desert where she is able to commune with her deva freely.
