He leaves word that he will catch back up with the party on their way to [Hochwald](../places/settlements/cities/hochwald.md).

## History

### [MC06](../sessions/MC06.md)

While in [Golfmaul](../places/settlements/towns/golfmaul.md), the party see the day's news being plastered on the town's notice board. [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) reads it out to the group:

> The Alliance Senate meets to discuss the capture of [Côtedouce](../places/settlements/towns/cotedouce.md) by the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md).  
> [The Dragonbrand](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/the-dragonbrand.md) defied expectations when [Algar Stormrage](../characters/algar-stormrage.md), delegate for [Lelxuuth](../places/settlements/cities/lelxuuth.md), said enough was enough and swift action must be taken.  
> A vote is to be held next week.

[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) recognises Algar's name and realises that he is currently in [Arrepont](../places/settlements/cities/arrepont.md) attending the Alliance Senate. He sneaks away from the party to deal with his feelings privately, disappearing into a nearby alley. After a few minutes he returns to the party looking pensive, but refuses to explain why.

Arriving in [Sonnigeweide](../places/settlements/villages/sonnigeweide.md) and deciding to eat & drink in [the Nasty Huntress](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/the-nasty-huntress.md), Valan grabs a table ahead of everyone else, using the time to pen a letter ([L-MC-08](../letters/L-MC-08.md)) to Vētrall. In it he apologises for having to disappear but promises to return to them shortly. The letter is light on the specifics of where he is going or what he is doing.

Once everyone settles down to eat their lunch meal, Valan goes into the kitchen and hands the letter to [Askad Greybelt](../characters/askad-greybelt.md), asking her to hand it to "the blue one" after a few minutes. He then leaves while claiming to be going to the toilet.

After reading the letter, Vētrall chases after the sound of him running through the streets, but is unable to find him when he hides behind a front garden's bush. Vētrall goes back inside and bemoans Valan's disappearance, calling him a bad student. Both [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Nainarv Hardhelm](../characters/nainarv-hardhelm.md) break it down for them that Valan is an adult with a lot of past history that they need to be respectful of.
