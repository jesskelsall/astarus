## Summary

Learning that the party possesses a [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) that may contain a record of the Fall of Chausain, [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) strikes a deal to sponsor their search for answers.

## History

### [MC04](../sessions/MC04.md)

Following the party's defence of [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) at the hands of a [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) invasion from aboard the  Mistral, they relay what happened at the dock and the [Côtedouce Coastal Artillery](../places/structures/cotedouce-coastal-artillery.md) to [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md). Expressing regret at not trusting the party sooner in the wake of such death and violence, she is nonetheless thankful for their service and grants them her arch-mage's favour.

The party debates what to do with it, eventually settling on finding out more about [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md). Oriel inspects it closely, realising that it is an exception [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) due to its construction. When the party talks of their experiences fighting guards in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md), Oriel is taken aback by their description of the Fall of Chausain. She connects the dots, realising this [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) might be of that fateful evening.

Oriel tells the party that the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) can't know that they talked about the sphere if she lets them leave with it, saying it would cause a diplomatic incident. She offers the party a deal:

She will provide them with patronage, assisting them in finding out more about the sphere in exchange for their discretion on the matter. They will also return to her with any gained knowledge so she can "see it first hand".

The party agrees. [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) provides [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) with 20 pp, an amount she believes will help them with whatever their next step is. She is unable to provide them with any leads for finding out more about [memory spheres](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md), not being well versed in such matters.

Offering to provide accommodation to the party for the night and/or teleportation to any [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) capital city, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) expresses wish to return to [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md). Oriel realises that Vētrall is a [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) member, showing her [Coin of Friendship](../items/coins/coin-of-friendship.md) that she gained in her youth, explaining that she would be able to teleport the party to [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md) instead.

They agree, wishing to go immediately so they can rest overnight in [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md). Oriel wishes them well with blessings from [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md), before teleporting them to the [Trest Marketplace](../places/structures/trest-marketplace.md).
