## Summary

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is an Earth Genasi, somehow descended from Giants, a birth shrouded in mystery. As she grew up, she started to show signs of her earth elemental nature, and affinity for the giants' runic magic.

## History

### Before the Voices

#### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) Prelude

Torbra was abandoned as a baby in the Irewood on the opposite side of the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) from Iredale. Here she was found and adopted by her adoptive parents. Her real parents are unknown.

At the age of five her skin started to turn more grey, and rocky protrusions started to grow on her back. With nobody to help her understand these changes, she has set out into the world to learn more about who and what she is.

#### [PR01](../sessions/completed/PR01.md)

In [The Slippery Weasel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md) inn, Torbra tells [Alistair Hawthorn](../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md) that she is passing through town on her way to meet a wise sage. When [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) offers the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party work finding the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor for him, she asks for knowledge as payment - Wrenn will gain her access to a library in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) where she might research her skin pigmentation and rocky back.

#### [PR10](../sessions/completed/PR10.md)

When [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) asks Torbra if she is [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), Torbra answers that she's not sure what she is.

### Unintelligible Voices

### [PR11](../sessions/completed/PR11.md)

While everyone is chatting and eating during the rest stop on the way towards [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md), Torbra starts hearing voices in her right ear. They are low pitched and guttural, chanting in a language that she cannot comprehend.

The appearance of these voices cause her to look around for their source, but she finds nothing.

Not long after, while trying to climb into the back of the cart so the party can resume their journey, the voices start again. She freezes in place, both hands and one foot on the back of the cart. She attempts to rub the side of her head to make them stop, but they grow louder.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) notices that she has just frozen, and helps her up into the cart. Torbra sits down and stares off into space, holding her head on both sides and whispering to herself, muttering "stop it" repeatedly. When [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) asks her if she's alright, she openly admits that she is hearing voices.

As soon as the cart pulls away, the voices leave Torbra's head.

### Standing Stones 1

### [PR14](../sessions/completed/PR14.md)

While sleeping on the bank of the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), Torbra wakes during the night, once again hearing the voices. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) is on watch and follows her as she wanders off, confused at what is going on, unable to see and hear what Torbra is following.

Torbra sees a glow from over the next hill, and as she approaches the voices grow stronger. She finds 4 collapsed standing stones. As she touches them in the order she finds them, the voices cryptically tell her to seek our her giant lineage, and grow her runic power (Rune Knight).

| Stone | Rune | Torbra's Actions | Appearance | Voices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sunk into ground. | None | Touches it, tries to dig it up but it is deep set. | Large buried stone. | *Learn the ways of our people. Learn the ways of your people.* (repeated)
| Sunk into ground. | None | Touches it. | Large buried stone. | No change.
| Collapsed onto ground. | Stone Rune | Touches it. | Grey brown glow emanates as a crack shifts into a runic shape. Light surrounds her. | *Practice. Apply. Grow.* (repeating)
| Collapsed onto ground. | Frost Rune | Touches it. | Same as above, but sky blue glow. | *Embrace who you have always been. Go forth and seek.* (once, voices stop)

After the voices stop and the glowing auras subside, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) angrily asks what is going on, but Torbra isn't sure herself. She likens it to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) collapsing unconscious after touching the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md).

### [PR19](../sessions/completed/PR19.md)

While in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), Torbra is provided paper, ink, and a quill by [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md). She uses her time on [Rune Knight practice](../mechanics/roleplay/rune-knight-practice.md) for the Stone Rune, eventually succeeding in replicating it perfectly.

| Stone Rune DC | Roll | Success? |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 20 | 18 | No |
| 18 | 1 | No |
| 16 | 6 | No |
| 14 | 2 | No |
| 12 | 16 | Yes |

As the rune's magic takes hold of the paper, Torbra sees the rune's lines sink into the page, exposing an orange-brown glow from between the paper and the lines. Suddenly the anti-magic field present around [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) asserts itself, ending the visual effect, much to Torbra's frustration.

### [PR20](../sessions/completed/PR20.md)

During the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) trial of [the firbolg controversy](ended/the-firbolg-controversy.md), the party is asked point-blank if they are [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md). [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) replies that she isn't sure.

### [PR21](../sessions/completed/PR21.md)

Following the graduation combat challenge in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), Torbra gets angry at the boulders that rolled onto her when they transformed back from the beasts they were magically turned into.

Her anger manifested as Giant's Might, causing her to grow to 12ft tall. She picked up the last boulder to roll onto her, throwing it across the chamber, damaging the floor and wall it impacted.

Both Torbra and the rest of the party were surprised to see her sudden growth. After a few moments she comfortably returned to her normal size.

### [PR22](../sessions/completed/PR22.md)

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) uses her downtime in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) to research both grey humanoids (earth genasi) and runes, searching first in [Adventures for Adventurers](../places/buildings/shops/adventures-for-adventurers.md), then in [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md). She buys a book in the former ([Magicborn and Magical Phenomena](../items/books/magicborn-and-magical-phenomena.md)) before finding mention in [Humanoids and Rare Varieties](../items/books/humanoids-and-rare-varieties.md) of [Simanelli Tyrol](../characters/simanelli-tyrol.md) and the apocryphal story of his disappearance. This provides a likely example in history of another genasi, albeit a water genasi.

With the limited time she has left, Torbra uncovers no written mention of runes or glowing rocks.

### [PR25](../sessions/completed/PR25.md)

On the morning of the [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md) final Torbra spends some time shopping for writing materials so she can practice her Frost Rune. She tries 6 times, eventually succeeding.

| Frost Rune DC | Roll | Success? |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 20 | 18 | No |
| 18 | 16 | No |
| 16 | 7 | No |
| 14 | 2 | No |
| 12 | 8 | No |
| 10 | 13 | Yes |

### [PR32](../sessions/completed/PR32.md)

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) meet [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) at [Leithran Shack](../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md), spending the night in their company, learning of their lives and struggles as elves in the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). At no point during the evening does anyone notice that Esme is an earth genasi with skin colouration similar to [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md)'s. Esme takes a liking to Torbra, wishing to be like her following her use of Giant's Might to grow taller for her amusement.

At the end of Torbra's night watch she returns to the shack and overhears Esme murmuring in her sleep, repeating the same phrase periodically:

*[Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md):*
> Practice. Apply. Grow.

Torbra doesn't immediately recognise the significance of the words she heard when she found the standing stones near the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) on the party's way to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) from [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md). Nonetheless it plays on her mind all night, causing her to get no sleep.

In the clear morning light Torbra notices the colour of Esme's skin, doing an arm comparison. This catches the eye of Montel who comes to the same conclusion - that they are one in the same, causing Montel to get emotional. He has never seen nor heard of another earth genasi before.

He provides Torbra with the word "genasi", one that the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) use. He explains that while they don't understand the origin of genasi, they reverse them, celebrating their uniqueness, some considering them a gift from the [gods](../gods/gods.md) themselves. Montel has heard of fire and water genasi before, but until today his daughter was the only earth genasi he'd ever known.

Montel also explains that his wife and Esme's mother is of elven descent like him, drawing attention to Esme's elven ears. Torbra points out her human rounded ears, concluding that her and Esme are the same despite their other differences of lineage.

Torbra expressed her wish to see them relocated somewhere safe so that Esme could have a childhood. She offers Iredale, her home town, to Montel who appears to like Torbra's description of the place, it's people, and their tolerance for her during her upbringing there.

The party agrees to bring Montel and Esme with them while they complete their [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission. They will help guide them out of the Humar Estuary.

### [PR36](../sessions/completed/PR36.md)

At the start of her downtime in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) goes to [Hawk's Perch](../places/buildings/hawks-perch.md) to do further research. Now aware of the word "genasi" she searches for references to it.

She is drawn back to [Humanoids and Rare Varieties](../items/books/humanoids-and-rare-varieties.md), particularly the 5th volume. With the hour she has before the library closes she comes to the realisation that the story about [Simanelli Tyrol](../characters/simanelli-tyrol.md) heavily implies he was a water genasi.
