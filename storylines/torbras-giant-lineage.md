## Summary

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) is an Earth Genasi, somehow descended from Giants, a birth shrouded in mystery. As she grew up, she started to show signs of her earth elemental nature, and affinity for the giants' runic magic.

## History

### Before the Voices

#### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain.md) Prelude

Torbra was abandoned as a baby in the Irewood on the opposite side of the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) from Iredale. Here she was found and adopted by her adoptive parents. Her real parents are unknown.

At the age of five her skin started to turn more grey, and rocky protrusions started to grow on her back. With nobody to help her understand these changes, she has set out into the world to learn more about who and what she is.

#### [PR01](../sessions/PR01.md)

In [The Slippery Weasel](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/the-slippery-weasel.md) inn, Torbra tells [Alistair Hawthorn](../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md) that she is passing through town on her way to meet a wise sage. When [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) offers the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain.md) party work finding the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor for him, she asks for knowledge as payment - Wrenn will gain her access to a library in [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) where she might research her skin pigmentation and rocky back.

#### [PR10](../sessions/PR10.md)

When [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) asks Torbra if she is [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md), Torbra answers that she's not sure what she is.

### Unintelligible Voices

### [PR11](../sessions/PR11.md)

While everyone is chatting and eating during the rest stop on the way towards [Frizthwaite](../places/villages/frizthwaite.md), Torbra starts hearing voices in her right ear. They are low pitched and guttural, chanting in a language that she cannot comprehend.

The appearance of these voices cause her to look around for their source, but she finds nothing.

Not long after, while trying to climb into the back of the cart so the party can resume their journey, the voices start again. She freezes in place, both hands and one foot on the back of the cart. She attempts to rub the side of her head to make them stop, but they grow louder.

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) notices that she has just frozen, and helps her up into the cart. Torbra sits down and stares off into space, holding her head on both sides and whispering to herself, muttering "stop it" repeatedly. When [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) asks her if she's alright, she openly admits that she is hearing voices.

As soon as the cart pulls away, the voices leave Torbra's head.

### Standing Stones 1

### [PR14](../sessions/PR14.md)

While sleeping on the bank of the [River Humar](../places/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), Torbra wakes during the night, once again hearing the voices. [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) is on watch and follows her as she wanders off, confused at what is going on, unable to see and hear what Torbra is following.

Torbra sees a glow from over the next hill, and as she approaches the voices grow stronger. She finds 4 collapsed standing stones. As she touches them in the order she finds them, the voices cryptically tell her to seek our her giant lineage, and grow her runic power (Rune Knight).

| Stone | Rune | Torbra's Actions | Appearance | Voices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sunk into ground. | None | Touches it, tries to dig it up but it is deep set. | Large buried stone. | *Learn the ways of our people. Learn the ways of your people.* (repeated)
| Sunk into ground. | None | Touches it. | Large buried stone. | No change.
| Collapsed onto ground. | Stone Rune | Touches it. | Grey brown glow emanates as a crack shifts into a runic shape. Light surrounds her. | *Practice. Apply. Grow.* (repeating)
| Collapsed onto ground. | Frost Rune | Touches it. | Same as above, but sky blue glow. | *Embrace who you have always been. Go forth and seek.* (once, voices stop)

After the voices stop and the glowing auras subside, [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) angrily asks what is going on, but Torbra isn't sure herself. She likens it to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) collapsing unconscious after touching the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md).

### [PR19](../sessions/PR19.md)

While in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), Torbra is provided paper, ink, and a quill by [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md). She uses her time on [Rune Knight practice](../mechanics/roleplay/rune-knight-practice.md) for the Stone Rune, eventually succeeding in replicating it perfectly.

| Stone Rune DC | Roll | Success? |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 20 | 18 | No |
| 18 | 1 | No |
| 16 | 6 | No |
| 14 | 2 | No |
| 12 | 16 | Yes |

As the rune's magic takes hold of the paper, Torbra sees the rune's lines sink into the page, exposing an orange-brown glow from between the paper and the lines. Suddenly the anti-magic field present around [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) asserts itself, ending the visual effect, much to Torbra's frustration.

### [PR20](../sessions/PR20.md)

During the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) trial of [the firbolg controversy](the-firbolg-controversy.md), the party is asked point-blank if they are [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md). [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) replies that she isn't sure.

### [PR21](../sessions/PR21.md)

Following the graduation combat challenge in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), Torbra gets angry at the boulders that rolled onto her when they transformed back from the beasts they were magically turned into.

Her anger manifested as Giant's Might, causing her to grow to 12ft tall. She picked up the last boulder to roll onto her, throwing it across the chamber, damaging the floor and wall it impacted.

Both Torbra and the rest of the party were surprised to see her sudden growth. After a few moments she comfortably returned to her normal size.
