## Summary

While fighting the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) touches the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), infecting her mind and body with [Meteoridis](../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md). Compulsions and changes begin to stir within her.

## History

### [PR07](../sessions/PR07.md)

During the fight with the [Meteoric Watchers](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) in [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) throws her entire body on top of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) in an attempt to hide the purple glow which she believed may have been benefitting the watchers in the cave.

She immediately passed out on top of the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md). While unconscious, she dreamed of a evening's sky filled with stars, all beginning to move in tandem, shifting from white to purple as they accelerated. It felt good, and she wished to be back in the cave, close to the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) and the watchers. Here [Meteoridis](../mechanics/roleplay/meteoridis.md) compulsions began.

When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) wild shaped into a horse kicked the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) immediately woke up. She was able to rejoin the fight, but was compelled to grab the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) as she went.

### [PR08](../sessions/PR08.md)

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) allows [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) to look at the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) briefly. She keeps hold of it for the party, wrapping it in a cloth and attaching it to the side of her belt.

### [PR11](../sessions/PR11.md)

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) gives [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) the pouch of [Meteoric Dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) that she collected. When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) points out that [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) also has the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) in her possession, he insists on seeing it. She holds it out in the palm of her hand, but is reluctant to hand it over to Wrenn.

She insists that Wrenn gives her the pouch of dust back in exchange for the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), which he agrees to, but still she won't let it go easily. She demands a pinkie promise from Wrenn in order to part with it, and only if he will return it to her once he's done looking.

He complies. After looking at the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor, he hands it back to [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) for safe keeping.

This is a clear manifestation of her compulsion to stay near to [Meteoric Dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md).

### [PR19](../sessions/PR19.md)

While in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), Torbra questions Saoirse directly about why she carries the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor around everywhere she goes. She explains that she wants to protect it and probably likes it more than the rest of the party. Thanea defends her, noting that [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) considers the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) and pouch of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to be important.

When [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) visits a second time she sees Saoirse in the bathroom clutching the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md), refusing to leave. When Elysia leaves she gives Saoirse a perplexed look.

### [PR20](../sessions/PR20.md)

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) learns that there is something magical about the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), but the anti-magic field present inside [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) makes it impossible for her to learn any more than that.

### [PR22](../sessions/PR22.md)

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md), now out of the anti-magic field of [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), decides to experiment with the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) and the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) she has collected. She finds that ingesting some of the dust will enhance her magical abilities, but it also has psychedelic effects.

*[[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) learns how to ingest [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) to induce the [meteoric dust effect](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust-effect.md).]*

### [PR25](../sessions/PR25.md)

Hours before the [Nature's Battle 27](natures-battle-27.md) final, [Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) ingests a portion of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md). She does so because she feels useless in the arena, so she may as well fight while high.

### [PR26](../sessions/PR26.md)

[Saoirse ó Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) fights in the [Nature's Battle 27](natures-battle-27.md) final while under the effect of the [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md) she ingested. She casts Meteoric Blast for the first time. Following [Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s defeat, during which she was knocked unconscious, she is revived by an [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md). Startled and still freaking out due to the dust's effects, she runs out of the arena.
