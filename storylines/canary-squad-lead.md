## Summary

The newly formed [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md), made up of the [Astorrel Agents](../campaigns/C2-astorrel-agents.md) party, needs an [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md). [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) must decide who is best suited for the promotion.

## Mission

## History

### [AA01](../sessions/AA01.md)

When the party met their new superior officer, [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) placed them in a squad together which they eventually named [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md).

He explained to them that he would be picking one of them to be promoted from [Astorrel Squad Hand](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md) to [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md). This would have the following perks:

- Increased mission bounty compared to the rest of the squad.
- The success or failure of the mission is more on their shoulders.
- Opportunities for further promotion.

Until he has made his decision, Bryce will be making one squad member per mission "acting Squad Lead" so that they may prove themselves.

### [AA02](../sessions/AA02.md)

[Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) gives both of his squads their first missions and names the first acting squad leads, picking both Ahsha and Darius for having received the Exceptional Trainee Bonus.

| Squad | Acting Lead | Mission | Bounty | Time Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | ---:| --- |
| [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) | [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) | Investigate Bear Attacks in Hartsgarth | 30 gp | 10 days |
| [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) | [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) | [Check Logging in Arnaside](ended/check-logging-in-arnaside.md) | 20 gp | 14 days |

The party begins their journey to [Arnaside](../places/villages/arnaside.md) so that they can complete their mission in good time and return as soon as possible. Ahsha takes charge of deciding how the group will get there (hired coach), and converses with [Clay Mullen](../characters/clay-mullen.md) to hire his services to this end.

### [AA06](../sessions/AA06.md)

Their downtime after their first mission over, [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) returns to [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) to start their next mission. He picks [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) as the next acting [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md), explaining that this mission is best suited to their skills.

With the squad invited to compete in [Nature's Battle 27](ended/natures-battle-27.md), Bryce makes it clear that the tournament takes priority, so the squad can pick at the mission beforehand and finish it after. They opt to wait until after the tournament.

| Squad | Acting Lead | Mission | Bounty | Time Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | ---:| --- |
| [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) | [Whisper on the Breeze](../characters/whisper-on-the-breeze.md) | Independent Investigation of [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md) | 25 gp | *Flexible* |
