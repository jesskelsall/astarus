## Summary

[Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) investigate what is going on in [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md) between the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) in regards to the village's expansion. [Kasston Tosslefront](../characters/kasston-tosslefront.md), [Astorrel Major](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-major.md) of Urban Expansion has commissioned an independent report in order to make sure [Goshawk Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) and [Spoor Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/spoor-squad.md) are not causing issues.

## History

### [AA06](../sessions/AA06.md)

With their downtime over, [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) reports back to [Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) to receive their next mission. He introduces their mission to [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md), explaining that [Kasston Tosslefront](../characters/kasston-tosslefront.md) wants an independent eye cast on both the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) in [Ulburn](../places/villages/ulburn.md) to ensure that tensions between the two organisations aren't being exacerbated.

With the squad also receiving the [Nature's Battle Canary Squad Invite](../papers/letters/natures-battle-canary-squad-invite.md), Bryce makes it clear that the [Nature's Battle 27](natures-battle-27.md) is their priority if they wish to participate. The mission doesn't have a strict deadline, so they could start prior to the tournament and then finish up after.

[Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) tells Bryce they intend to accept the invite, after which they respond to the letter. They opt not to start on the mission until the tournament is over.
