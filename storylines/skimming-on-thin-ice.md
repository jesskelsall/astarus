## Summary

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) were tasked by [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) to retrieve the contents of [the Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s strongbox from the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md). After disappearing from [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) they must prove to the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) that they are still attempting to complete their mission.

## History

### [MC03](../sessions/completed/MC03.md)

Immediately after escaping the [Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) jail in [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md), [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) pulls the party into a building to speak with them, hiding them from the guards in the process.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) reveals himself as a member of the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md), and knows exactly who [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) are. He tells them they are in deep trouble for abandoning their mission in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md), the organisation believing their disappearance was organised.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) makes it clear that they have 5,000 gp bounties on each of their heads within the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md), though he can help clear their names if they are seen to be making their way back to [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) to complete their mission of returning to her with the contents of [the Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s strongbox within the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md).

When it is revealed that [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) didn't receive [Unevaire](../items/weapons/unevaire.md) in the vaults but the [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md), Kera and Marik are distraught, but [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) assures them that the sword was the best case scenario, going so far as to postulate that [Creek](../characters/creek.md) and [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) weren't expecting what Vētrall found either.

After [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) reveals that he orchestrated their escape from jail, he makes his intentions clear. He has no interest in seeing the [memory sphere](../items/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) in the hands of [Creek](../characters/creek.md) and [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md), having bad blood with both, but Kera and Marik must at least be seen trying to complete their mission. It is clear to everyone that [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) is taking a great risk to allow them to proceed.

Kera and Marik reluctantly agree to head back to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) in good time. They begin helping the arch-mage with a possible [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) invasion attempt as a means to secure transport out of [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md).
