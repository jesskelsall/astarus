## Summary

[Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) were tasked by [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) to retrieve the contents of [the Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s strongbox from the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md). After disappearing from [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) they must prove to the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) that they are still attempting to complete their mission.

## History

### [MC03](../sessions/MC03.md)

Immediately after escaping the [Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) jail in [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md), [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) pulls the party into a building to speak with them, hiding them from the guards in the process.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) reveals himself as a member of the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md), and knows exactly who [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) are. He tells them they are in deep trouble for abandoning their mission in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md), the organisation believing their disappearance was organised.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) makes it clear that they have 5,000 gp bounties on each of their heads within the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md), though he can help clear their names if they are seen to be making their way back to [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) in [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) to complete their mission of returning to her with the contents of [the Metal Fox](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s strongbox within the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md).

When it is revealed that [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) didn't receive [Unevaire](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/weapons/unevaire.md) in the vaults but the [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md), Kera and Marik are distraught, but [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) assures them that the sword was the best case scenario, going so far as to postulate that [Creek](../characters/creek.md) and [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) weren't expecting what Vētrall found either.

After [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) reveals that he orchestrated their escape from jail, he makes his intentions clear. He has no interest in seeing the [memory sphere](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) in the hands of [Creek](../characters/creek.md) and [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md), having bad blood with both, but Kera and Marik must at least be seen trying to complete their mission. It is clear to everyone that [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) is taking a great risk to allow them to proceed.

Kera and Marik reluctantly agree to head back to [Starnov](../places/cities/starnov.md) in good time. They begin helping the arch-mage with a possible [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) invasion attempt as a means to secure transport out of [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md).

### [MC04](../sessions/MC04.md)

After being teleported from [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) to [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md) by [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md), [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) stay overnight in [Nomad's Stop](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/nomads-stop.md) while [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) return to [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md).

Rather than going straight to bed, the pair have a night cap and quietly discuss their next move. They consider how they will complete their mission for [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md), weighing up whether they should just steal the [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/artifacts-of-oonar/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md) from Vētrall and do as their mission demands, or try to complete the mission some other way. They note that [Crucible](../characters/crucible.md) likely doesn't know what [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md) had stored in the [Nilus Vaults](../places/buildings/government/nilus-vaults.md), so they could return with anything interesting and pass it off as the treasure.

They also speak of their disdain for [Creek](../characters/creek.md) and their debt to him. Kera expresses a wish to return to [Kuv'narash](../places/villages/kuvnarash.md) to "rake sand" while Marik dreams of a solitary life in the mountains.

No concrete plans are made that evening.

### [MC05](../sessions/MC05.md)

With a bounty still on their heads, [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) and [Marik Kaligavone](../characters/marik-kaligavone.md) are lead into a trap by [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) who brings them to [Viola](../characters/viola.md). Both are also [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md). In a courtyard down a back alley they are ambushed, the pair intent on claiming their bounty, declaring it "nothing personal".

Kera quickly dispatches [Cork Pop](../characters/cork-pop.md) before the pair threaten to end her life if [Viola](../characters/viola.md) doesn't give up. [Viola](../characters/viola.md) drops her mace and begs for them to save the kenku. Unfortunately Kera's attack while she was downed put her perilously close to death and she expired.

When Marik suggests they kill [Viola](../characters/viola.md), she darts for the gate, attempting to flee. Marik and Kera slash and burn at her with greatsword and Produce Flame respectively before Kera lands a finishing blow with his horns. He stabs [Viola](../characters/viola.md) multiple times to finish the act. The pair hide the bodies and proceed to return to their inn nonchalantly.

Now aware that their bounty has invited much danger to them, they opt not to seek [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) in [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md) while looking to purchase thieves' tools.
