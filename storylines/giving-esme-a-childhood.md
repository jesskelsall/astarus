## Summary

[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) is running from [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) with his daughter [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md), trying to find her a safe home to grow up in.

## History

### [PR32](../sessions/completed/PR32.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) come across [Leithran Shack](../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md) on the Humar Estuary. They hear a male voice ([Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md)) calling for help. After some conversation at distance they learn that the person needs help defending against crocodiles. Initially wary of a trap, the party decide to rush to help.

As they arrive, Montel is bitten by a crocodile and knocked unconscious. The party manage to fend off a collection of crocodiles that were lurking in the surrounding waters, including the one that attacked Montel. As the fight progresses, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) manages to pull him back from the brink of death by casting Healing Word.

With the fight winding down, Montel leaps to his feet and rushes into the shack, shouting about his daughter [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md):

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> My girl! My girl!
