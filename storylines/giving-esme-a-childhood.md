## Summary

[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) is running from [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md) with his daughter [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md), trying to find her a safe home to grow up in.

## History

### [PR32](../sessions/completed/PR32.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) come across [Leithran Shack](../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md) on the Humar Estuary. They hear a male voice ([Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md)) calling for help. After some conversation at distance they learn that the person needs help defending against crocodiles. Initially wary of a trap, the party decide to rush to help.

As they arrive, Montel is bitten by a crocodile and knocked unconscious. The party manage to fend off a collection of crocodiles that were lurking in the surrounding waters, including the one that attacked Montel. As the fight progresses, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) manages to pull him back from the brink of death by casting Healing Word.

With the fight winding down, Montel leaps to his feet and rushes into the shack, shouting about his daughter [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md):

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> My girl! My girl!

### [PR33](../sessions/completed/PR33.md)

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) goes into [Leithran Shack](../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md) after [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md), finding him consoling his daughter [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md). It becomes clear that they are both elves. In the pair she and the party find a loving father who is taking care of his four year old daughter as they search for a new home.

The party learn that the Montel and his wife [Vensys Leithran](../characters/vensys-leithran.md) were originally from the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), fleeing after a family disagreement. They emigrated to the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) via Mossband, [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), and then [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), where they lived for four years, Vensys giving birth to Esme not long after they arrived.

Through context clues the party piece together that Vensys died in [Hyceodd](../places/towns/hyceodd.md), causing Montel and Esme to flee. They are now searching for a new home in [Kardanis](../places/regions/kardanis.md) or the [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md), but Montel doesn't really have a plan. They ended up on the Humar Estuary and have been staying in this shack for several days, looking to avoid the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) above all else.

In the morning when Torbra learns that Esme is an earth genasi like her, her desire to see them reach safety grows. Torbra tells of Iredale where Torbra grew up and their acceptance of her, despite her being different. Montel feels that the town could be a good place to try despite it having no elves.

The party agree to bring Montel and Esme with them as they continue their mission, intent on at least getting them off of the estuary after they find what they are looking for.
