## Summary

[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) is running from [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md) with his daughter [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md), trying to find her a safe home to grow up in.

## History

### [PR32](../sessions/PR32.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) come across [Leithran Shack](../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md) on the [Humar Estuary](../places/topography/swamps-deltas/humar-estuary.md). They hear a male voice ([Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md)) calling for help. After some conversation at distance they learn that the person needs help defending against crocodiles. Initially wary of a trap, the party decide to rush to help.

As they arrive, Montel is bitten by a crocodile and knocked unconscious. The party manage to fend off a collection of crocodiles that were lurking in the surrounding waters, including the one that attacked Montel. As the fight progresses, [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) manages to pull him back from the brink of death by casting Healing Word.

With the fight winding down, Montel leaps to his feet and rushes into the shack, shouting about his daughter [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md):

*[Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md):*
> My girl! My girl!

### [PR33](../sessions/PR33.md)

[Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) goes into [Leithran Shack](../places/buildings/leithran-shack.md) after [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md), finding him consoling his daughter [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md). It becomes clear that they are both elves. In the pair she and the party find a loving father who is taking care of his four year old daughter as they search for a new home.

The party learn that the Montel and his wife [Vensys Leithran](../characters/vensys-leithran.md) were originally from the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), fleeing after a family disagreement. They emigrated to the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) via [Mossband](../places/settlements/villages/mossband.md), [Blittergate](../places/settlements/towns/blittergate.md), and then [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md), where they lived for four years, Vensys giving birth to Esme not long after they arrived.

Through context clues the party piece together that Vensys died in [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md), causing Montel and Esme to flee. They are now searching for a new home in [Kardanis](../places/topography/continents-islands/kardanis.md) or the [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md), but Montel doesn't really have a plan. They ended up on the [Humar Estuary](../places/topography/swamps-deltas/humar-estuary.md) and have been staying in this shack for several days, looking to avoid the [Great Astor Road](../places/roads/great-astor-road.md) above all else.

In the morning when Torbra learns that Esme is an earth genasi like her, her desire to see them reach safety grows. Torbra tells of [Iredale](../places/settlements/towns/iredale.md) where Torbra grew up and their acceptance of her, despite her being different. Montel feels that the town could be a good place to try despite it having no elves.

The party agree to bring Montel and Esme with them as they continue their mission, intent on at least getting them off of the estuary after they find what they are looking for.

### [PR34](../sessions/PR34.md)

[Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) continue their search for the [Humar Meteorite crater](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/humar-meteorite-crater.md) with [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md).

Along the way they witness many instances of Esme amusing herself as best as she can while Montel keeps her mind off their barren surroundings. During the evening while camping [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) plays sword fighting with Esme using sticks. Montel remarks that Esme will likely want to be an adventurer after the pair's time spent with the party on the [Humar Estuary](../places/topography/swamps-deltas/humar-estuary.md).

When [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) suggests that Montel and Esme keep a good distance to avoid incoming danger, Montel gets panicked, now married to the idea of staying as close to [Starfall squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) as possible until they get out of the estuary. He again reiterates his unwillingness to fight and his plan to flee with Esme at the first sign of danger.

### [PR35](../sessions/PR35.md)

During the fight with the giant crocodile at the [Humar Meteorite Crater](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/humar-meteorite-crater.md), [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) keep their distance and hide in the nearby grass.

When the fight ends and it becomes clear that [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) has died, Montel returns to the party, apologising for not being able to do more. [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) tell him that it's not his fault. Esme is crying due to taking emotional cues from her father.

When the party hug, Esme hugs [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md)'s leg. She takes Esme in her lap. When Esme asks where [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) is, Torbra breaks the news to her before Esme tells Montel that it is just like her mother ([Vensys Leithran](../characters/vensys-leithran.md)).

### [PR36](../sessions/PR36.md)

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) lead [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) off the [Humar Estuary](../places/topography/swamps-deltas/humar-estuary.md) and through [Fort Eldrick](../places/settlements/forts/fort-eldrick.md) without any incident. They are able to pass through without arousing suspicion due to head wraps made by [Saoirse รณ Dochartaigh](../characters/saoirse-o-dochartaigh.md) and [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md), as well as the squad's plan to claim that the pair are being escorted as part of [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) business. The [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) lead by [Bevan Lancaster](../characters/bevan-lancaster.md) were eventually satisfied that the pair were none of their business.

Arriving back in [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md), [Torbra Tauff](../characters/torbra-tauff.md) attempted to lead Montel and Esme through the [Northhaven Wall](../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md) to [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) in [Tenterfell House](../places/buildings/government/tenterfell-house.md). The pair were stopped for not having [military badges](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md). After an argument with the guards, Torbra fetched Elysia, who was annoyed at being dragged into Torbra's mess. She gave the pair a gold coin and told them to stay at an inn overnight. Montel was visibly shaken and did what he was told.

Later that evening Torbra visited the pair at [Lionel's Rest](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/lionels-rest.md). Montel makes it clear that they will depart for [Iredale](../places/settlements/towns/iredale.md) in the morning. After making sure they were okay she wrote a letter to [Hjalmann Craggbeard](../characters/hjalmann-craggbeard.md) and passed it to Montel. In it she explained the pair's need for a new home in [Iredale](../places/settlements/towns/iredale.md) and implored Hjalmann to treat them the way she was treat. Torbra alludes to Esme being like her.

Torbra says her goodbyes to Montel and Esme, giving Montel 5 gp more to aid in their travel and to set up their new life in [Iredale](../places/settlements/towns/iredale.md).

### [PR41](../sessions/PR41.md)

While in [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md), [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) chat with [Jonwen Cryss](../characters/jonwen-cryss.md) in [Two Anchors House](../places/buildings/inns-taverns/two-anchors-house.md). Unbeknownst to the party, Jonwen converses with them because he wishes to keep tabs on [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) passing through [Hyceodd](../places/settlements/towns/hyceodd.md), wishing to keep them away from [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/criminals/the-crimson-blades.md)' operations in the town.

[Jonwen Cryss](../characters/jonwen-cryss.md) ordered the death of [Vensys Leithran](../characters/vensys-leithran.md), leading to the party's encounter with [Montel Leithran](../characters/montel-leithran.md) and [Esme Leithran](../characters/esme-leithran.md) on the [Humar Estuary](../places/topography/swamps-deltas/humar-estuary.md).
