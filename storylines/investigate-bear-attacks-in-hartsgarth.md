## History

## [AA02](../sessions/AA02.md)

[Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) gives both of his squads their missions at the same time, in each other's presence. [Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) is tasked with heading to Hartsgarth to investigate reports of bear attacks there. [Darius Dunn](../characters/darius-dunn.md) is made acting [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md), and tasked with bringing back bear claws as proof of culling if necessary.

[Ruby Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/ruby-squad.md) heads out, going their separate way to [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md).

## Planning

Upon their return, they report that they have killed 3 brown bears living in a cave on the outskirts of town, and have brought back bear claws as proof.

[Bryce Morton](../characters/bryce-morton.md) is happy with this outcome.
