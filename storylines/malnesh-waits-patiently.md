## Summary

A means of conversing with [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) exists within [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md). She reached out to [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) while inside its pocket dimension. What does the Judge Mother want?

## History

### [MC02](../sessions/MC02.md)

While inside the [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md) pocket dimension, the party are picked off one by one by Chausain Guards, ejected one by one. Eventually only [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) remains. At the moment he passes out, he hears a voice around him in the black void:

*[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md):*
> I'll be waiting for you.

### [MC04](../sessions/MC04.md)

#### Valan [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) Dream 1

During his sleep after returning to [the Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) in [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md), Valan begins to dream. He finds himself standing on a grassy hill overlooking the [Gulf of Tanelle](../places/seas-oceans/gulf-of-tanelle.md) from where [Arrepont](../places/cities/arrepont.md) would be. It is dark but illuminated by the moon to the west, the reflection of which can be seen illuminating the gulf and its river branches to the north and south. The grass surrounding him is long and blows gently in the night breeze, moving like the surface of the water.

Valan observes the moon which begins to turn pink and finally magenta, glowing so bright that all surface details fade into a single uniform magenta disc. A female voice echoes around the space as it talks to Valan:

*[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md):*
> I'm still waiting for you.

*[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md):*
> Who are you? What are you? Where am I? What do you want with me?

*[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md):*
> You will see in time. You're on the right path.

*[Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md):*
> The path to where?

*[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md):*
> The path home.

The moon reverts to its typical white state. Valan's vision goes black as the dream ends.
