## History

### [MC02](../sessions/completed/MC02.md)

While inside the [Fall of Chausain Memory Sphere](../items/memory-spheres/fall-of-chausain-memory-sphere.md)'s pocket dimension, the party are picked off one by one by Chausain Guards, ejected one by one. Eventually only [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) remains. At the moment he passes out, he hears a voice around him in the black void:

*[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md):*
> I'll be waiting for you.
