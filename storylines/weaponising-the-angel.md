## Summary

After seeing [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) compete in [Nature's Battle 28](ended/natures-battle-28.md) and sprout Radiant Soul wings, the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) considers harnessing her unique abilities in the [Astor-Syntenne War](../history/events/astor-syntenne-war.md).

## History

### [PR36](../sessions/PR36.md)

On return to [Northhaven](../places/settlements/cities/northhaven.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) informs [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) that she has received a letter ([L-PR-06](../letters/L-PR-06.md)). She waits to open it in private. After doing so and confused by the wording concerning her invite of an audience with General Supreme [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md), she accidentally accepts the invite, getting teleported to [Supreme Hall](../places/buildings/government/supreme-hall.md).

### [PR36T](../sessions/PR36T.md)

Now in [Supreme Hall](../places/buildings/government/supreme-hall.md), [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) meets [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md) and [Patricia Wilbenotel](../characters/patricia-wilbenotel.md), who were discussing her at the time of her appearance. Patricia leaves so that Corville can speak with Thanea privately.

Corville is interested in Thanea's unique abilities, getting her to demonstrate her Radiant Soul wings to him. He compares his Kalashtar powers to her own, noting that they are both able to exhibit magical effects despite being in the presence of an anti-magic field. He interrogates Thanea on her origin and background, ensuring she is not a [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) spy. He is content with her answers through which she conveys her orphan and forest upbringings.

Before they part, Corville praises Thanea's abilities, noting that they will come useful. He wishes her well, advising she stays out of trouble while working on meteoric research for the [Astorrel](../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md). Thanea is sent back to the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/settlements/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md)

### Between Sessions

With [Corville Thornox](../characters/corville-thornox.md)'s approval [Patricia Wilbenotel](../characters/patricia-wilbenotel.md) reaches out to [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md) about [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md), requesting that he relinquish her to the [Astornox](../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) for combat training. Quinn refuses, stating that as [Astornox Major](../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-major.md) of Phenomena he needs Thanea's talents in investigating the meteoric threat, impressing upon her the urgency of their mission. Patricia relents but warns Quinn that the [Astornar](../organisations/government/astornar.md) need to see progress or he will be overruled.

In turn Quinn meets with [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) to inform her of the situation. He is candid with her about the specifics of his conversation with Patricia, making it clear that he has done what he can, but Elysia's squads now need to deliver. Elysia is bullish when explaining Thanea's importance to her work - a combination of her knowledge of [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md) and her abilities, which haven't been lost on Elysia.

Elysia promises results as soon as her squads return from their missions. She negotiates with Quinn, securing increased funding if those results keep the [Astornar](../organisations/government/astornar.md) happy.

*See: [Astral Squad Return to Goldreach](astral-squad-return-to-goldreach.md)*

When [Astral Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) return from [Goldreach](../places/settlements/towns/goldreach.md) and [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md) gives his mission report to Elysia, it is clear that the death of one [Meteoric Watcher](../creatures/meteoric-watcher.md) won't be enough to appease Quinn. Elysia confides in Hidaar that if [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) don't return with revelations, her entire operation could collapse.

## Planning

[Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) will keep her conversations with [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md) private, though it will increase the pressure she puts on both [Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md) and [Astral Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) on finding more information out about [the meteorics](../lineages/the-meteorics.md).

[Starfall Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/starfall-squad.md)'s report on the [Tresenda Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md) will be well received by Elysia who will take the report straight to Quinn. This will allay the [Astornar](../organisations/government/astornar.md)'s demands for a time. Quinn will uphold his promise, granting additional funding to Elysia, who will in turn dish some of it out to both squads so that they may be better prepared for their next run-in with the creatures.
