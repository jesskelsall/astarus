## History

### [AA13](../sessions/AA13.md)

While fighting gnolls that ambushed [Canary Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/canary-squad.md) during the night on their journey to [Blittergate](../places/towns/blittergate.md), [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) calls upon [Nills](../characters/nills.md) by casting Summon Shadowspawn, asking for her help in combat. The entire party sees [Nills](../characters/nills.md) for the first time and hears Noon conversing with her:

*[Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md):*
> I think we could do with your help on this one [sister shadow](../characters/nills.md).

*[Nills](../characters/nills.md):*
> Yes of course [brother light](../characters/noon-schiller.md), it would be my pleasure.

As instructed, [Nills](../characters/nills.md) arrives with a piercing scream that frightens many of the gnolls and [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md). [Nills](../characters/nills.md) runs off into the dark to confront the gnoll pack lord but proves less useful than expected in dispatching him.
