## Summary

[Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) sees a rival [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) adventurer in [Drendoc the Warrior](../characters/drendoc.md), a confident up and coming hero of some renown.

## History

### [MC01F](../sessions/completed/MC01F.md)

While [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) is at [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) for [Vulpes Geen](../characters/vulpes-geen.md)'s funeral, [Drendoc](../characters/drendoc.md) arrives with a donation of 50 gp for [Familia Vulpes](../organisations/familia-vulpes.md), earning him an announcement from the Father of the Door, [Hanz Peacemaker](../characters/hanz-peacemaker.md).

Walking through the banquet hall proudly holding the heavy bag of gold coins aloft, Vētrall remarks to [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) that [Drendoc](../characters/drendoc.md) is a show off. Vētrall is annoyed that [Drendoc](../characters/drendoc.md) has upstaged them despite giving a well received lute performance just before.
