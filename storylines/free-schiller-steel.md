## Summary

After [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) competed in [Nature's Battle 27](natures-battle-27.md), [Bernard Horace Schiller](../characters/bernard-horace-schiller.md) provides him with the means to acquire a [Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) weapon for free.

## History

## [AA10](../sessions/AA10.md)

On the day of the [Nature's Battle 27](natures-battle-27.md) final, [Noon Schiller](../characters/noon-schiller.md) comes down for breakfast in the [Eskrigg Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/eskrigg-astorrel-stronghold.md) and is given a letter ([Schiller Weapon Offer](../papers/letters/schiller-weapon-offer.md)) by an [Astorrel member](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md). This provides Noon with the "family rate" prices for all weapons offered, as well as the provision to gain one free of charge for his own use.

He informs [Ahsha Sallas](../characters/ahsha-sallas.md) and [Ephaine Seren](../characters/ephaine-seren.md) that he has the means of acquiring [Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) should they want to buy weapons made of it. Ahsha realises that Noon is part of the family that makes the weapons. The party gets excited at the prospect and chooses to spend their morning looking at examples of the weapons.

At [Schiller Steel Eskrigg](../places/buildings/shops/schiller-steel-eskrigg.md) the party meets [Callum Briar](../characters/callum-briar.md), the shopkeeper. He is terrified and submissive of Noon throughout. Ahsha gets to hold a [Schiller steel](../items/weapons/schiller-steel.md) greataxe.

When Noon asks to buy the greataxe and 3 daggers, Callum provides the "family rate" price which is well in excess of what the party can afford. Noon tries to convince him to put the greataxe on his father's tab, but Callum is too fearful of losing his life for the transgression. Ultimately the party walk out of the shop empty handed.
