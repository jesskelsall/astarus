## Summary

Strange meteors are bringing unknown and dangerous creatures to Astor. Their dangerous nature and consistent arrival is concerning those who are paying close attention.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) Prelude

6 months prior to the start of the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) campaign, [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) notices strange meteors crashing to the ground within the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). They take it upon themselves to investigate them outside of their regular [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) mission duties.

For the last 6 months, a meteor has fallen roughly once a month.

One member of [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) is a seer who has been able to predict when and where several of the meteors will land. This leads [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) to set off for [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) 5 days before the meteor lands, arriving only 2 days after it does.

Wrenn intends to find the meteorite and return it to [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md) so that they may investigate its properties and nature, furthering their independent research.

### [PR01](../sessions/PR01.md)

[Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) meets the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) party, offering them up to 50 gp if they are able to bring him evidence of the meteorite - ideally the meteorite itself.

### [PR06](../sessions/PR06.md)

In [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), the party discover that half of the wolf pack had been slaughtered by something deeper within, a forboding omen.

Delving deeper into the cave, they find the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md), emitting bright white light, and a Meteoric Watcher, searching through the bodies of its victims. When the party is in the line of sight of the meteorite, it turns purple, alerting the watcher to their presence.

### [PR07](../sessions/PR07.md)

The party fights two Meteoric Watchers who are seemingly protecting the meteorite, though in reality they are testing the party's combat prowess like those that came before.

Their grey formless face and body, with its weird 6 limb arrangement is foreign to the party. They are a force to be reckoned with, but eventually the party dispatches them, turning them to grey dust with their final blows.

### [PR11](../sessions/PR11.md)

While examining the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor and hearing the party's stories of how they triumphed in the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md), [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) uses language such as "I've never seen a specimen like this", alluding to other meteors. [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) attempts to question him on this, but Wrenn diverts the conversation, pressing them for further details instead.

When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) asks Wrenn if it would be possible to join the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) due to the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) find, Wrenn starts a sentence about his colleagues in the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) and the work they are doing to learn about the Meteoric Threat, he stops himself before he can reveal anything, telling the group that he can't say anymore. He falls silent, ending the conversation immediately.

In reaction to this, [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) casts Detect Thoughts to read Wrenn's current thoughts. She learns that he is conflicted - [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) needs help with their work, but he fears how [Tyburn Dalvos](../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md) and [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) would react if he involved others without their consent.

This provides [Thanea](../../../astarus/people/thanea.md) with a cryptic window into why Wrenn was interested in the meteorite in the first place. She chooses not to react and keeps the information to herself.

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

While in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), the party is visited by [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md), [Astorrel Squad Lead](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md) of [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), which [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) belongs to. She sees [Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) holding the [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md) Meteor and is shocked, immediately demanding to know how the party came to possess it.

The party explains that they got it from the [Hawkswood Wolf Cave](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/hawkswood-wolf-cave.md) after fighting 2 Meteoric Watchers which they killed, turning them to dust. [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) put them onto the search for the meteorite, and then fled with him from the town.

Elysia is impressed both by their strength and that they possess a meteorite in such good condition. She explains that [Astral Squad](../organisations/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) have been searching for other meteorites, having gathered limited information so far. She is scared shitless by the prospect of the meteorites potentially being a concerted effort, and speculates that they may be a form of magic being employed by the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md). This would break the Astor-Syntenne War's armistice, leading back to open confrontation.

With this in mind, she cautions the party to keep the meteorite hidden and not speak of this to anyone else, as if word gets out, there may be a mass panic. She wants to gather more evidence before taking the matter higher up the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md)'s chain of command.

The party agrees to do so, finding her trustworthy.

### [PR19](../sessions/PR19.md)

When [Elysia Vanderboss](../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) visited the party again in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md), she made her intent clear. If the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) win the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) trial over [the firbolg controversy](the-firbolg-controversy.md), she would use her remaining political influence to try and get the party instated as an [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) squad and work alongside her squad on the meteoric threat.

When she asks the party if they would be interested in doing so, they respond in a non-committal manner, not wishing at such an early stage.
