## Summary

Finding [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md) in possession of the party in [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md), the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) work to recover an artifact of the Elves of Chausain that they consider to be their heritage and property.

## History

### [MC03](../sessions/MC03.md)

When the party stroll into [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md), they are stopped at a [Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) checkpoint and their possessions are searched. This is a routine stop that they are allowed to do due to the agreement between [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md) and the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) over guard duties in the town.

One of the guards discovers [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md) on [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md), hidden in a lead lined box. The alarm is raised and before they know it, they are all under arrest for smuggling and possessing an ancient artifact. The statement shocks the entire party, most not even knowing that Vētrall possessed the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md).

While in jail, [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) conspires with his [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) contacts in the town to break the party out of jail. The [Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) jail is emptied and a skimmer contact acting as an assassin breaks into their cell, falling unconscious in the subsequent fight, providing them with weapons and a key to escape with.

Aside from a couple of lingering guards that the party subdues, the jail is empty and their possessions are found in a storage area. The [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) and its box is still amongst them, placed there by the [Marsh Skimmers](../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) after it was seized by the [Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md).

After escaping, [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) pulls the party into a building. Here he explains that the artifact is prized by the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) who believe such things are their property through their continuation of the culture of the Elves of Chausain. He makes it clear that he has no interest of it falling into the hands of the republic and allows them to leave with it.

### Between Sessions

[Republic Guards](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) relay the existence of a [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md) to their superiors in the republic via the Sending spell. They also provide descriptions of all four members of the party. An effort by the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) begins to locate the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md). Elements of the Veritacris spring into action, beginning their journey to [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md).

### [MC04](../sessions/MC04.md)

When [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) shows [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) [Mémoire de Défaite](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-defaite.md) and she gets to inspect it, she impresses upon the party the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md)'s stance on artifacts of the Elves of Chausain. They consider artifacts from their originating civilisation to be their heritage and property as they see themselves as direct successors.

As part of her deal to be their patron in learning more about the [memory sphere](../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memory-sphere.md), Oriel asks them not to speak of their encounter, impressing upon them the diplomatic incident that would arise if the republic knew that a [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md) arch-mage let someone leave with such an artifact.
