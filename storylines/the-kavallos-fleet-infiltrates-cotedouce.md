## Summary

Having captured [The Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) on the Kavallos Sea, [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) hobgoblins are attempting to infiltrate the town of [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) in preparation for a larger attack from the sea.

## History

### [MC03](../sessions/MC03.md)

While in a [Republic Guard](../organisations/guards/republic-guard.md) jail, [Vētrall Astérr](../characters/vetrall-asterr.md) and [Valan Shadowgaze](../characters/valan-shadowgaze.md) overhear the guards talking in elvish about [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md) being late, there being a problem, and the need for a strong guard presence when it arrives. They don't realise that they are talking about a ship.

After escaping the jail and meeting [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md), [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) offers some information that may help the party leave [Côtedouce](../places/towns/cotedouce.md) to pursue their own goals. He tells them of [the Mistral](../places/ships/the-mistral.md), a ship that docked yesterday. It reported a disease onboard, so [Captain Gill](../characters/clef-gill.md) asked the guards to quarantine the ship, which they did. [Grouper](../characters/grouper.md)'s spies learned that there is no disease, it being used as a cover for [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) spies who infiltrated the ship on the Kavallos Sea. They plan to infiltrate the town and destroy its defences before a larger naval attack arrives.

[Grouper](../characters/grouper.md) gives the party a Kavallos longsword as proof, advising them to either defend the town or bring the plot to the attention of its arch-mage [Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md). They choose to do the latter, travelling to the [Tour de la Côte](../places/buildings/government/tour-de-la-cote.md) and meeting with her after convincing a guard outside of the story.

Oriel is troubled by their story, especially as she is close friends with [Captain Gill](../characters/clef-gill.md). She won't reallocate any of the [Unicorn Cavalry](../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) to help, but supports them in their endeavour. She points out the location of the ship and the town's sea wall with cannons on top, advising they either guard the ship or the cannons. [Keranios](../characters/keranios.md) suggests the spies may already be ashore, so the party agree to head to the cannons.

[Oriel Elsandoral](../characters/oriel-elsandoral.md) tells the party that if they're right and they are able to prevent the attack, they will have earned her favour. The party leaves to go and guard the cannons.
