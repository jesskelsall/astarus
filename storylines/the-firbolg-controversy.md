## Summary

For some time the classification of firbolgs as people of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), rather than as part of the forest, has been a topic of controversy. The [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have been indecisive in addressing this issue.

The conscription of [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) based on their race alone brings this issue to the attention of the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) who must pass judgement.

## History

### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) Prelude

Firbolgs have existed in [South East Kardan](../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md) for at least as long as the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) has. They keep to themselves in their tribal settlements, deep in the woods of Astor.

More recently, the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) have taken an active interest in firbolgs, classifying them as inherently [magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md) and conscripting them into military service on sight. So far this has only applied to firbolgs they have found in Astor settlements, or those who wander too far from the depths of the forests.

So far the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have been indifferent to this behaviour, though as the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) become more blatant about capturing firbolgs and educating people on their apparent danger, some within the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) have started to feel particularly uncomfortable about the practice, feeling that firbolgs are part of nature rather than civilisation, and as such should be protected by the [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md).

While there are outspoken [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) who wish to oppose the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md)'s actions, [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md), [Astorrel Commandant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md), and those directly beneath them, have so far not declared a formal stance.

### [PR15](../sessions/PR15.md)

When [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) meets [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md), the party become aware of the firbolg controversy and the two opposing views present within the [Astornox](../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md). They explain that what has happened to [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md) may be the catalyst that brings the issue to a head, with a trial conducted by the [Astornar](../organisations/astornar.md) being a likely outcome.

As a fervent supporter of protecting firbolg as part of nature, Hidaar offers to help the party in any way they can, ordering [Sparrow on the Autumn Pine](../characters/sparrow-on-the-autumn-pine.md) to escort them to [Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) so they can seek [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) there.

### [PR18](../sessions/PR18.md)

[Saoirse](../../../astarus/people/saoirse.md) mentions [Wizira's Father](../characters/wiziras-father.md)'s capture to [Garrick Rose](../characters/garrick-rose.md) while they are preparing to go into [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). He assures the party that if the [Astorrel Commandant](../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-commandant.md) can't help them, he will ensure that someone looks into the matter for them.

[Levelle Tristwix](../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) visits the party in [The Sanctum](../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) on the morning of their first full day in [sanctuary](../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md). They speak with [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) about her father, talking about how his capture fits into the firbolg controversy as a whole. Levelle finds [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) well informed and explains that there are conflicts in other places such as the [Mocker Swamp](../places/forests/mocker-swamp.md).

Levelle asks what the rest of the party's involvement is in this matter, but they met [Wizira](../characters/wizira.md) after her father disappeared.
