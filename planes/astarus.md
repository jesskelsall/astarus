# Astarus

## Summary

Astarus is a planet/plane and the primary setting of campaigns in this homebrew setting.

## Geography

*See: [Naissance Calendar](../history/calendars/naissance-calendar.md)*  
*See: [Astorian Calendar](../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md)*

A medium sized habitable planet with a single moon.

- Solar cycle: 225 days.
- Lunar cycle: 28 days.
- Day length: 24 hours.

It is dominated by the continent of [Kardan](../places/continents/kardan.md) and is largely surrounded by oceans.

## Magic

*See also: [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md)*

There is magic in this world, though it is uncommon. As a result many people have never seen magic in person before.

Those who wield magic are born with an innate ability to wield it. It is not hereditary and there is often no rhyme or reason to who has magical abilities, with roughly 5% of all people possessing such abilities. As a result, magic users are in high demand or are able to exert their power to command others.

Non-magic people are often fearful of those who possess it, as it often spells trouble for those who stay close.

## [Gods](../gods/gods.md)

The influence of the [gods](../gods/gods.md) is minimal on Astarus, to the point that most people worship their god/[gods](../gods/gods.md) on faith alone. Many others believe that the [gods](../gods/gods.md) do not or no longer exist.

In reality, Astarus creates difficulties for divine magic that almost entirely diminishes the influence of the [gods](../gods/gods.md). Their presence is limited to small actions that focus on individual people, rather than grand gestures of power.

## History

*See: [Timeline](../history/timeline.md)*

Astarus used to be a lifeless planet. It was nurtured by [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) who created all plant life and animals, making the planet habitable.

Throughout the history of Astarus, various [gods](../gods/gods.md) have created intelligent races or brought them here from [Oonar](oonar.md):

|| [The First Coming](../history/events/the-first-coming.md) | [The Second Coming](../history/events/the-second-coming.md) | [The Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **God(s)** | [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) | [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md) | [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md)<br>[Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md)<br>[Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md)<br>[Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md) |
| **Race(s)** | Dragon<br>Giant<br>[Strigid](../lineages/strigid.md) | Elf | Dragonborn<br>Gnome<br>Goliath<br>Halfling<br>Human<br>Orc<br>Tabaxi<br>Tiefling<br>*(non-exhaustive)* |

From these people, the following civilisations have emerged:

- [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md)
- [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md)
- [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)
- [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md)
- [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md)
