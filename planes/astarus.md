# Astarus

Astarus is the name given to the plane of existence that the campaign is set in. It is the world that the [players](../players/logan.md) inhabit.

## [Gods](../gods/gods.md)

On Astarus the influence of the [gods](../gods/gods.md) is minimal. Most people believe that they exist, but there is very rarely any indication of this outside of their belief.

- [The Order of the Diamond](../organisations/the-order-of-the-diamond.md): the Astor state religion.

## Mortals

Astarus is populated by a typical mix of D&D races.

[Kardan](../places/continents/kardan.md) is predominately populated with the following races:

- [Human](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/human)
- [Halfling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/halfling)
- [Elf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/elf)
- [Dwarf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/dwarf)

In lesser numbers there are also the following known races, in descending order of number:

- [Tiefling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/tiefling)
- [Gnome](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/gnome)
- [Half-Orcs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/half-orc)
- [Tabaxi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/tabaxi)
- [Firbolg](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/firbolg)
- [Kenku](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/kenku)
- [Genasi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/genasi)
- [Aasimar](../lineages/aasimar.md)

From these peoples, the following civilisations have emerged:

- [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) (human, halfling, gnome).
- [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md) (elf, half-elf).
- [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md) (dwarf).

## Magic

*See also: [Magicborn](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/magicborn.md)*

There is magic in this world, though it is uncommon. Most people have never seen magic in practice before.

Those who wield magic are born with an innate ability to wield it. It is not hereditary and there is often no rhyme or reason to who has magical abilities. As a result, magic users are in high demand or are able to exert their power to command others.

Non-magic people are often fearful of those who possess it, as it often spells trouble for those who stay close.

## History

Astarus is relatively new. This means that the land is largely unexplored, unsettled, and devoid of ruins.

### Date System

### Beginning of the World

Astarus was formed in *176 AA* (488 years ago) by the insider [gods](../gods/gods.md). This was within two generations of history for some of the longer lived races.
