## Military Badge

*See: [Military badges](../../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md)*

Astorrel Squad Sergeant badges look like plain [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) [military badges](../../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md), but with a strip of gold inlaid inside its bottom edge. The use of gold denotes an officer rank.

# Duties

Astorrel Squad Sergeants are tasked with running one or more [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) squads.

Each Squad Sergeant is provided multiples of four Squad Hands that they organise into squads of four. They have the ability to change who is in which squad as they see fit, providing the Squad Hands and Squad Leads are their subordinates.

Squad Sergeants can promote Squad Hands to Squad Leads, providing there is only one Squad Lead per squad. Making these promotions usually fixes the composition of their squads as a result.

They are provided missions by their commanding [Astorrel Lieutenant](astorrel-lieutenant.md). It is up to them how they distribute the missions amongst their squads.

# Pay

Squad Sergeants are paid per mission, by their Squad Lieutenant. It is up to a Squad Sergeant to take a cut from the mission bounty, leaving the rest for distribution to the Squad Lead and Squad Hands.

As their Squad Lieutenant determines how much the mission bounty is worth, and the Squad Sergeant determines how much of a cut to take, a Squad Sergeant's pay can vary mission-to-mission, and is not always comparable to that of other Squad Sergeants.

Some Squad Sergeants are greedier than others with their cut of mission bounties, leaving less for the squads. However, most understand that mission success comes most often when their squads are well geared and motivated.

Other Squad Sergeants choose to distribute their mission bounties under other systems, such as splitting bounties between all of their squads, not just the one that completed the mission.
