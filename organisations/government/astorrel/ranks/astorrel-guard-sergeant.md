## Military Badge

*See: [Military badges](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md)*

[Astorrel Squad Sergeant](astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) badges look like plain [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) [military badges](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md), but with a strip of gold inlaid inside its bottom edge. The use of gold denotes an officer rank.

# Duties

Astorrel Guard Sergeants are charged with protecting [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) strongholds such as the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md). They prevent those without permission to enter from doing so, and keep the peace within.

They oversee a small group of [Astorrel Guards](astorrel-guard.md) who they give orders and ensure they are working effectively. A guard sergeant's guards always work at the same as them as part of a shift. Each stronghold maintains several shifts of guards, with each shift's guard sergeant reporting to a dedicated [Astorrel Lieutenant](astorrel-lieutenant.md) for the city.
