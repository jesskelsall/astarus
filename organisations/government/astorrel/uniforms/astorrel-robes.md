## Summary

Astorrel Robes are a uniform of the [Astorrel](../astorrel.md). They are worn both as casual city wear, as well as for ceremonial purposes. Wearing them is considered to be an overt display of your membership of the [Astorrel](../astorrel.md).

As outside of ceremonies there is no set dress code within [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) strongholds, [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) are not obliged to wear their robes, though it is considered respectful to, especially when within the presence of superior officers, especially high ranking ones.

All [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) are provided with Astorrel robes when they join the organisation.

## Description

Ankle length multi-layered robes with crossing material forming a v-neck shape. Long sleeves on the under layer. Accompanied by a leather belt with a metal buckle, and cloth wrap shoes with leather soles.

Coloured to match [Kirrel](../../../../gods/deities/kirrel.md)'s symbol: green chest, mint green sleeves, teal decorative mid-layer, blue skirt. Thick black trim around the edges of the top and sleeve cuffs.

## Variants

### Officer Robes

The officer robes variant has golden yellow trim as opposed to black. The use of gold in the [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) signifies the rank of officer. This is accompanied by a gold plated belt buckle.

Officers have access to the [Astorrel Officer's Uniform](astorrel-officers-uniform.md), but some choose this variant of the robes instead, preferring the comfort or aesthetics. It can also be seen as less militaristic.

### [Sanctuary](../sanctuary.md) Robes

The [sanctuary](../sanctuary.md) robes variant has white trim as opposed to black, and typically has a less fancy belt buckle. It is only provided to those under [sanctuary](../sanctuary.md) in an [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) stronghold.

The white trim is designed to make it clear that the wearer isn't part of the [Astorrel](../astorrel.md), making it easier to detect someone who breaches the terms of their [sanctuary](../sanctuary.md) and enters the stronghold proper.
