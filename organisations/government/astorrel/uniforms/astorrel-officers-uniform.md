## Summary

The Astorrel Officer's Uniform is a uniform of the [Astorrel](../astorrel.md). It is worn by officers in city settings, as well as for ceremonial purposes. Wearing it is considered to be an overt display of both your membership of the [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) and officer rank.

As outside of ceremonies there is no set dress code within [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) strongholds, [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) officers are not obliged to wear their officer's uniform. Most do however, especially those who spend their time within the city or its stronghold, due to the respect it garners and the status it exudes. For those that don't wear the uniform day-to-day, it is still considered respectful to wear it within the presence of superior officers, especially high ranking ones.

When [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) are promoted to an officer rank or join as one, they are provided a choice between this uniform or the [Astorrel robes](astorrel-robes.md) (officer variant). There is little significance or judgement for which the officer picks, and they may pay for the other uniform any time they wish.
