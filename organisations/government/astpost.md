## Summary

Astpost is an organisation of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). It acts as the postal service for military organisations that need to send letters and packages to individuals across [South East Kardan](../../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md).

Given someone's name, rank, and location, they are able to deliver for cheaper rates than [Sunset Delivery](../business/sunset-delivery.md). Their services are only available for those with a military badge, and they only deliver to established military strongholds across the kingdom.

## Address Format

- Name.
- Organisation and Rank.
- Role (Major & subdivision).
- Stronghold.

Example:

> [Bryce Morton](../../characters/bryce-morton.md)  
> [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md)  
> Cities / [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md)  
> [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md)

## Process

Letters / packages are transferred directly to the specified stronghold, providing the rest of the address seems reasonable.

Once there, it is delivered by the stronghold's postmaster to the individual directly, or to their superior officer if a fixed address isn't known. If this is also true of their superior officer, this process can continue further up the chain of command.

Some strongholds, particularly smaller ones in towns, hold all incoming post in a room near the gatehouse. The guards on duty are then made aware of who has post to collect and informs them as they enter the stronghold.

## Price

As a benchmark, sending a letter directly from one city to the next costs 1 sp. Costs are higher when delivering to strongholds away from the [Great Astor Road](../../places/roads/great-astor-road.md).
