## Summary

Waldwächter is the guard force of [Valburg](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md).

Waldwächters are appointed by the local Knight and are typically medium to upper class, often appointed through pre-established relationships. Those who serve as Waldwächters consider the role to be prestigious and comfortable, as well as a strong indicator of class and character.

They are predominantly found in towns and cities, particularly around wealthier parts and their people. It is rare to see Waldwächters on the road or in villages. Waldwächter are well supplied but rarely get their hands dirty, only unleashing their full potential in matters of corruption and organised crime.

Waldwächters wear chain mail with accents of brown leather, with a brown tabard worn over the top. It bears the symbol of [Valburg](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md), a black symbol of a prancing goat in profile. They don't wear helmets and are armed with standard issue rapiers, as well as light crossbows on occasion.
