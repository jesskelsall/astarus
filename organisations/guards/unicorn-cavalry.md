## Summary

The Unicorn Cavalry is the guard force of [Reimatelau](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md).

They can be found in all [Reimatelau](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md) settlements but take a more passive role in matters than most guard forces. Outside of the settlements they can be seen patrolling the roads on horseback. They are famed for their diligence in these parts, protecting travellers from the jungle and bandits alike.

Unicorn Cavalry wear shiny silver half-plate and full length lime green capes, representing the colour of [Reimatelau](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md). Their horses are similarly adorned in silver and lime green. They favour longer weapons and do not sport shields.
