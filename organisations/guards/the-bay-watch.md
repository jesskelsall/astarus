## Summary

The Bay Watch is the guard force of the [Bay of Splendour](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/bay-of-splendour.md).

They wear leathers with some chain elements, covered by a burned yellow coloured tabard. A belt is worn over this and is used to hold pouches and weapons, typically a mace.

Bay watchers typically have a friendly disposition. They are comfortable being bribed, often expecting it to keep things moving along without issue.
