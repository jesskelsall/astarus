## History

### [Purple Rain](../../../../campaigns/purple-rain/purple-rain.md) Prelude

[Wrenn Piznarck](../../../people/wrenn-piznarck.md) traveled to Carnmere to search for the Carnmere Meteorite. Here, without the knowledge of the rest of [Astral Squad](astorrel/squads/astral.md), he hired The Crimson Blades to retrieve the meteorite for him, offering to pay them more substantially when they returned with it.

After not hearing from them for 3 days, Wrenn got cold feet and left Carnmere for [Northhaven](../../../places/cities/northhaven.md), believing that the mercenary group had simply pocketed his deposit and left. In reality, they succeeded, and still have the Carnmere Meteorite in their possession. [Stalker](../../../people/stalker.md) has sent [Morog Whiteknuckle](../../../people/morog-whiteknuckle.md) with a force to find and capture Wrenn so that they can extort him for their remaining fee.
