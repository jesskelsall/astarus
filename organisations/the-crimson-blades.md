## History

### [Purple Rain](../campaigns/purple-rain.md) Prelude

[Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) traveled to Carnmere to search for the [Carnmere Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/carnmere-meteorite.md). Here, without the knowledge of the rest of [Astral Squad](astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md), he hired The Crimson Blades to retrieve the [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) for him, offering to pay them more substantially when they returned with it.

After not hearing from them for 3 days, Wrenn got cold feet and left Carnmere for [Northhaven](../places/cities/northhaven.md), believing that the mercenary group had simply pocketed his deposit and left. In reality, they succeeded, and still have the [Carnmere Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/carnmere-meteorite.md) in their possession. [Stalker](../characters/stalker.md) has sent [Morog Whiteknuckle](../characters/morog-whiteknuckle.md) with a force to find and capture Wrenn so that they can extort him for their remaining fee.
