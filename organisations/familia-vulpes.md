## Summary

Familia Vulpes is an adventuring guild formed by the Vulpes family. It is comprised of selfless adventurers who enjoy travelling the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) and helping people in need. The organisation fosters a family-like atmosphere where all of its members are treated well.

Their headquarters is [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) in [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md).

## Imagery

### Symbol

The Familia Vulpes logo is a depiction of a fox sitting in front of a starry background surrounded by a thick circle. This image is framed in a portrait rectangle. The entire logo is coloured in shades of tan and brown and decorated with curly and flowing motifs.

The symbol evokes a grand and storied sense of importance.

## Mission

Familia Vulpes' mission is to help those in need. Their members offer their services as adventurers, often solving combat related problems such as killing creatures and rooting out evil wherever it may be.

Typically they offer their services for free, believing that help should not be paid for, but will gladly take pay and support wherever they are offered it. This line of work usually allows Familia Vulpes members to pay for their own equipment and needs. When there is excess pay, members often share this with the organisation itself at [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) as a form of tithe / donation.

Members either work alone or in small groups as needed. It is not uncommon for members to ask others for help on their adventures, achieving more through teamwork. There is little formal structure behind this.

## Reputation

Familia Vulpes is regarded as an organisation of the common people due to their altruistic ideals. Commoners who know of their exploits welcome them with open arms, readily willing to help them out and provide them with work that puts their adventuring skills to good use. Furthermore guards across the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) enjoy their no-nonsense approach to solving problems, particularly as members are usually combat ready and unbound by local politics.

Criminal organisations or those that take advantage of others dislike Familia Vulpes. As members are often willing to confront reports of illegal activities, corruption, and other despicable behaviours, Familia Vulpes is a thorn in the side of any professional operation in this sphere.

## Structure

Familia Vulpes has a very flat structure, regarding as many members as possible as equals. The organisation believes this provides the best environment for friendships and cooperation.

### Vulpes Family

The Vulpes family, a historic family of [Fennecs](../lineages/fennec.md), founded and continues to run Familia Vulpes. Their vision of an adventuring family transformed from a literal to a more metaphorical concept. While Familia Vulpes now includes adventurers from almost every race, the Vulpes family are seen as the leaders of the organisation.

High level decisions are made by the Vulpes Family. As the organisation rarely needs to make any big changes, this means that their influence over other members is light.

### Father of the Door

A senior role given to a masculine member, the Father of the Door guards the entrance to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) in [Trest](../places/towns/trest.md). Their role is both practical and ceremonial.

From a ceremonial standpoint, the Father of the Door opens and closes the door when members come and go. Light conversation keeps them in the loop with the state of the organisation and its members.

They are tasked with ensuring that only members of Familia Vulpes are admitted inside. This is done by checking for a [Coin of Family](../items/coin-of-family.md), though recognising a familiar face is usually enough. This duty extends to welcoming new recruits who show up with a [Coin of Friendship](../items/coin-of-friendship.md), loudly announcing them through the open door to those inside the building:

> Joining us today, please welcome to the family {name}!

The Father of the Door also encourages monetary donations to the organisation through their announcement of someone returning with coin. The coin and its value is presented to the Father of the Door who then announces it to those inside:

> Returning to us, {name}, who has shared {coin} with their family!

### Mother of the House

A senior role given to a feminine member, the Mother of the House takes care of day to day operations in [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md). They are responsible for maintaining the building, making sure that everyone's needs are met, and proliferating information.

As food and drink is provided free of charge in [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) to members, the Mother of the House coordinates the menu and supplies. She takes part in moving food to and from the table, announcing the meal loudly:

> {Meal} is served!

The Mother of the House often walks around the banquet hall, making sure everyone's needs are met. This can mean arranging for specific food to be brought, but the responsibilities are wide ranging.

They are also responsible for keeping track of any notable help that has been requested of Familia Vulpes. When a request is made for help, she ensures that someone is sent.

## Membership

Familia Vulpes members are members for life. They are always welcome to return to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md), no matter how long they have been away. This includes after their adventuring days are behind them.

It is not uncommon for retired members to offer their assistance in running [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) as a chef or other staff. The roles of Father of the Door and Mother of the House are only given to retired members.

Members are identified by their [Coin of Family](../items/coin-of-family.md), given to them upon their joining. This gets them into [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) and proves to others who they are. Often flashing their coin is enough to convince guards of their membership.

### Joining

Members in good standing with Familia Vulpes and/or those that have been a member for some time are given a [Coin of Friendship](../items/coin-of-friendship.md). This is presented to a potential recruit as an invite to join. Members with one of these coins are encouraged to use it when they find someone of adventuring skill and good moral character.

Those given a [Coin of Friendship](../items/coin-of-friendship.md) accept the offer by travelling to [The Fox Hole](../places/buildings/the-fox-hole.md) and giving it to the Father of the Door. They are accepted without question. Once inside the Mother of the House sets them up with a mentor who shows them the ropes of life as a Familia Vulpes member. This is usually followed by the member being given their own [Coin of Family](../items/coin-of-family.md).
