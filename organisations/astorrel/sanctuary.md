# Sanctuary

Sanctuary is a mechanism by which the [Astorrel](astorrel.md) protect one or more people for a limited period, shielding them physically and legally, notably from the [Astornox](../astornox/astornox.md).

It is theoretically available to anyone, regardless of citizenship status, affiliation, or other quality.

*Sanctuary is based on the [medieval right of asylum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum#Medieval_England).*

## Locations

Sanctuary is available at all [Astorrel](astorrel.md) strongholds. Each stronghold has a building that acts as one or more sanctuaries.

| City | Stronghold | Sanctuary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Northhaven](../../places/cities/northhaven.md) | [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) | [The Sanctum](../../places/buildings/the-sanctum.md) |

In order to receive sanctuary, those seeking it must travel themselves to an [Astorrel](astorrel.md) stronghold. At its gatehouse the [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) on duty is able to offer sanctuary.

Many who wish to seek sanctuary are unable or struggle due to the need to travel, especially if they are being pursued by the [Astornox](../astornox/astornox.md). There may also be other barriers to reaching an [Astorrel](astorrel.md) stronghold such as the [Northhaven Wall](../../places/structures/northhaven-wall.md).

## Process

### Seeking Sanctuary

Those seeking sanctuary must first make their way to an [Astorrel](astorrel.md) stronghold.

Once there, they seek sanctuary from the [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) on duty. While their duty is primarily to guard the stronghold from non-[Astorrel](astorrel.md), they are also tasked with facilitating sanctuary.

Their case should be made to the guard sergeant as to why they should be offered sanctuary.

### Offering Sanctuary

It is at the sole discretion of the guard sergeant as to whether to offer sanctuary.

If they choose not to, those seeking sanctuary will not be allowed to enter the stronghold (as normal).

If however they do decide to offer sanctuary, they must explain the following:

- Basic overview of what sanctuary is and how it works.
- A comprehensive overview of how to leave sanctuary and how offering sanctuary is rescinded.
- Explanation of the sanctuary itself and its logistics.

The explanation is important as many within the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) that have heard of sanctuary do not know how it works. This gives those seeking an informed view of what sanctuary is, allowing them to make a decision.

### Accepting Sanctuary

If those seeking sanctuary are happy with the terms, they then verbally accept the offer of sanctuary. They are allowed into the stronghold so that they may enter the sanctuary itself.

#### Declaring the Offer

As the guard sergeant now has to deal with beginning their offer of sanctuary, coupled with a potentially hostile pursuit into the stronghold for those seeking sanctuary, there is an immediate need to bolster the [Astorrel](astorrel.md) presence at the sanctuary's gatehouse.

One of the guard sergeant's guards is tasked with **'declaring the offer'**.

They are given powers to compel *any* [Astorrel](astorrel.md) within the stronghold to guard the gatehouse for as long as it takes for them to be relieved by the next shift's [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) and their guards. They must protect the gatehouse with their life if need be. Failure to rise to this call is a serious offence.

Once the guard has compelled as many [Astorrel](astorrel.md) as they deem necessary, they proceed to the [Astorrel Captain](ranks/astorrel-captain.md) of the stronghold and declare that sanctuary has been offered.

Finally they find the next shift's guard sergeant, make them aware of the situation, and instruct them to begin their shift immediately. Once that happens, the subordinate guards of the guard sergeant offering sanctuary are dismissed from the gatehouse.

### The Sanctuary

The sanctuary is a place, typically one or more rooms or a building, where those offered sanctuary stay for the duration. Each stronghold has its own form of sanctuary, and may have more than one sanctuary depending on city size and frequency of use.

Depending on the setup of the sanctuary, it may feel like a house or a prison cell.

### Sanctuary Rules

The guard sergeant offering sanctuary sets the rules of the sanctuary that those seeking it agree to. They have total authority to choose rules as they see fit, and it does not have to be consistent from one offered sanctuary to the next. This allows the terms of sanctuary to be tailored to the person/group and their circumstances.

As the guard sergeant has total authority, they can set rules which go against the wishes of [Astorrel](astorrel.md) within the stronghold, including superior officers. This only extends to the sanctuary itself however - the guard sergeant can provide those [receiving sanctuary](../../storylines/receiving-sanctuary.md) possessions or information (e.g. local news), but cannot reveal privileged information or bestow [Astorrel](astorrel.md) ranks, for example.

| Possible Rule | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Confiscated weapons | Safety of the guard sergeant and/or visitors. |
| Confiscated items | Wariness of unknown capabilities. |
| Confiscated clothes | Hygiene, symbolism of protection. |
| Meal service | Providing food regardless of means. |
| No visitors | Offer of sanctuary does not concern the [Astorrel](astorrel.md) directly. |
| Private identity | Knowing who they are would bias discussions. |
| Confined | Preserves the security inside the stronghold. |

### The Guard Sergeant's Duties

While the guard sergeant is offering sanctuary, they must remain in or just outside of the sanctuary at all times. This includes going to the toilet or sleeping. The idea is that the guard sergeant is the personal protector of those [receiving sanctuary](../../storylines/receiving-sanctuary.md), and as such cannot protect them if they are not there.

This makes continuing to offer sanctuary an uncomfortable and often boring task, which helps to bring the offer to an end eventually.

While this is happening, the guard sergeant's guards are not part of the gatehouse guard rotation, so they help their superior with anything they need. This often means running menial errands like fetching food and water, but it keeps the guard sergeant where they need to be. It is also designed to foster a shared ownership of protection.

### During Sanctuary

Sanctuary is a temporary arrangement, so those receiving it are aware of their limited time before they must leave. Depending on the person and circumstance, this colours how they spend their time here.

- Living in ignorant bliss of the [Astornox](../astornox/astornox.md)'s judgement.
- Formulating a plan for escaping the [Astornox](../astornox/astornox.md).
- Applying for the [Astorrel](astorrel.md) training programme.

### Ending Sanctuary

When sanctuary ends, in most circumstances those [receiving sanctuary](../../storylines/receiving-sanctuary.md) are cast back out beyond the stronghold's gatehouse to meet their fate.

If those they are hiding from (e.g. the [Astornox](../astornox/astornox.md)) are particularly keen on getting their hands on them, they may well be waiting for their sanctuary to end. In this case, seeking sanctuary was just a delay tactic.

### Leaving

Those [receiving sanctuary](../../storylines/receiving-sanctuary.md) have a right to leave any time they wish. If they are confined there may be a slight delay, but ultimately the guard sergeant must honour their wishes as soon as possible.

### Rescinding

At any point and for any reason, the guard sergeant may rescind their offer of sanctuary. This may be due to a rule broken, changing circumstances, or their unwillingness to continue to perform the duties that come with offering sanctuary.

It is polite to provide some advance notice of this happening, though not required.

Those who refuse to comply are typically removed by force by the guard sergeant's subordinates.
