## History

### Pre-Campaign

Astral Squad used to include [Elysia Vanderboss](../../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) and [Wrenn Piznarck](../../../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md). Under the former's leadership as [Astorrel Squad Lead](../ranks/astorrel-squad-lead.md), the squad were secretly investigating [the meteoric threat](../../../storylines/the-meteoric-threat.md) in their spare time, unwilling to share information with the [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) out of fear of causing a mass panic.

When the [Purple Rain](../../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party were in [sanctuary](../sanctuary.md) in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md), details of their dealings with Wrenn as well as the [Goldreach Meteorite](../../../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) came out. Elysia confided in them, offering to help them in exchange for help with her investigations.

Before the [Astornar](../../astornar.md) trial of [the firbolg controversy](../../../storylines/ended/the-firbolg-controversy.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) told [Levelle Tristwix](../../../characters/levelle-tristwix.md) what she knew about [the meteoric threat](../../../storylines/the-meteoric-threat.md), making a case for a larger [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) investigation. When the [Purple Rain](../../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party joined the [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) as [Starfall Squad](starfall-squad.md), Levelle reorganised a few squads to bring Elysia's plans to fruition.

### Major of Phenomena

Now lead by [Darjonkaargeac Hidaar](../../../characters/darjonkaargeac-hidaar.md), brought in for political reasons due to their involvement in helping the [Purple Rain](../../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) squad infiltrate [Northhaven](../../../places/cities/northhaven.md), Astral Squad has been placed under Elysia's command, under the Major of Phenomena. Alongside [Starfall Squad](starfall-squad.md) they are tasked with investigating [the meteoric threat](../../../storylines/the-meteoric-threat.md).
