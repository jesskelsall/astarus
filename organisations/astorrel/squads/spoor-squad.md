## Summary

Spoor Squad is an [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) squad.

They are based in [Ulburn](../../../places/villages/ulburn.md) at the [Ulburn Astorrel House](../../../places/buildings/ulburn-astorrel-house.md), working alongside [Goshawk Squad](goshawk-squad.md) to ensure that the recent growth of [Ulburn](../../../places/villages/ulburn.md) isn't having too great an effect on the surrounding ecology.
