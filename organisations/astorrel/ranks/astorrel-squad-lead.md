## Military Badge

*See also: [Military badges](../../../military-badges.md)*

Astorrel Squad Lead badges look like plain [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) [military badges](../../../military-badges.md), but with a strip of silver inlaid inside its top and bottom edges. The top strip distinguishes it from the badge of an [Astorrel Squad Hand](2-squad-hand.md).

# Duties

Astorrel Squad Leads are the fourth member of a mission squad, alongside 3 [Astorrel Squad Hands](2-squad-hand.md).

Their duties are to complete missions given to them by their Squad Sergeant, and lead their Squad Hands. This sees them travelling to locations within the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../README.md), talking with locals, seeing the state of the land, and taking action on their Squad Lead's behalf.

Squads are based out of the city that their Squad Sergeant resides in, and so it is typical that they complete missions in the surrounding area.

Due to their leadership role in the squad, Squad Leads gain more recognition for their deeds than the Squad Hands, but also get the blame for failed missions or Squad Hand deaths.

# Pay

Squad Hands are paid per mission, by their Squad Sergeant. A Squad Lead always gets paid more than the Squad Hands in their squad.

As their Squad Sergeant determines how much of the mission bounty to give to the squad, and not all missions pay the same, a Squad Lead's pay can vary mission-to-mission, and is not always comparable to other squads.

# Promotion

Squad Leads can be promoted to [Astorrel Squad Sergeants](4-squad-sergeant.md) when the need arises for a new one to command over new squads. This can happen when the [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) bolsters its numbers, or when another Squad Sergeant is promoted or retires.

Particularly successful squads are most likely to have their Squad Lead promoted, though specialised squads may be left alone if officers believe that their missions would suffer drastically as a result of promotion. This can cause over-performing to backfire.
