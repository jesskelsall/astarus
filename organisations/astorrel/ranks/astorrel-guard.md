# Duties

Astorrel Guards are charged with protecting Astorrel strongholds such as the Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold. They prevent those without permission to enter from doing so, and keep the peace within.

They are attached to an Astorrel Guard Sergeant who runs their shift and provides them with orders.
