## Military Badge

*See also: [Military badges](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md)*

[Astorrel Squad Hand](astorrel-squad-hand.md) badges look like plain [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) [military badges](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md), but with a strip of silver inlaid inside its bottom edge.

# Duties

Astorrel Guards are charged with protecting [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) strongholds such as the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../../places/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md). They prevent those without permission to enter from doing so, and keep the peace within.

They are attached to an [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) who runs their shift and provides them with orders.
