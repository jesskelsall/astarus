## Military Badge

*See also: [Military badges](../../../military-badges.md)*

Astorrel Commandant badges look like plain [Astorrel](../astorrel.md) [military badges](../../../military-badges.md), but with a strip of gold inlaid inside its edges, forming a square. The use of gold denotes an officer rank. The complete enclosure of the gold strip denotes that this is the highest rank of a [Kingdom of Astor](../../../README.md) organisation.
