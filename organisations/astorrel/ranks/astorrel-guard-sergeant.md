# Duties

Astorrel Guard Sergeants are charged with protecting Astorrel strongholds such as the Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold. They prevent those without permission to enter from doing so, and keep the peace within.

They oversee a small group of Astorrel Guards who they give orders and ensure they are working effectively. A guard sergeant's guards always work at the same as them as part of a shift. Each stronghold maintains several shifts of guards, with each shift's guard sergeant reporting to a dedicated Astorrel Lieutenant for the city.
