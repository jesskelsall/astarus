## Summary

Ziegenkrone is a large beer company that sells exclusively in [Valburg](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md). They brew traditional dwarven ale using recipes and techniques from before [The Third Coming](../../history/events/the-third-coming.md), known for its nuanced flavours and ease of drinking due to a lack of alcohol content.

While [Ziegenturm](../../places/buildings/inns-taverns/ziegenturm.md) is Ziegenkrone's flagship tavern, the actual location of their brewery is a closely guarded secret.
