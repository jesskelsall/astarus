## Summary

Dragonbrew is the largest brewing company in the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md). It is well know for its modern take on ale: flavourful, punchy, and strong. Blue Dragon is their best selling ale.

Despite its origins in [Valburg](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md), Dragonbrew is owned and operated predominantly dragonborn, one of the biggest groups of their lineage to not live in [the Dragonbrand](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/the-dragonbrand.md).

The Brew's Lair is Dragonbrew's largest tavern and the site of their main brewery.

Dragonbrew is a homage to [Brewdog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrewDog).
