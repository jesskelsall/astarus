## Summary

The Marsh Skimmers are a criminal syndicate that helped found the city of [Murkwallow](../places/cities/murkwallow.md) in the [Scintil Delta](../places/rivers-lakes/scintil-delta.md). They have grown into a large organisation that spans the entire [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md), following profit wherever they can find it.

Their headquarters is [Tabaxi's Folly](../places/buildings/tabaxis-folly.md) in [Murkwallow](../places/cities/murkwallow.md).

## Imagery

### Symbol

The Marsh Skimmers logo is of a turquoise dragonfly. It is typically surrounded by circles and a diamond that include stars and circles.

The logo is not generally used due to the need to remain clandestine. It features most prominently on letters passed between skimmers directly, avoiding the local postal systems.

## Mission

Profit is the guiding goal of the Marsh Skimmers, and by any means possible. With this single principal they are able to justify almost any criminal activities they see fit, flagrantly disregarding the laws of the states they operate within. This drive for profit drives skimmers to work together, knowing that the largest paydays only come when many people work in tandem.

Marsh Skimmers engage in all sorts of crime, particularly theft, assassination, and smuggling. Their lack of morals mean that they are willing to take the grisly jobs that other criminal organisations would shy away from.

## Reputation

As a criminal syndicate, the Marsh Skimmers are reviled by law enforcement of all kinds, particularly state guards. In many cases it is even illegal to be associated with the organisation. This makes it essential for a skimmer to keep their affiliation a secret. Oddly, skimmers that are cornered with no chance of escape proudly proclaim their membership with pride while refusing to divulge details of their fellow skimmers.

Marsh Skimmers are begrudgingly tolerated by other criminal organisations. As skimmers tend not to abide by unwritten criminal codes of conduct, they have a negative reputation in these circles. However because of this, skimmers are willing to challenge other organisations, which causes those organisations to give the Marsh Skimmers a wide berth. Usually it is best to tolerate skimmers than to oppose them.

## Structure

The Marsh Skimmers are a loose collective with an informal and fairly flat structure.

Skimmers often join due to debts owed to other skimmers, so there is a degree of fealty in these cases. Otherwise most skimmers have an influential contact that provides them with work and looks after their well-being as best as they can. This leads to cliques that don't interact with or know each other.

Separate common areas represent this isolated group structure. Skimmers will return to their contact's common area to converse with other skimmers, further enforcing this separation.

## Membership

Without a formal membership process or mark, anyone could conceivably join or already be a Marsh Skimmer. This approach is preferable as it makes it harder for authorities to identify members.

Typically new skimmers join out of debt, necessity, or greed.

### Names

Within the Marsh Skimmers, each skimmer is known by a code word name. These are semi-random, have no relation to their real name or person, and are typically assigned by their contact.

These names make it easy for skimmers to hide their true identities, leading to their membership being a form of double-life. Others abandon their original name and go all in.

### Songbirds

The Marsh Skimmers are particularly keen to recruit kenku into their organisation. Kenku with good memories are employed in a special type of role only they could perform.

As Kenku can mimic any sound or voice they have heard, it is possible for them to memorise a full conversation and repeat it word for word. This ability forms a valuable form of communication that can be trusted to be an authentic representation of the conversation. Kenku used in this way are referred to as *songbirds*.

Songbirds are escorted to their destination by other skimmers. On this journey they leave as many responsibilities to the other skimmers as possible, allowing them to focus on preserving the memory they are due to deliver.

Due to the rise of songbirds within the Marsh Skimmers, some guard forces (notably the [Bay Watch](guards/bay-watch.md)) see kenku travelling with others as criminals by default.
