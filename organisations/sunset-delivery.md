## Summary

Sunset Delivery is a private delivery company that exists within the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). It provides postal services for those who can afford it, sending letters and packages to individuals across [South East Kardan](../places/regions/south-east-kardan.md).

Given someone's name and settlement, they are able to deliver to almost anywhere within the kingdom. As this is done by private couriers, sometimes travelling with only your delivery, prices are higher than [Astpost](astorpost.md), and considerably so when delivering off the beaten track.

## Address Format

- Name.
- Street / District / Building (optional).
- Settlement.

Example:

> [Alistair Hawthorn](../characters/alistair-hawthorn.md)  
> 12 [Flute Street](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/flute-street.md)  
> [Goldreach](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/SETTLEMENTS/GOLDREACH/README.md)

## Process

Letters / packages are sent out from the delivery office after a delay of a few days, handed over to a private courier. Sometimes these couriers will be delivering multiple items at once (particularly when travelling to larger settlements, or through others), but they may also be tasked with delivering a single item.

Sometimes couriers aren't able to deliver. They can be killed on the journey, go AWOL, or fail to find the recipient. This usually means the loss of the delivery.
