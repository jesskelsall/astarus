## Beliefs

The Order of the Diamond believes in the four insider [gods](../gods/gods.md) and their teachings. They work together to hold the world in balance. They are treated fairly equally, as four corners of a diamond, though [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md) is given more emphasis as he is a greater deity and head of the pantheon.

The [gods](../gods/gods.md) created [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md), prepared it, and brought the races to it so that they could settle and thrive. Now the [gods](../gods/gods.md) take up more of a “caretaker” role, keeping the forces in balance and avoiding influencing mortal affairs.

## Imagery

### Symbol

The symbol of The Order of the Diamond is a diamond with a cross through its middle. This can be represented as a square-based pyramid, or as a flat plate with the cross etched into it and the symbol of each god placed at each point around the edges.

## Worship

Followers of The Order of the Diamond believe in their [gods](../gods/gods.md) predominantly on faith alone. There is little evidence of the [gods](../gods/gods.md)' power in action outside of anecdotal evidence and the creation myth. As a result there are no mandated activities, and believers are free to worship as much or as little as they desire.

Worship is carried out by each individual in their own way, but is centered around temples where access is possible. This is where all religious ceremonies are held.

### Patrons

Worshippers tend to gravitate towards one particular god. Which one they choose is a personal matter and is entirely their own choice, influenced by their life experiences and desires. They may choose to worship one god exclusively, equally worship all four, or some middle ground in between.

### Religious Days

*See also: [Astorian calendar](../history/astorian-calendar.md)*

Each insider god has its own day of the week and is the traditional day of worship for them. They also have two concurrent calendar months associated with them; there are festivals held when the second of these months ends and the next god's first month begins.

## Temples

The Order of the Diamond constructs temples to the simultaneous worship of all four [gods](../gods/gods.md). They all follow the same basic design guidelines:

- They are diamond shaped from a top-down perspective.
- The entrance is on one of the points of the diamond.
- The entrance has four doors, one for each god, with its symbol displayed above in the canonical order ([Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md), [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md), [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md), [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md)).
- Above the doors is the symbol of the religion - a grey diamond with lines connecting each corner. On larger temples the symbol of each god is placed at one of the corners.
- The interior has shrines to each god depicting their mortal form.
- Shrines are positioned as follows:
  - Center: [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md).
  - Left corner: [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md).
  - Back corner: [Kirrel](../gods/deities/kirrel.md).
  - Right corner: [Gormox](../gods/deities/gormox.md).
- Areas not intended for worshippers are placed on floors above or below the main chamber, accessed via staircases on the back walls.

### Doorways

The four doors are used to display your intention when entering and exiting the temple.

It is customary to both enter and exit through the door of the god for which you have came to worship, doubly so on their religious day. Those who come to worship multiple [gods](../gods/gods.md) will then exit and re-enter through a different door to continue worshipping.

Entering through one door and then exiting through another is considered to be bad luck, as is entering and exiting through doors not associated with the god you are here to worship. This is not strictly enforced, but is frowned upon.

The main exception is when worshipping on festival days that celebrate the changing months. During these ceremonies, it is customary to enter through the door of the outgoing god, and exit through the door of the incoming god.

### Attendants

Those who give their lives to maintaining the temples are called *caretakers*. They are employed by The Order of the Diamond to keep their temple maintained, assist worshippers, and spread the god's teachings.

Typically they live within the temple in basic living quarters, and only leave the temple under extenuating circumstances. This makes them reliant on the community around them to provide their food, drink, and clothing, which the community does as a form of charitable display of devotion.

In temples with multiple caretakers, each caretaker looks after one specific god and dresses in robes displaying that god's colours. In smaller temples, fewer than four caretakers (possibly as few as one) collectively look after the entire temple.

## Tolerance

Worshippers of The Order of the Diamond are typically tolerant of other religious beliefs. They do not actively try to convert non-believers to their faith, but welcome curiosity and those who wish to worship of their own volition.

Those in the military must be practicing members of the religion. However, this is loosely enforced.

## Jurisdiction

The Order of the Diamond is given special powers by the supreme general which allows them to facilitate the religion undisturbed.

### Religious Land

Each temple and the land it is built upon is owned by The Order of the Diamond itself. It exists outside of the usual jurisdictions of Astor. This means that the religion is self regulating and does not answer to anyone else.

### Immunity

The [Astornox](astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](astorrel/astorrel.md) have powers that apply to most parts of the [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). One glaring exception is that of temples. [Astornox](astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](astorrel/astorrel.md) are not allowed to enter temples in a ranked capacity, meaning that they cannot exercise their power or rank inside of a temple.

While inside, all people, citizens or otherwise, are simply worshippers.

### [Sanctuary](astorrel/sanctuary.md)

The Order of the Diamond can take people inside their temples who are wanted by the [Astornox](astornox/astornox.md) or [Astorrel](astorrel/astorrel.md). The caretakers decide how long they may stay, and can forcibly eject anyone overstaying their welcome. It is up to the caretakers to determine how long they may stay.

While here, those seeking [sanctuary](astorrel/sanctuary.md) partake of the food and drink left for the caretakers, and help them with their daily duties.
