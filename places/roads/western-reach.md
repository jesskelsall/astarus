## Summary

The Western Reach is a series of trails that connects [Hyceodd](../settlements/towns/hyceodd.md) and [Blittergate](../settlements/towns/blittergate.md) to the [Neum Flats](../topography/valleys-plains-deserts/neum-flats.md) via [Fort Siloth](../settlements/forts/fort-siloth.md). It extends as far north as [Picdale](../settlements/villages/picdale.md) and the [Tresenda Pass](tresenda-pass.md), but the primary route takes it through [Blittergate](../settlements/towns/blittergate.md) on its way west.

The road is important for its strategic access to the [Neum Flats](../topography/valleys-plains-deserts/neum-flats.md) in defence against aggressors crossing the flats from the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md).
