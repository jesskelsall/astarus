## Summary

The Western Reach is a trail that runs from the [Great Astor Road](great-astor-road.md), just south of [Hyceodd](../settlements/towns/hyceodd.md), to the Neum Flats. It passes through [Blittergate](../settlements/towns/blittergate.md) and allows access to Fort Siloth as part of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)'s defences against incursions from the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md).
