## Summary

Tresenda Pass is a prominent valley stretching from the [Albulain Valley](../topography/valleys-plains-deserts/albulain-valley.md) in the north to [the Western Way](the-western-way.md) in the south. The bulk of the trail known by the same name passes through this valley.

The pass is noteworthy for providing access to the [northern road](northern-road.md) across the [Neum Flats](../topography/valleys-plains-deserts/neum-flats.md) and [Fort Maloja](../settlements/forts/fort-maloja.md) that protects the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) from [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) incursions. During the winter months heavy northerly snowfall makes the 60 mile long valley impassable.

## Description

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Quiet dirt trail along undulating gentle hills. Thick grass, with some trees to the south, but ferns and wildflowers to the north. Set into a bowl shaped valley surrounded by snow topped hills that obscure the sun at sunrise and sunset. Views of the [Foss Peaks](../topography/mountains/foss-peaks.md) to the north. |
| Sounds | Rustling of grass, birds, wolves howling in the night. |
| Smells | Fresh air. |
| People | Almost entirely devoid of travellers. [Astornox](../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) if any. |
| Intrigue | A picturesque travel route that is more dangerous than it looks. |
