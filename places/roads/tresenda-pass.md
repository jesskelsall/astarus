## Summary

Tresenda Pass is a mountain pass that stretches from Fort Maloja in the north to [Blittergate](../settlements/towns/blittergate.md) in the south, notorious for its wolves and impassibility during the winter months.

The name "Tresenda Pass" can be used to both refer to the road and the valley that the road passes through along its middle. The mountain pass itself is 60 miles in length.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Quiet dirt trail along undulating gentle hills. Thick grass, with some trees to the south, but ferns and wildflowers to the north. Set into a bowl shaped valley surrounded by snow topped hills that obscure the sun at sunrise and sunset. Views of the [Foss Peaks](../topography/mountains/foss-peaks.md) to the north. |
| Sounds | Rustling of grass, birds, wolves howling in the night. |
| Smells | Fresh air. |
| People | Almost entirely devoid of travellers. [Astornox](../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) if any. |
| Intrigue | A picturesque travel route that is more dangerous than it looks. |
