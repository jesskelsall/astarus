## Summary

Astor's eastern coast is dominated by rough hills and steep cliffs, making travel off the [Great Astor Road](../roads/great-astor-road.md) treacherous. What little usable land there is is squeezed between the [Sea of Songs](../seas/sea-of-songs.md) and the [Knock Peaks](../mountains/knock-peaks.md). The fishing port of [Dunmore](../cities/dunmore.md) dominates this region.
