## Summary

Western Astor is mountainous and riddled with hills, making getting around difficult. The roads here aren't very well developed, so the communities tend to keep to themselves and are largely self-sufficient. The [Great Astor Road](../roads/great-astor-road.md) passes through via [Hyceodd](../towns/hyceodd.md), connecting it to the rest of the kingdom outside of the winter months, when the snowfall in the north west is too thick for travel.
