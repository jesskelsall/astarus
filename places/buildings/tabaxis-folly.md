## Summary

*See: [Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md)*

Tabaxi's Folly is the headquarters of the [Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md). A series of underground tunnels and chambers built under most of the city of [Murkwallow](../settlements/cities/murkwallow.md).

### Exterior

Entry is made by hidden doors set into the cobblestone under various canal bridges around the city. Certain stones can be depressed to open a cobbled doorway, revealing dark and claustrophobic tunnels that lead to a central area.

### Interior

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Pitch black narrow & squat maze of tunnels navigating the entire city. Large central chamber, a 10ft high stone cavern containing wooden benches and a canteen serving food. Candles on each table provide lighting. Wooden doors around edges lead to isolated bars. |
| Sounds | Distant howl of wind, water drips, coughing. |
| Smells | Stale water, stone, candle wax. |
| People | [Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/criminals/marsh-skimmers.md) minding their own business. |
| Intrigue | A subterranean network of tunnels under a city supposedly too muddy for heavy or deep foundations. |
