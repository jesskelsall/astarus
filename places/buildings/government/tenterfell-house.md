## Description

### Exterior

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Down a narrow side alley from the stronghold's street. Regular stone exterior with roughly finished facade. Tall narrow windows on all 3 floors. Regular sized entry door made of immaculate dark wood and finished in wrought iron, with a large lock and sliding bolt across the entire door. |
| Sounds | Pigeons on the ledges. |
| Smells | Mildew. Faint smell of sewer manhole nearby. |
| People | Occasional [Astorrel](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) with specific need to be here. |
| Intrigue | Off the beaten path and less polished & affluent than the main street. Easily overlooked. |

### Interior - Ground Floor

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Small dark wood panelled lobby with reception desk to the right. Square staircase to the left with views up to a glass skylight on the roof. |
| Sounds | Pages turning, occasional cough. |
| Smells | Dust, musty wood. |
| People | [Astorrel member](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) working the front desk. Indifferent to people who commonly come and go. |
| Intrigue | Looks old fashioned compared to the other buildings in the stronghold that have seen revisions over time. |

### Interior - Ground Floor

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Large rectangular space with rows of wooden desks. Raw wooden floorboards full of knots. Dim lightning through a few small windows on the back and right walls. Brick wall on left with four doors, each leading into individual offices. Offices with nicer desk, bookcase, four chairs, diagonal skylight of frosted glass. |
| Sounds | Quill scribbling, shifting papers, creaking floorboards. Quiet chatter. |
| Smells | Body odour, paper, ink. |
| People | [Astorrel members](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) writing documents. |
| Intrigue | Resembles an early 20th century office. |

### Interior - Third Floor

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Half floor with rooftop terrace occupying the other half. Bare stone open plan room with dark oak floorboards. 8 person table sits in the middle with chairs, acting as the war table or dining table as needed. 2 old couches lined up along one wall. Back corner has 2x L-shaped old wooden desks. One used by [Tyburn Dalvos](../../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md): large shallow bowl of water, scattered notebooks and papers. One used by [Elysia Vanderboss](../../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md). |
| Sounds | Pigeons on the roof. Creaky floorboards. |
| Smells | Dust, stone, mould. |
| People | |
| Intrigue | Surprisingly spacious but borderline derelict space, enough for 2 squads to at least exist. |

## History

While the [Astral Squad](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) gained the use of Tenterfell House's third floor, using it as a base of operations. Here the squad could discuss in secret their private efforts to investigate the meteoric threat.

When Elysia was promoted to [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) under the Major of Phenomena [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../../../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md), he noticed Elysia's affinity for the building, taking it over entirely for other Phenomena operations. The squads under her command continue to operate out of its third floor.
