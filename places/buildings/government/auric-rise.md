## Summary

Auric Rise is a dual purpose accommodation and office building for [Astorrel](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) officers in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../settlements/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) in [Northhaven](../../settlements/cities/northhaven.md).

It provides the officers who live there easy access to the amenities of the stronghold, adjacency to their superiors, an office from which to conduct their work, and a clear place for their subordinates to meet them.

The building is laid out like a hotel, with a lobby on the ground floor that is staffed by [Astorrel Members](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md). They ensure that those entering Auric Rise have an invitation, and verify it with those they are visiting before granting them access.
