## Summary

Rhotrukk Wepons (sic) is a weaponsmith on [Crafters Course](../../streets/crafters-course.md) in the [Sunset District](../../districts/sunset-district.md) of [Northhaven](../../cities/northhaven.md).

It is ran by [Rhotrukk Bone Bleeder](../../../characters/rhotrukk-bone-bleeder.md). He works all day churning out weapons as he pleases, and offers them for sale at whatever he considers a fair price at a glance.

On the outside, the sign is a large and long plank of wood that has been crudely painted with red paint and is misspelled. Nobody comments on it. There are small windows with iron bars on them.

Inside there is a blacksmith's forge where Rhotrukk can be found working. The rest of the shop is metal racks against the walls and in the middle, filled with weapons haphazardly and with no logical order. 

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Crudely painted rough wooden sign, misspelled. Two small windows either side of the door, barred. Inside, a forge at the back currently running. Metal weapon racks on all walls and in the middle, filled randomly with all sorts. |
| Sounds | Forge running. Heavy rhythmic hammer banging. Metal on metal as swords are moved in racks. |
| Smells | Coal. |
| People | Customers browsing, pulling weapons out of the racks before putting them back. |
| Intrigue | It's a wonder anyone can find anything here, or that Rhotrukk makes any money with his carefree attitude. Despite this, his weapons are high quality. |

## Vendor

- Armor (PHB p149).

[Players](../../../../players/logan.md) must roll to see if they can find the weapon(s) they want:

| DC | Result |
|:---:| --- |
| 1-5 | That item isn't in stock. |
| 6-10 | Found after 10 minutes of searching. |
| 11-19 | Found after a few moments. |
| 20 | Found instantly, alongside another player's item. |

Alternatively Rhotrukk can be convinced to stop working to help search through his madness on a DC 12 persuasion check.

Rhotrukk can also be requested to make a standard weapon on a DC 15 persuasion check. It will be ready the following morning.

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/astorrel-agents.md)

Rhotrukk is working away at his forge as usual, unaware or unbothered by the increasing interest in his wares today.
