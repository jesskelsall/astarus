## Summary

Grizgrep Reagents & Magical Curios is a shop that specialises in selling magical reagents needed for spell material components. It is located on [Crafters Course](../../settlements/streets/crafters-course.md) in the [Sunset District](../../settlements/districts/sunset-district.md) of [Northhaven](../../settlements/cities/northhaven.md).

A delicately decorated sign hangs above the shop, taking up its entire length. There is also a folding chalkboard that lists a bunch of magical components in different coloured chalks:

- Sulfur
- Grasshopper legs
- Holy water
- Silver wire
- Legume seeds

Inside are large barrels of components, each containing ladles for measuring quantities. At the back is a counter with several sets of scales. The room is garishly decorated in paneling painted in clashing colours.

## Description
