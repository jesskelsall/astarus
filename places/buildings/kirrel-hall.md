## Summary

Kirrel Hall is a banquet hall in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) in [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md).

It is a general meeting place used for ceremonies, hosting distinguished guests, feasts and celebrations, and general socialising. In the summer months it sees little use outside of ceremonies and festivals, but in the winter months it is transformed into a warm communal gathering place.

It resembles a church or cathedral in design - one long tall chamber supported by pillars on either sides, with a vaulted roof. The interior is built with white marble pillars and decorations. It has a sloped roof and stained glass windows.

The entrance is on its side near the end. When entering, the room opens out to the left.

| Sights | Stone church-like exterior with stained glass windows, sloped roof, and decorative embellishments. Inside is decorated in white marble. Large pillars run the length of the hall, holding the vaulted roof up. Polished stone floor. Marble decoration. |
| Sounds | Echoing footsteps. |
| Smells | Candle wax, dust. |
| People | [Astorrel Members](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) preparing the hall for its next use, or cleaning up. |
| Intrigue | The hall shows a strong sense of community within the [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md), and almost appears to be a form of self-worship. |
