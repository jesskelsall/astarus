## Summary

*See: [Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md)*

The Fox Hole is the headquarters of [Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md). A large lodge providing a social space and accommodation to family members between their adventures.

Entry is limited to [Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members who have either a [Coin of Family](../../items/coins/coin-of-family.md) or a [Coin of Friendship](../../items/coins/coin-of-friendship.md), making it a haven to like-minded adventurers that want to rest, share a story, and look for their next challenge.

The viking-style lodge sits at the top of [Trest](../towns/trest.md), overlooking the town from its crested hill top. It is the most recognisable building in [Trest](../towns/trest.md) and easy to see from both the [Trest Marketplace](../structures/trest-marketplace.md) and various alleys throughout the town.

### Interior

| Sights | Long room with vaulted wooden ceiling, dramatically showing off the room's size. Blazing stone encased fireplace opposite the door. Huge long wooden dining table along the full length, with a single large golden cloth running along its middle. Giant banners hanging from the rafters at each end: [Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) to the left, [Nilus Coast](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/nilus-coast.md) to the right. Dual staircases at each end lead deeper to the kitchens and bunks. |
| Sounds | Jovial conversation, cheering, music playing and singing, clanking of mugs, food being eaten. |
| Smells | Fresh baked bread, meats, fruit. Body odour, smoke from the fireplace. |
| People | [Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) members. Mother of the House. Cooks and assistants coming and going from downstairs. |
