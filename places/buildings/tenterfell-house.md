## Summary

### Exterior

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Down a narrow side alley from the stronghold's street. Regular stone exterior with roughly finished facade. Tall narrow windows on all 3 floors. Regular sized entry door made of immaculate dark wood and finished in wrought iron, with a large lock and sliding bolt across the entire door. |
| Sounds | Pigeons on the ledges. |
| Smells | Mildew. Faint smell of sewer manhole nearby. |
| People | Occasional [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) with specific need to be here. |
| Intrigue | Off the beaten path and less polished & affluent than the main street. Easily overlooked. |

### Interior - Ground Floor

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Small dark wood panelled lobby with reception desk to the right. Square staircase to the left with views up to a glass skylight on the roof. |
| Sounds | Pages turning, occasional cough. |
| Smells | Dust, musty wood. |
| People | [Astorrel member](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) working the front desk. Indifferent to people who commonly come and go. |
| Intrigue | Looks old fashioned compared to the other buildings in the stronghold that have seen revisions over time. |

### Interior - Third Floor

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Half floor with rooftop terrace occupying the other half. Bare stone open plan room with dark oak floorboards. 8 person table sits in the middle with chairs, acting as the war table or dining table as needed. 2 old couches lined up along one wall. Back corner has 2x L-shaped old wooden desks. One used by [Tyburn Dalvos](../../characters/tyburn-dalvos.md): large shallow bowl of water, scattered notebooks and papers. One used by [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md). |
| Sounds | Pigeons on the roof. Creaky floorboards. |
| Smells | Dust, stone, mould. |
| People | |
| Intrigue | Surprisingly spacious but borderline derelict space, enough for 2 squads to at least exist. |

## History

While the [Astral Squad](../../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) [Astorrel Squad Hand](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-hand.md), [Elysia Vanderboss](../../characters/elysia-vanderboss.md) gained the use of Tenterfell House's third floor, using it as a base of operations. Here the squad could discuss in secret their private efforts to investigate the meteoric threat.

When Elysia was promoted to [Astorrel Squad Sergeant](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-squad-sergeant.md) under the Major of Phenomena [Quinn Mac Domhnail](../../characters/quinn-mac-domhnail.md), he noticed Elysia's affinity for the building, taking it over entirely for other Phenomena operations. The squads under her command continue to operate out of its third floor.
