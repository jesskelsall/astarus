## Summary

The Brew's Lair is both the brewery and flagship inn for [Dragonbrew](../../../organisations/business/dragonbrew.md). Its large drinking room is known for its separated tables, quiet atmosphere, but most notably - its white dragon skeleton suspended from the ceiling.

The brewery is located beneath the main chamber.

## Dragon Tables

The four coloured (black, red, green, blue) tables in the middle of the room are reserved for the associated colour of chromatic dragon. As long as one of the six chairs at each table is free, that colour of dragonborn can take a seat and enjoy as many ales of that type as they'd like for half price.

It is an unspoken rule that no other ale can be ordered while sat there, and that only those four colours of dragonborn are allowed to approach the centre tables (except for bar staff).

## Dragon Skeleton

The adult white dragon hanging from the ceiling was Soindynth. It was slain in what is now Drachbarn by groups of dwarves and dragonborn working together to open up northern routes, particularly to what would become the [Dardenn Kingdom](../../../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md).

Lachunkulic Vyre's ancestor was present for the dragon's death. His son would use his father's claim to trade for parts of the dragon's bones, spending his entire life and great expense completing the skeleton.
