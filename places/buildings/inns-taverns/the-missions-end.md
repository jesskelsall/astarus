## Summary

The Mission's End is an inn inside of the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../../settlements/strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) in [Northhaven](../../settlements/cities/northhaven.md).

It is a combination of an inn and a hostel, designed for [Astorrel](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) turning around between missions. It offers an all inclusive food, drink, and lodging package only, simplifying the inn process. Every room contains two bunk beds, meaning that those without a full party may have to share with strangers.

From the outside it resembles many of the other buildings in [Northhaven](../../settlements/cities/northhaven.md): built of polished stone and decorated in marble. It has marble pillars surrounding its outside, connected to a sloped roof around its edges. The building is long and wide, with a square courtyard in its center accessible from the hallways that border it.

Inside the entryway is a large canteen-like room that takes up half of the ground floor. There is a kitchen hatch where meals are served at all hours, and rows of benches & tables to sit at.

Payment is taken at the doorway and a room key is given. This is then presented to reenter the building without having to pay again. Each room has four identical keys, one for each person staying in it.
