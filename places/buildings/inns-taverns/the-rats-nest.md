### Interior

| Sensation | Description |

| Sounds | Patrons chatting, mugs on tables. |
| Smells | Ale, wet wood, dogs, dirt. |
| People | Commoners, [Astornox guards](../../../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) enjoying a drink but keeping an eye out. |
| Intrigue | Not comment worthy... |

### Basement

| Sensation | Description |

| Sounds | Virtually silent - patrons trying to keep the bar's presence secret. |
| Smells | Lantern oil, sweat, dried blood. |
