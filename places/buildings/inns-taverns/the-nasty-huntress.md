| Sights | Cobbled stone building with thatched roof, L-shaped on the corner of an intersection by the village's small centre.<br>Unsuspecting wooden door visible from the road. Wooden board sign nailed to the side of the building near the door. |
| Sounds | Vigorous baking from the kitchen beyond the door. |
| Smells | Baking. |
| People | Lower class villagers, overwhelmingly locals. |
| Intrigue | A standard looking house that appears to be an inn. |

### Interior

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Enter directly into the kitchen. Deep kiln to the left, thick wooden bench / cutting surface in the middle of the room. Supplies and storage to the back. Evidence of dough rising and recent baking.<br>Door hole to the right leading into a converted living room, now the tavern. Two 4-seater tables, one two-seater table. Step up into the room. Windows overlooking the street. Crude artwork of local scenery and farming equipment on the wall backing onto the kitchen.<br>Staircase leading upstairs at the back of the tavern room. Two rooms available plus one for Askad. |

| People | Rare patrons stopping by for a quiet drink. |
| Intrigue | A cramped but homely inn, every inch of space put to use in service of paying customers. |
