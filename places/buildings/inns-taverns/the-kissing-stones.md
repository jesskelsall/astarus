## Summary

The Kissing Stones is the only inn in [Filisur](../../villages/filisur.md)'s village centre. It is named for the uniquely shaped stile on the wall out front, a remnant from before the village centre was built.

Its interior is inspired by Japanese [Izakaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izakaya) alley restaurants.

### History

While [Arnel Levat](../../../characters/arnel-levat.md) is the owner, he is not a citizen of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), not having served in the military. He and the [Astornox](../../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) stationed at Fort Maloja have an unspoken agreement that he may operate the business as if he owned it, providing he passes stories of potential unrest onto them.
