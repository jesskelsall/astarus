## Summary

The Greedy Trout is the only inn in [Frizthwaite](../../villages/frizthwaite.md). It is owned and ran by [Mordus Shren](../../../characters/mordus-shren.md).

### Exterior

Typical cobbled stone and wooden building, set over 2 storeys. Stable round the back. Wrought iron hanging sign out front makes it easier to find.

### Interior

Inside the tavern area is set over 2 floors. On the ground floor is the bar and main seating area, underneath the second floor mezzanine. Behind the bar is the kitchen and living quarters for the Shren family.

Upstairs is accessed by a staircase in a side corridor which then emerges to the mezzanine area. Here people are also drinking, but it is a more relaxed atmosphere.

Further along the corridor are the rooms for rent.

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md)

If the party decides to stay here overnight following their battle with [The Crimson Blades](../../../organisations/the-crimson-blades.md), they will encounter no notoriety.

However, in the morning the [Astornox](../../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) from [Beckermet](../../towns/beckermet.md) will arrive and insist on searching the inn for them.
