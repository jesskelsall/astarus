## Summary

Gate to the West is a military inn in [Blittergate](../../towns/blittergate.md). It caters exclusively to [Astornox](../../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md), particularly those who are travelling on to the furthest extent of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)'s territories.

It is a popular spot for roaming military members such as [Astorrel](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) squads and [Astornox magicborn hunters](../../../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-magicborn-hunter.md).

### Exterior

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Two storey cobbled stone building with vaulted thatched roof. Wooden door and small windows. Wooden awning to protect patrons from the rain while entering/leaving. Two banners either side of the door: brown with the [Astornox](../../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) symbol, turquoise with the [Astorrel](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) symbol, both with the inn's name painted in white above and below. |
| Sounds | Quiet sounds of patrons inside. |
| Smells | Cooked meat and root vegetables, faint smell of ale. |
| People | Local [Astornox guards](../../../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) coming and going. |
| Intrigue | An exclusive club for military members, but in the most unlikely of places. |

### Interior

Typical inn with rooms upstairs.

## Host System

Gate to the West has no official owner and is therefore self organising. Technically speaking the Captain of [Blittergate](../../towns/blittergate.md) owns the building and business, but this is entirely for administrative purposes.

Instead, a military member volunteers to run the inn, a role referred to as "host". Anyone can relieve the existing host of their role, taking over their duties for as long as they wish. In the event that the current host leaves, the [Blittergate](../../towns/blittergate.md) [Astornox](../../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) choose a local [Astornox](../../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) member for the time being.

The host runs all aspects of the inn except for the kitchen. They are responsible for checking guests' [military badges](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md), taking and fulfilling orders, and generally being sociable to the inn's patrons.

During this time the host gets free accommodation, food, and drink as compensation.

Typically the role is filled by someone who is between jobs or has time to spare before reporting in again. Many hosts find the simplicity and peace of [Blittergate](../../towns/blittergate.md) makes a welcome change from their typical responsibilities.
