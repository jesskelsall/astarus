## Summary

### Exterior

*See: [Arnaside](../../settlements/villages/arnaside.md)*

Looks just like all of the other buildings in [Arnaside](../../settlements/villages/arnaside.md).

### Interior

The interior resembles a wooden beamed and paneled tavern, though the quality of the woodworking is lower than usual. Has a bar and 4 rectangular tables with stools. Very little to be seen behind the bar.

Typically the bar has a few patrons. It closes once it gets dark.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Low ceiling. Wooden beams and center supports. Roughly constructed bar, 4 tables, stools. Little visible stock behind the bar. Fireplace in the far end. |
| Sounds | Wind howling against the roof, creaking wood. Quiet chatter when patrons are in. |
| Smells | Peat, wet wood. |
| People | Drigg patrons enjoying a quiet drink and a chat. |
| Intrigue | The closest thing [Arnaside](../../settlements/villages/arnaside.md) has to a modern village, though the tavern isn't up to any reasonable standard. |

## Places

## Vendor

No beer is available. Sheep milk and water is however.

[Arnaside](../../settlements/villages/arnaside.md) doesn't use coin, so offers to pay are seen as strange.
