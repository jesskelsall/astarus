## Summary

TODO

The Sanctum is the building in the [Northhaven Astorrel Stronghold](../strongholds/northhaven-astorrel-stronghold.md) in which the stronghold's sanctuaries are located. [Astorrel Guard Sergeants](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) that offer [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) look after those offered [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) here.

### Exterior

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | 4 storey building made of grey polished stone. Sparsely decorated. Segmented windows on both sides of the front on each floor. Regular wooden door forms an unassuming entrance. Sloped tiled roof. |
| Sounds | Birds perched on the roof. |
| Smells | Pleasant street smells. |
| People | [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) visitors only. |
| Intrigue | An unassuming building right next to the stronghold's gatehouse. |

### Ground Floor

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Large entrance area stretching forward the length of the right side of the building, with a desk on its left wall. Closed large wooden chests along the right wall. Wooden segregated stalls with roped curtains form changing stalls containing [Astorrel robes](../../organisations/astorrel/uniforms/astorrel-robes.md) ([sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md)). Hallway to the left with the staircase against the front wall. Second locked room used for storage. Grey polished stone floor with refined wooden walls and decor. Simpler than most [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) buildings. |
| Sounds | None |
| Smells | Leathers and fabrics. Slight smell of dust. |
| People | [Astorrel Member](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) working at the desk if anyone is [receiving sanctuary](../../storylines/receiving-sanctuary.md). |
| Intrigue | Clearly set up specifically for the purpose of getting people to part with their possessions and store them away for safe keeping. |

### [Sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) Floors

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Inset area with a chair and two doors. Left door is a storage closet. Right door leads into airlock corridor round to the left. Can't get further without closing that door. Second door leads into living room with soft matted flooring, a coffee table, and a cupboard room containing futons. Two narrow windows look out over the stronghold wall or [Astor Square](../structures/astor-square.md). Another door leads to the bathroom. Granite wall and floor, self standing wooden bathtub, polished stone sink and toilet, all with taps and drainage. Bell system connects two bells inside and out of the [sanctuary](../../organisations/astorrel/sanctuary.md) near the living room door and the outer storage closet. |
| Sounds | Movement on the stairs, muffled conversations below. Bells ringing gently. |
| Smells | Body odour, clean water. That day's food. |
| People | [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) and visitors only. |
| Intrigue | Similar to a Japanese ryokan but without the freedom of movement. |

## History

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain.md)

The Sanctum is completely empty when the party arrive. An [Astorrel Member](../../organisations/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) is fetched by [Garrick Rose](../../characters/garrick-rose.md)'s other guard to check the party in, recording their names in a large tome.

Date: Nurdag, 5th of Finsbock.

The party is asked to place their belongings in the chests provided and go into the stalls to change into the robes provided. They may then pick one item each which [Garrick Rose](../../characters/garrick-rose.md) will inspect, potentially refusing. The party is then taken upstairs.

[Garrick Rose](../../characters/garrick-rose.md) opens the doors while his guards keep watch. The bell system is explained and its usage, then the party enter one by one before they are locked inside.
