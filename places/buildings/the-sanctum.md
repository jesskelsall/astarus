[Astorrel Guard Sergeants](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) that offer [sanctuary](../../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) look after those offered [sanctuary](../../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) here.

### Ground Floor

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Large entrance area stretching forward the length of the right side of the building, with a desk on its left wall. Closed large wooden chests along the right wall. Wooden segregated stalls with roped curtains form changing stalls containing [Astorrel robes](../../organisations/government/astorrel/uniforms/astorrel-robes.md) ([sanctuary](../../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md)). Hallway to the left with the staircase against the front wall. Second locked room used for storage. Grey polished stone floor with refined wooden walls and decor. Simpler than most [Astorrel](../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) buildings. |
| Sounds | None |
| Smells | Leathers and fabrics. Slight smell of dust. |
| People | [Astorrel Member](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-member.md) working at the desk if anyone is [receiving sanctuary](../../storylines/ended/receiving-sanctuary.md). |
| Intrigue | Clearly set up specifically for the purpose of getting people to part with their possessions and store them away for safe keeping. |

### [Sanctuary](../../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) Floors

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Inset area with a chair and two doors. Left door is a storage closet. Right door leads into airlock corridor round to the left. Can't get further without closing that door. Second door leads into living room with soft matted flooring, a coffee table, and a cupboard room containing futons. Two narrow windows look out over the stronghold wall or [Astor Square](../structures/astor-square.md). Another door leads to the bathroom. Granite wall and floor, self standing wooden bathtub, polished stone sink and toilet, all with taps and drainage. Bell system connects two bells inside and out of the [sanctuary](../../organisations/government/astorrel/sanctuary.md) near the living room door and the outer storage closet. |
| Sounds | Movement on the stairs, muffled conversations below. Bells ringing gently. |
| Smells | Body odour, clean water. That day's food. |
| People | [Astorrel Guard Sergeant](../../organisations/government/astorrel/ranks/astorrel-guard-sergeant.md) and visitors only. |
| Intrigue | Similar to a Japanese ryokan but without the freedom of movement. |
