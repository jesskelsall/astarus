## Summary

Humouth Lighthouse is a lighthouse that helps ships navigate their way between the [Sea of Songs](../topography/seas-oceans/sea-of-songs.md) and the [River Humar](../topography/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), around the Humar Estuary.

It is a typical lighthouse design in plain white. A slightly tapered cylinder of cobbled stone, painted white but stripped on its east side due to the wind. The lamp deck is enclosed, with a magical light source on the inside acting as a beacon during the night hours.

At its base the tower rises out of a cobbled building which is 2 storeys tall, painted completely white except for its roof.
