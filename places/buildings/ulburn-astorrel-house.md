## Summary

Ulburn Astorrel House is an [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) building in [Ulburn](../villages/ulburn.md) that [Goshawk Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/goshawk-squad.md) and [Spoor Squad](../../organisations/astorrel/squads/spoor-squad.md) operate out of. From here they work together to ensure that the recent growth of [Ulburn](../villages/ulburn.md) isn't having too great an effect on the surrounding ecology.

It is located near the centre of the village, prominently placed for ease of access.

### Exterior
