Stack of logs near the front door. |
| Sounds | Fluttering of cloth, wind blowing through grass, sheep. |
| Smells | Grass, sheep droppings. |
| People | Trint family, sheepdogs. |
| Intrigue | A humble farmstead for raising sheep. Lots of cloth. |

### Interior

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Candle-lit rustic interior with small kitchen, focused around a thin wood dining table. Hearth with cooking pots, always lit to provide heat. Curing meat and root vegetables hanging from the rafters near the edges of the room.<br>Wooden partition into another room containing a large wooden loom, piles of sheep's wool, and barrels for dying cloth.<br>Master bedroom beyond another wooden partition through the loom room. |
| Sounds | Creaking of wooden beams in the wind. Crackle of the fire. Loom moving rhythmically. |
| Smells | Cooking mutton, baking bread. Urine and wool. |
| People | |
| Intrigue | A cosy but cramped interior that maximises storage space and heat retention. Producing wool takes up a lot of the potential living space. |
