## Summary

Raine's Cottage is the home of [Raine Soulier](../../../characters/raine-soulier.md). It is a stone cottage built on the hills overlooking [Lake Gondra](../../topography/rivers-lakes/lake-gondra.md), trying its best to emulate the look and feel of the [Soulier Cottage](soulier-cottage.md).

From here Raine lives in relative isolation, enjoying the solitude and opportunity to perform their research on magical artifacts away from the noise of a settlement.

### Exterior

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Drab cobbled stone long rectangular building with wooden vaulted roof. Wooden front door on end. Unremarkable surrounding terrain - patchy grass, goats and sheep.

| Sounds | Wind, rustling grass, goats. |
| Smells | Grass, faint flowers. |
| People | |
| Intrigue | A fairly dull cottage with a view that most can only dream to afford. |

### Interior

| Sounds | Wind howling through rafters. Cracking fireplace. |
| Smells | Stale air, sweat, rotting wood. |
