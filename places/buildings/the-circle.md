## Summary

The Circle is the chamber in which [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) trials take place. It is located somewhere inside the [Northhaven Astornar Stronghold](../strongholds/northhaven-astornar-stronghold.md), seemingly only accessible by teleportation.

### Interior

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Large circular room with tall walls and domed roof with round glass covered skylight. Highly polished grey stone surfaces with minimal detail, reflects light well. Two rows of grey stone pews with an aisle down the middle. Teleportation circle at the back of the room, made of gold inlaid into the floor, arcane runes between two circles. 10ft wide. Raised section for [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) Generals to sit in, 3/4 of the way up the wall on the far end. Pedestal in the centre of that for the General Supreme to sit and preside. Door behind that. |
| Sounds | Hushed voices echoing around the room. |
| Smells | None. |
| People | [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) Generals, [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md)/[Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) higher ups. |
| Intrigue | No obvious entrance or exit aside from the teleportation circle. |
