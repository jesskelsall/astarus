## Summary

Hyceodd is a port town along the [Great Astor Road](../roads/great-astor-road.md), the only settlement between [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) and [Yeatscale](../cities/yeatscale.md). A strategic position where the [River Carn](../rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) meets the [Carneid Inlet](../seas-oceans/carneid-inlet.md), Hyceodd's tall walls and large harbour hint at its prior strategic role in the Astor-Syntenne War.

These days Hyceodd is increasingly cosmopolitan due to being a destination for immigrants coming from the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) and the [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Town on flat grassland next to the river, surrounded with tall stone walls. Wall perimeter is wide and narrow, creating a wall against the south. Adjoined large harbour, mostly empty except for trade ships. Gridded street layout with 2 and 3 storey medieval buildings. Prominent central temple with a marketplace completely surrounding it. [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) stronghold surrounded by similarly tall walls. |
| Sounds | Chatter, trade, dogs barking, children playing, pigeons. |
| Smells | Fish, excrement, fresh produce. |
| People | Incredibly varied mix of races. Predominantly poor. |
| Intrigue | A once essential port town is now home to those without their own. |
