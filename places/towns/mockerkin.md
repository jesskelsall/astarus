## Summary

Mockerkin is a town in [eastern Astor](../regions/eastern-astor.md).

It is nestled near the base of the Bray mountains, which loom over it to the north. To the east is the [river Esk](../rivers-lakes/river-esk.md), and to the west is the Braywood.

Despite the potentially idyllic setting, Mockerkin is a mining town which makes its money from mining precious metals, gems, and marble, all of which are exported down the river to [Eskrigg](../cities/eskrigg.md), or further to [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) via the [Sea of Songs](../seas/sea-of-songs.md) and the [river Humar](../rivers-lakes/river-humar.md).

There is an active pit fighting scene in Mockerkin, giving the workers an opportunity to show off their strength cultivated in the mines and blow off some steam. As a result, pit fighters from Mockerkin are held in the highest regard.
