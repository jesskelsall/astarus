## Summary

Côtedouce is a coastal town of [Reimatelau](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md) located at the intersection of the Kas'ran Desert, the Reime Jungle, and the Kavallos Sea.

The gateway to the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) from the [Syntenne Republic](../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md), the town has guards from both civilisations working together to enforce the safety of the border. The most southern [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) port, it is often the target of [Kavallos Fleet](../../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) raids.

*Côtedouce* comes from the French (elvish) *côte douce*, meaning *gentle coast*.
