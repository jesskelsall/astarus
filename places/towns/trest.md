## Summary

The second settlement along the [Nilus Coast](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/nilus-coast.md) after the capital city of [Starnov](../cities/starnov.md), Trest is a busy trade town with a vibrant market. While it has an active harbour, most of its trade comes from over-land trade along the [Nilus Coast](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/nilus-coast.md) itself, supporting the settlements to the west.

[Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) was founded and are still headquartered in Trest.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Town on a consistently sloping hill. Multi-storey buildings with maze-like narrow cobbled streets between. Drainage channels cut down every street to help the water flow during rainy days. Bunting in turquoise and gold criss-crosses many streets. Large main road cuts town in half east to west. Views of the [Nilus Peaks](../mountains/nilus-peaks.md) to the north, [Gulf of Tanelle](../seas-oceans/gulf-of-tanelle.md) to the south. |
| Sounds | Hustle bustle of daily life. Horses and carts. Merchants trading. Pigeons. Children playing in [the alleys](../buildings/shops/the-alley.md). |
| Smells | Salt air, mossy cobble, fresh bread, bird poop. |
| People | Lower to middle class citizens, merchants, [Coastguard](../../organisations/guards/coastguard.md). |
| Intrigue | A humble trading town along a well travelled route. |
