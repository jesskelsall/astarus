## Summary

The second settlement along the [Nilus Coast](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/nilus-coast.md) after the capital city of [Starnov](../cities/starnov.md), Trest is a busy trade town with a vibrant market. While it has an active harbour, most of its trade comes from over-land trade along the [Nilus Coast](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/nilus-coast.md) itself, supporting the settlements to the west.

[Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) was founded and are still headquartered in Trest.
