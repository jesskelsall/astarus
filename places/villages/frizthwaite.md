## Summary

Frizthwaite is a village on the [River Humar](../rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) in [Northern Astor](../regions/northern-astor.md).

It is situated on the north bank of the river and is not easily accessible by road, though the journey from the [Northern Road](../roads/northern-road.md) is not particularly difficult.

The waters here are slow and lend themselves to river fishing, the village's main export. Many of the villagers are experts in fishing and using boats in the river's currents, making them adept at moving goods up and down the river, as far south as [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md).

The village itself is tightly packed against the river's edge, with many piers and boats roped to them. The main dirt street runs along the riverside. Here the market stalls sell fresh fish from the river, as well as other wares imported from down river.

## Planning

### [Purple Rain](../../campaigns/purple-rain.md)

The village is going about their usual business, blissfully unaware of the party on the run from the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) visit the town every few days from [Beckermet](../towns/beckermet.md). Today they're not here, having visited yesterday.

[Oleg Purley](../../characters/oleg-purley.md) is standing around by the riverside and is able to help the party procure a boat.
