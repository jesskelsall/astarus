## Summary

Allonby is a village in [Central Astor](../regions/central-astor.md), found along the [Coastal Trail](../roads/coastal-trail.md).

It is built into the side of a natural depression near the cliff side. Most of the buildings are carved directly into the land here, forming a 3 storey circle bordered by buildings set directly into the cliffs, around 100ft across. Separate buildings on each floor are accessed by stone stairs cut into the top of the building below. Several moderate gulleys are used in the same way as streets.

Others make their homes in cobbled stone houses built on top of the cliffs, forming a fourth layer. These houses are more exposed to the elements, and have grass on their roofs.

Amongst the safety of the cliffs, cattle is able to shelter from the elements when the wind is at its strongest. Here the villagers congregate for events and socialising, and children can be found playing.

Above the cliffs, cattle graze on the grass when the weather allows it. Farmers grow root vegetables in large quantities to sustain the village, and for export.

## History

## Planning

### [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents/astorrel-agents.md)

The [players](../../../players/logan.md) may pass through here during either heavy wind or calmer times.

Allonby is very welcoming and curious about the party, offering them food. There is no inn, but a building can be cleared to host them overnight.

Two [Astornox guards](../../organisations/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) are currently in Allonby on village patrol. They will be helping out here for at least 3 more days before heading back to [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md).
