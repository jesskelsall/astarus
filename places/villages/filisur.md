## Summary

Filisur is a small village nestled in the Albulain Valley, home to the [cepine](../../lineages/cepine.md) people.

It is the furthest north west settlement in the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) and the penultimate stop along the [Tresenda Pass](../roads/tresenda-pass.md) roads before the Neum Flats, only separated by Fort Maloja.

The people of Filisur lead a simple shepherding life, raising sheep in the spring and summer before hunkering down through the cold and snowy autumn and winter. Life here is beholden to the seasons and only exists due to the green sloping hills that sustain the flocks.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Cobbled stone farmsteads spread evenly between. Cobbled walls criss-crossing the landscape, keeping in sheep. Smaller fields growing root vegetables and some grains. Dirt roads between the walls. Wooden gates and crumbling infrastructure. No sort of village centre - non-nuclear layout. Some trees between fields, more further out. |
| Sounds | Sheep bleating, sheepdogs barking. Birds in the trees. |
| Smells | Grass, flowers. |
| People | [Cepine](../../lineages/cepine.md) shepherds and farmers. |
| Intrigue | An incredibly rural settlement far from most signs of civilisation, eking out a living despite the seasonal weather. |
