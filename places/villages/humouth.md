## Summary

Humouth is a village on the edge of the [River Humar](../rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) in [Central Astor](../regions/central-astor.md).

Set on a small cape that sticks out as the [River Humar](../rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) flows into the [Sea of Songs](../seas/sea-of-songs.md) at the edge of the [Carneid Inlet](../seas/carneid-inlet.md), Humouth is a village concerned with ships sailing in and out of the mainland. [Humouth Lighthouse](../buildings/humouth-lighthouse.md) provides a beacon for ships looking to enter the [River Humar](../rivers-lakes/river-humar.md) towards [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md), and the small fishing dock can be used to help ships in need.

The village itself is tightly clustered around the seafront, set atop a small cliff. The wooden docks are accessed down stairs carved into the cliff side. The buildings themselves are made entirely of cobbled stone, designed to weather the easterly winds and salt air. A small marketplace sits at its center, with an inn and store easily accessible.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Tightly clustered town of cobbled stone buildings set atop a small cliff overlooking the mouth of the [River Humar](../rivers-lakes/river-humar.md). A tall lighthouse dominates the skyline and can be seen from most places. Few outdoor embellishments or activity due to the wind and salt air. Wooden sea-weathered small dock at the bottom of the cliffs, accessible with stairs carved into cliff side. |
| Sounds | Wind howling between the buildings. Creaking of internal wood. Window shutters rattling. Seagulls squawking. |
| Smells | Sea salt air, seagull droppings. |
| People | Drigg, proceeding quickly about their business outside, relaxing inside. Some better off citizens. |
| Intrigue | A windy village with a lighthouse, clinging to the cliff side in defiance of the elements. |

### [Astorrel Agents](../../campaigns/astorrel-agents.md)

If the party passes through Humouth on their journey to [Arnaside](arnaside.md), they find the village hunkering down due to heavy winds that often blow through.
