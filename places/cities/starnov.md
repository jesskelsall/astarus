It is connected to the [Nilus Coast](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/nilus-coast.md) via [the Western Way](../roads/the-western-way.md), to the [Bay of Splendour](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/bay-of-splendour.md) to the north west, [Valburg](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) to the north east, and [Savnia](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/savnia.md) across the [Gulf of Tanelle](../seas-oceans/gulf-of-tanelle.md) via its large port.
