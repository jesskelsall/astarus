## Summary

The antithesis of [Hochwald](hochwald.md) or [Arrepont](arrepont.md), Murkwallow is as appealing as its name sounds. Situated on a marshy island in the [Scintil Delta](../rivers-lakes/scintil-delta.md), when the residents aren't backstabbing each other or the neighbouring states' guard forces aren't trying a power grab, the whole damned place is trying to sink into the mud.

The [Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) are headquartered in Murkwallow.
