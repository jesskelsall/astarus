## Summary

The antithesis of [Hochwald](hochwald.md) or [Arrepont](arrepont.md), Murkwallow is as appealing as its name sounds. Situated on a marshy island in the [Scintil Delta](../rivers-lakes/scintil-delta.md), when the residents aren't backstabbing each other or the neighbouring states' guard forces aren't trying a power grab, the whole damned place is trying to sink into the mud.

The [Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) are headquartered in Murkwallow.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Situated on a large delta island. Wooden two storey buildings, little stone due to weight. Divided into smaller islands by artificial canals used to transport goods through the city. No horses. Criss-crossing stone bridges. Each island forms a district with its own small marketplace. Some abandoned buildings that are sinking into the mud. |
| Sounds | Canal boat oars, active marketplace chatter. Barking dogs. |
| Smells | Mud, faeces, stale water, market produce. |
| People | Poor commoners that are fiercely independent, gangs that exert control over their own canal islands. [Revenucci](../../organisations/guards/revenucci.md) and [the Bay Watch](../../organisations/guards/the-bay-watch.md) guards trying to exert control unsuccessfully. |
| Intrigue | A poor city in an unlikely place, protected from the influence around them by rough terrain and rougher stubbornness. |
