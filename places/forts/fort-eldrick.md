## Summary

Fort Eldrick is a [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) fortification that protects [South East Kardan](../regions/south-east-kardan.md) from attacks via the Humar Estuary. It is one of the last lines of defence before [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md).

It is a long wall that stretches from the [River Carn](../rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) to [Duskmere](../rivers-lakes/duskmere.md), shore to shore. Half way along is a conjoined fort on the northern side, rectangular in design.

Central buildings with roads going round in a rectangle shape. Notably more traffic through the north gate. |

| Intrigue | A large fortification that defends against largely uninhabited estuary land. A relic of the Astor-Syntenne War, standing ever vigilant. |
