## Summary

The Sunset District is [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) inside the [Northhaven Wall](../structures/northhaven-wall.md). It is by far the richest and most opulent part of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), and where anyone who is anyone lives and works.

The district is home to branches of the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) and [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md), with both having their main strongholds here, though in the case of the [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), it isn't their biggest. There is also the only [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md) stronghold in Astor. It is from here that the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) is governed, and the General Supreme resides.

Outside of military business, the Sunset District is a cultural hub, featuring the finest architecture seen in the kingdom. Marble is used for the most important buildings, with polished stone a close second favourite. Most other buildings are made from stone with some decorative wooden elements.

Due to the strict requirements on getting in, the [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) here are polite and peaceful, with very little crime ever occurring. Those who are able to afford to settle here enjoy the finest things in life and the best level of protection available.

The district is focused around [Diamond Prime](../buildings/temples/diamond-prime.md), the largest and most important temple of [The Order of the Diamond](../../organisations/the-order-of-the-diamond.md) in the kingdom. From the square outside of its doors, the [Astornar](../../organisations/astornar.md), [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), and [Astorrel](../../organisations/astorrel/astorrel.md) strongholds are easily accessible.
