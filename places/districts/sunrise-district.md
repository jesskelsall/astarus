## Summary

The Sunrise District is [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) outside of the [Northhaven Wall](../structures/northhaven-wall.md). As only citizens may enter the wall, the [Sunset District](sunset-district.md) is home to many drigg. It is the largest district in the city by population.

This is where the squalor present in the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) is on show most prominently. Many flock to the city for its protection against the dangers of rural life and to seek new opportunities, but the heavy shanty town sprawl, poor living conditions, minimal job opportunities and notably aggressive [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) make it a grim place to live.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Multi-storey wooden houses and shacks, tightly packed between narrow streets. Muddy streets with small shops selling food and wares alike. |
| Sounds | People talking and shouting, children giggling or crying, horses, sizzling food on a grill, stall owners shouting to drum up business. [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) shouting at citizens. |
| Smells | Human excrement and sweat. Freshly baking bread, cooking meat. Wet wood and mud. |
| People | All sorts of people and races of various ages. Most look busy or tired, with disheveled looks and dirty clothes. |
| Intrigue | Despite the poverty evident in this district, the people here are often content. Some of the best food in Astor can be found here. |
