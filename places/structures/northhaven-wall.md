## Summary

The city wall was built during the [Astor-Syntenne War](../../history/events/astor-syntenne-war.md) to prevent a land-based invasion of the city. It is 10ft thick, on average 35ft tall, and made of stone from the slopes of [Walna Pike](../mountains/walna-pike.md) nearby.

These days it demarcates the inner [Sunset District](../districts/sunset-district.md), which is for military members only, from the outer [Sunrise District](../districts/sunrise-district.md), which is for everyone else.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Tall stone wall with periodic guard towers and gate houses. Both have clay roof tiles over them. |
| Sounds | Birds on the wall, sat on its edge or on outcroppings. |
| Smells | Bird poo. |
| People | [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md). Military members coming and going through the gate houses. |
| Intrigue | Permanent physical divide between citizens and drigg, representing the inequality of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). |

## Gate Houses

There are three gate houses that permit military members inside of the wall. These are placed to the north, north east, and south east. The north eastern gate house is the busiest, and the south east one is by far the quietest.

Each gate house has towers on either side which are always manned, checking for disturbances on the outer side.

The gate house itself has thicker walls and is manned by four [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) at all times. It has a large wrought iron portcullis that can be lowered to close access to the [Sunset District](../districts/sunset-district.md).

There is an anti-magic field present in and around the gate house, making it difficult for magical attacks on the gate house, or for people to slip inside disguised.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Large gate house with raised portcullis, two guard towers, lots of [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) on guard watch. Guards checking people who wish to enter. |
| Sounds | Chattering people, horses trotting, cart wheels. |
| Smells | Mud, animals. |
| People | [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md), military members, drigg. |
| Intrigue | Checking that everyone who wishes to enter is a huge undertaking, but the [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md) on guard are well trained. The anti-magic field makes deceiving them difficult. |

## Gaining Access

*See: [Military Badges](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/military-badges.md)*

Only military members may enter the [Sunset District](../districts/sunset-district.md) of [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md). In order to do so they must produce a military badge that belongs to them. It is a punishable crime to use a badge belonging to someone else in order to enter.

There is a degree of trust put in the individuals attempting to enter - if they look the part and wield a military badge confidently enough, and can answer some questions about themselves and their business, they will likely be granted access.

Carts and boxes brought through the gate are checked by the [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) [Astornox](../../organisations/astornox/astornox.md).
