## Summary

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Large stone block structure 10ft high. Two staircases from the street bordering the seafront ascend to the structure's main level. Four stone mounds with smooth slopes and staircases, each topped with a large naval cannon, pile of cannonballs, and a powder keg of gunpowder. Sheer 20ft drop into the sea. |
| Sounds | Crashing waves, seagulls. |
| Smells | Salt air, sand, bird droppings. |
| People | [Unicorn Cavalry](../../organisations/guards/unicorn-cavalry.md) guard patrol, one pair. One cannoneer per cannon, stationed at all hours. |
| Intrigue | A large coastal defence against a very real naval power's threat. |
