## Summary

Trest Marketplace lies in the middle of [Trest](../settlements/towns/trest.md), providing a commerce hub for over land trade across [the Western Way](../roads/the-western-way.md), and sea trade from the [Gulf of Tanelle](../topography/seas-bays/gulf-of-tanelle.md).

It is a series of large stone steps, offsetting the notable slope that [Trest](../settlements/towns/trest.md) was built upon. The middle slope is occupied by [the Western Way](../roads/the-western-way.md) as well as loading and unloading of goods from carts and coaches.

Gas lamps are used to provide a consistent source of light during the early and late hours, as well as the winter months. This is the only form of municipal lighting in [Trest](../settlements/towns/trest.md).
