## Planning

### Trouble in [Arnaside](../settlements/villages/arnaside.md)

The night before the party arrives, the [blue kobolds](../../lineages/blue-kobold.md) attack the logging camp under the cover of dark and wind. They destroy one of the logging carts and steal some woodworking tools.

When the party first arrives at the logging camp, several loggers are cleaning up after the chaos of the kobold attack the night before.

[Kulegar Bronhor](../../characters/kulegar-bronhor.md) is coordinating the repair of the cart, judging one of the wheels destroyed beyond repair.

There is little wood in the logging camp, showing that logging operations have slowed. Several loggers have given up for now, too afraid to log because of the creatures in the forest.
