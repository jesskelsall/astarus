## Summary

The Dulsenn Graveyard was a burial complex used for preserving and honouring the remains of dead elves, in keeping with the traditions of [Malnesh](../../gods/deities/malnesh.md). Its mausoleum lead to a crypt containing mostly unidentified remains, which grew restless as memories of the dead faded immediately.

[Vivien Bouxelles](../../characters/vivien-bouxelles.md) was one of the notable dead in the crypt. Her ghost haunted it, helping to animate the other dead to protect her blade, [Mémoire de Unevaire](../../items/echneshment/weapons/memoire-de-unevaire.md).

The graveyard is the subject of [Mémoire de Cimetière](../../items/echneshment/memory-spheres/memoire-de-cimetiere.md).
