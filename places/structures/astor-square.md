## Summary

Astor Square is the main square in the [Sunset District](../settlements/districts/sunset-district.md) of [Northhaven](../settlements/cities/northhaven.md). It is a place where people meet and congregate, as well as where many of the year's celebrations take place, or rallies and parades happen.

It is a square made mostly of stone, with some iron and wood benches for seating. There are a few statues, an intricately sculpted fountain, and flowers in potters. Lamps with perpetual magic light illuminate the area after dark.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Stone slabbed square. Statues of people and animals. Central fountain with flowing marble sculpture. Benches, potted plants with flowers, lamps. Plenty of people but no horses or carts. |
| Sounds | Chatter, birds flying, the water in the fountain. |
| Smells | Pleasant flower scents drifting on the wind. |
| People | Citizens, respectable [Astornox](../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) presence. |
| Intrigue | This looks just like a marketplace in any UK town centre. There is a lot of open space here in stark contrast to the claustrophobic buildings of the [Sunrise District](../settlements/districts/sunrise-district.md). |
