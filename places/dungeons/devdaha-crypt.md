## Summary

Devdaha Crypt is a secret dungeon-like crypt that runs underneath the [Shrine to the Stars](../structures/shrine-to-the-stars.md). It traces an ancient path under the mountain range, ascending to one of its peaks.

One of the remaining sources of knowledge on [strigid](../../lineages/strigid.md), the crypt is guarded by various magical safeguards, requiring a startouched who has control of their Starry Form to even enter the crypt. It is overseen by [Deorvys](../../characters/deorvys.md) and their offspring [Fraevuth](../../characters/fraevuth.md).

Created by the giants of [Astarus](../../celestial-objects/astarus.md) for the [strigid](../../lineages/strigid.md) in [Devdaha](../villages/devdaha.md) from the valley below, the crypt was originally used to bury startouched village elders. Following [the Third Coming](../../history/events/the-third-coming.md) and [the arrival](../../history/events/the-third-coming.md) of the [Cepine](../../lineages/cepine.md) to the [Albulain valley](../plains-valleys/albulain-valley.md), prominent [cepine](../../lineages/cepine.md) were buried in the unused first chamber of the crypt.

*This dungeon was designed for four 6th level characters.*

## Entering

A startouched that has their Starry Form active at the [Shrine to the Stars](../structures/shrine-to-the-stars.md) will be able to see a staircase descending into the intact horizontal standing stone. During this time the stone will not be corporeal, allowing anyone present to descend it, though only the startouched will be able to see the staircase. Once inside the exit is visible to anyone, but travel is one way without Starry Form active.

## Mechanics

The following mechanics are in effect while inside the Devdaha Crypt.

### A Dragon's Lair

Devdaha Crypt is a crystal dragon's lair. As such the following effects are observed within 6 miles of its lair:

- The skies remain clear at all times unless magically altered.
- Quartz crystals are observed in higher than natural quantities.
- The crystal dragon can use ice and quartz as sensors for the [Clairvoyance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/clairvoyance) spell.
- Spending a long rest gains 2 addition hit dice (ends immediately upon the dragon's death)
- Abundance of wildlife and foliage. Scavenging for food is done with advantage (ends 1d10 days after the dragon's death).

As the dragons residing here are young, these effects are not particularly strong, instead appearing subtle and difficult to notice to less discerning eyes.

### Danger While Resting

[Ice Mephits](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ice-mephit) roam the crypt, posing a danger to those who choose to stop and rest. Should they come across the party, there is the usual chance for them to be seen before getting the drop on them.
