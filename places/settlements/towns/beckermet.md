## Summary

Beckermet is a medium sized town between [Eaglesfield](eaglesfield.md) and [Goldreach](goldreach.md), along the [Northern Road](../../roads/northern-road.md).

The town is situated next to the [River Humar](../../topography/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md), where the [Northern Road](../../roads/northern-road.md) is closest to the river. Between the road and here, the town popped up, now sprawling down to the water's edge. There are some docks here to support river trade, though most people and products reach Beckermet by horse and cart.

Beckermet is known as a farming town, using the vast plans in all directions to provide a notable amount of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md)'s food. This production has made the land owners wealthy, bringing prosperity to the town. Natural warm hot springs power the famous bath houses which bring visitors from the larger cities.
