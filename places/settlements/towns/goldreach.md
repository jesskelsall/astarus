## Summary

Goldreach is a town in northern Astor. It is the northernmost settlement along the [Northern Road](../../roads/northern-road.md), and the last before entering the [Dardenn Kingdom](../../../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md).

Built on a natural spring in the plains, Goldreach is not walled and rarely in any danger due to the amicable relationship with the [Dardenn Kingdom](../../../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md) to the north. It is built around a Marketplace and features an Order of the Diamond temple, an [Astornox](../../../organisations/government/astornox/astornox.md) stronghold with an outer wall, lively shops and a few notable inns.

It is known for its cosmopolitan residents, bustling trade, and general good hospitality, making it a favourite rest stop for frequent travelers. There are many farms in the vicinity, so it is an agricultural hub with much food and animals passing through it.
