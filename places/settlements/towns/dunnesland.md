## Summary

Dünnesland is a moderately sized town along the western bank of the [River Trogen](../../topography/rivers-lakes/river-trogen.md), famed for its fiercely competitive breweries, fortress walls and towers, and as a rest stop between [Arrepont](../cities/arrepont.md) and [Hochwald](../cities/hochwald.md). While not a trade town, Dünnesland benefits from local barley production and the clear river waters to produce its ale.

It was strategically built to protect southern [Valburg](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) in the early years following [The Third Coming](../../../history/events/the-third-coming.md), helping to establish [Valburg](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) as its own state.

Dünnesland is inspired by [San Gimignano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gimignano).
