## Summary

Hyceodd is a former fortress come town along the [Great Astor Road](../../roads/great-astor-road.md), the only settlement between [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md) and [Yeatscale](../cities/yeatscale.md). A strategic position where the [River Carn](../../topography/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) meets the [Carneid Inlet](../../topography/seas-bays/carneid-inlet.md), Hyceodd's tall walls and large harbour hint at its prior strategic role in the [Astor-Syntenne War](../../../history/events/astor-syntenne-war.md).

These days Hyceodd is increasingly cosmopolitan due to being a destination for immigrants coming from the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) and the [Syntenne Republic](../../../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).
