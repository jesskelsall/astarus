## Summary

Fort Eldrick is a [Kingdom of Astor](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md) fortification that protects [Southeastern Kardan](../../regions/southeastern-kardan.md) from attacks via the Humar Estuary. It is one of the last lines of defence before [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md).

It is a long wall that stretches from the [River Carn](../../topography/rivers-lakes/river-carn.md) to [Duskmere](../../topography/rivers-lakes/duskmere.md), shore to shore. Half way along is a conjoined fort on the northern side, rectangular in design.

Gatehouses on north and south, each deep and heavily guarded. Outer portcullis and inner double swinging 20ft tall doors, 2 guards needed on each to operate. Central buildings with roads going round in a rectangle shape. Notably more traffic through the north gate. |
| Sounds | [Astornox guards](../../../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md) chatting, armour moving, pigeons nesting. |

| People | [Astornox guards](../../../organisations/government/astornox/ranks/astornox-guard.md). |
| Intrigue | A large fortification that defends against largely uninhabited estuary land. A relic of the [Astor-Syntenne War](../../../history/events/astor-syntenne-war.md), standing ever vigilant. |
