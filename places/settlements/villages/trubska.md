## Summary

Trubska is a small mining town nestled between the hills south of the [Nilus Peaks](../../topography/mountains/nilus-peaks.md). It is located north of [Trest](../towns/trest.md), relying on the town's connections to [the Western Way](../../roads/the-western-way.md) and the [Gulf of Tanelle](../../topography/seas-oceans/gulf-of-tanelle.md) to sell its produce. It sits on a natural spring which provides both drinking and bathing water for the local bath house.
