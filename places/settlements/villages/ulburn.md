## Summary

Ulburn is a village in central Astor just north of [Northhaven](../cities/northhaven.md), across the [Great Astor Road](../../roads/great-astor-road.md). It is situated in a particularly large bend of the [River Humar](../../topography/rivers-lakes/river-humar.md).

The village is tightly packed, using all of the available space in the river's bend. Newer buildings are 2 storeys tall and can run right to the water. There is a sense here that Ulburn is on the up, transitioning from typical cobble and stone to more sophisticated stone buildings.
