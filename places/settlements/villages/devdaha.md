## Summary

Devdaha was a [strigid](../../../lineages/strigid.md) village that existed prior to [the second coming](../../../history/events/the-second-coming.md), formed in the [Albulain Valley](../../topography/valleys-plains-deserts/albulain-valley.md). It was protected by a neighbouring golden dragon, and saw cooperation with nearby stone giants.

In -113,493 [AA](../../../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md), [Nallu](../../../characters/nallu.md), the dying village elder, used [Wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish) to summon the last of his kind, transporting [Ephaine Seren](../../../characters/ephaine-seren.md) into the past.
