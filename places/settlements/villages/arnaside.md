## Summary

Arnaside is a village on the coast of the [Sea of Songs](../../topography/seas-oceans/sea-of-songs.md), near to where [Walna Forest](../../topography/forests/walna-forest.md) meets the sea.

The village is set upon sheer high cliffs, 50ft tall in some places. Here the eastern extents of the [Walna Forest](../../topography/forests/walna-forest.md) reach the tall cliffs. Between the two is where Arnaside was built. The buildings are single storey cobbled stone structures with gradually sloping roofs covered in thick grass for insulation and to keep the often heavy winds out. The only building that deviates from this low profile is 

Surrounding the village, the villagers log the [Walna Forest](../../topography/forests/walna-forest.md) for profit, which can be traded for any goods they can't produce themselves. They grow their own crops, rear their own sheep, and produce all of the basic goods that they need. They even brew their own beer, though it is lacklustre.

The villagers here are world weary and happy for this slower and simpler life, though it takes a physical toll just to get by. The attitude of working hard and honouring their god, [Malnesh](../../../gods/deities/malnesh.md), is monastery-esque.

| Smells | Cooking food. |
| People | Drigg living content with hard working and self-sufficient lives. |
| Intrigue | Like a monastery of people who worship a different god, who have exiled themselves here for some peace. |

## History

*See: [Timeline](../../../history/timeline.md)*

Arnaside was founded in 297 [PA](../../../history/calendars/astorian-calendar.md), 15 years before the [campaigns](../../../campaigns/README.md) start. It was settled by a disparate group of [Malnesh](../../../gods/deities/malnesh.md) worshippers who wished to worship their god in peace away from the teachings of [The Order of the Diamond](../../../organisations/the-order-of-the-diamond.md). They refer to themselves as *Malneshi* - worshippers of [Malnesh](../../../gods/deities/malnesh.md).

Since then, the village has steadily grown as other worshippers come to settle here, thanks to the diligent work of a few villagers who travel the cities and speak of the village to other worshippers.

[The Malneshitas](../../buildings/temples/the-malneshitas.md) has been erected since then, with a crypt below excavated over the last 3 years. Here the villagers have started to store the skeletal remains of their dead - 22 so far.
