## Summary

Nestled in the [Ciel Mountains](../../topography/mountains/ciel-mountains.md) at the base of Mont Pr√©sage, the Lelxuuth clan have done the impossible and literally carved a thriving city into the mountain side. The most isolated of all the dragonborn clans, Lelxuuth is a haven for those wishing for a peaceful life away from worldly worries.

Lelxuuth is surprisingly open to outsiders compared to most clan settlements. This allows the city to sustain itself with talent and ideas that further their goals of independent prosperity and the collection of historical knowledge.

[The Time Enlightened](../../../organisations/the-time-enlightened.md) were formed and are headquartered in Lelxuuth.
