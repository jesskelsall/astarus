| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | Urban core of 3 and 4 storey buildings in stone with some painted wood elements. Long boulevard style streets filled with traders and citizens. Grand indoor markets, football field sized with zigzag stone and glass roofs, tower over lesser buildings. Terraced houses with different families on each floor. Magically lit street lighting around the busiest areas, oil lamps otherwise. |
| Sounds | Horses and carts, heavy foot traffic. Traders shouting. Ship bells. |
| Smells | Mild excrement, fried food. Variety of exotic spices and wares. |
| People | Commoners of all wealth levels. Traders in scarcely believable numbers. [Coastguard](../../../organisations/guards/coastguard.md) standing in groups. Children playing in side streets. |
| Intrigue | A hub of trade activity, urbanising and modernising through the wealth it brings. |
