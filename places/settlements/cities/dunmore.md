## Summary

Dunmore is a city in eastern Astor. It is the main settlement in this region.

Set on the cliffs of the [Sea of Songs](../../topography/seas-oceans/sea-of-songs.md), Dunmore is a fishing harbour set on the notoriously rough terrain that characterises this region. With the [Sea of Songs](../../topography/seas-oceans/sea-of-songs.md) to the east, the Fleecewood to the west, and sharp barren cliffs in between, Dunmore was built here as it was the best of a bad bunch of places available.

The city is set above the cliffs on multiple levels, with staircases and bridges connecting the different sections of the city together. The port at the base of the cliffs overflows with fishing ships due to the plentiful fish in the area around the city. Nobody goes hungry in Dunmore, even if the fish isn't the tastiest in the kingdom.

Life here is a constant fight. The winds coming from across the sea buffet the city regularly, so all of the buildings are made from heavy stone mined from the nearby cliffs. Ships frequently wreck against the cliffs near here, devastating the families that rely on the income, and fuelling sea creature & ghost stories.

## [Astorrel](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) Training Programme

*See: [Astorrel](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md)*

The [Astorrel](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) sends their recruits here for training, in a process that takes 2-4 years. While here they stay in the [Astorrel](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md) stronghold within the city, which is mostly set underground in the coastal caves. 

Recruits are set up with their mentors who then take them out into the wilderness to learn about nature. A combination of nearby mountains, forest, jagged coastal terrain, and the sea make this the perfect place to bend recruits near to breaking point in order to see if they are up to the task of becoming an [Astorrel](../../../organisations/government/astorrel/astorrel.md).
