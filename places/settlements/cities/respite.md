## Summary

Respite is the only settlement in the [City of Respite](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/city-of-respite.md) state of the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md).

Respite mostly keeps to itself. The city's tiefling founders took heavy inspiration from tribalism of the dragonborn clans, taking the concept to new extremes. Religion is banned, everyone works equally towards the city's prosperity, and citizens shed their baggage from their past life, including their original name.

All of Respite's residents have virtue names - a single word that embodies their ideals. It is common for many people to share the same name, but the collective nature of the city makes this a non-issue.

Outsiders are not permitted to enter the city walls unless they are made Cousins of Respite - an honour seldom given to diplomats and famed heroes who have served the city.
