## Summary

Upper Tresenda is a small mountain valley tucked away in the northeast corner of the [Tresenda Pass](../roads/tresenda-pass.md), sitting in the shadow of the [Foss Peaks](../mountains/foss-peaks.md). It is off the main trail and a dead end, making it unremarkable.

It is the landing site of the [Tresenda Meteorite](../../items/meteoric/meteorites/tresenda-meteorite.md). [The meteorics](../../lineages/the-meteorics.md) it spawned stripped Upper Tresenda of every piece of nature, turning it into an alarming barren wasteland, kept out of view due to its hidden location.
