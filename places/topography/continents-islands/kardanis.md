## Summary

Kardanis is a large volcanic island off the south east coast of Kardanis. It is mostly grassland and agriculture, fertilised by volcanic minerals and ash from [Karmox](../mountains/karmox.md), the volcano to its south west.

Despite its geographic separation from [Southeastern Kardan](../../regions/southeastern-kardan.md), Kardanis is under the control of the [Kingdom of Astor](../../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), who formed the various towns and villages on the island.
