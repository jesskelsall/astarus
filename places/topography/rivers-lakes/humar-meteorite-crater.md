## Summary

The Humar Meteorite Crater is a small lake on the Humar Estuary, created when the [Humar Meteorite](../../../items/meteoric/meteorites/humar-meteorite.md) landed. The crater has since filled with water, creating an unnatural lake.

| Sensation | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| Sights | 800ft diameter round lake. Abrupt sides that don't conform to the nearby landscape undulations and hills. Reeds only for the first foot, indicating a sudden increase in depth due to its bowl-like shape. Murky water that only provides 15ft of visibility. |
| Sounds | Birds, rain. |
| Smells | Stagnant water, grass, mud. |
| People | [Giant Crocodile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-crocodile) |
| Intrigue | A [meteorite](../../../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) crater that looks like a lake to the untrained eye. |
