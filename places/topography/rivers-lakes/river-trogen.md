## Summary

The River Trogen is a dual source river in the east of the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md), meeting north of Effrontée before flowing into the northern branch of the [Gulf of Tanelle](../seas-bays/gulf-of-tanelle.md).

North Trogen starts in the [Vourpain Peaks](../mountains/vourpain-peaks.md) and winds through the [Trogenwald](../forests/trogenwald.md), forming the boundary between [Valburg](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) and [Savnia](../../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/savnia.md).

South Trogen begins in the Dunenne Mountains, flows north, and is the site of many of the first settlements following [The Second Coming](../../../history/events/the-second-coming.md).
