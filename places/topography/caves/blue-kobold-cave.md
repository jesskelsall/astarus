## Summary

The Blue Kobold Cave system is set within a hill deep in the [Walna Forest](../forests/walna-forest.md), north of the [Arnaside Logging Camp](../../structures/arnaside-logging-camp.md). It is home to a tribe of [blue kobolds](../../../lineages/blue-kobold.md).

The cave itself has been carved into the stone hillside, with maze-like twisting passageways, elevation changes, large open rooms, and an inner sanctum hidden behind a wooden door and narrow snaking passageway.

The inner sanctum features 4 angled hexagonal pillars made of the same surrounding stone, but perfectly smooth and unnaturally proportional, created by [Cheorrosdyr](../../../characters/cheorrosdyr.md) when the tribe was left here. Beyond them a raised area contains a small pedestal containing the tribes most coveted possessions:

| Large polished turquoise gemstone | 15 gp |
