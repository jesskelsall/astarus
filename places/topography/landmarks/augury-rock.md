## History

The insider [gods](../../../gods/gods.md) [Bhygar](../../../gods/deities/bhygar.md), [Valnos](../../../gods/deities/valnos.md), [Kirrel](../../../gods/deities/kirrel.md) and [Gormox](../../../gods/deities/gormox.md) chose this rock as a sacred place, binding what little connection they have to [Astarus](../../../celestial-objects/astarus.md) to it. It was chosen because it is unsuspecting, remote, yet accessible for those with enough determination.

The three deva ([Minsas](../../../characters/minsas.md), [Seraphina](../../../characters/seraphina.md), [Mykiel](../../../characters/mykiel.md)) were created here by the [gods](../../../gods/gods.md) and sent to protect their [aasimar](../../../lineages/aasimar.md). Only here are they able to appear at will and speak, allowing them to communicate directly with their [aasimar](../../../lineages/aasimar.md).

Upon [Allisa Balsatra](../../../characters/allisa-balsatra.md)'s [aasimar](../../../lineages/aasimar.md) awakening, she travelled here following hints laid out to her by [Minsas](../../../characters/minsas.md). [Minsas](../../../characters/minsas.md) appeared to her and told her of the existence of other [aasimar](../../../lineages/aasimar.md), speaking of plans being put into motion by the [gods](../../../gods/gods.md).
