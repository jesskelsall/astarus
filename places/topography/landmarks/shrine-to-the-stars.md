## Summary

The Shrine to the Stars is an ancient set of standing stones set on a ridge on the lower part of the [Foss Peaks](../mountains/foss-peaks.md)' west face. It overlooks [Filisur](../../settlements/villages/filisur.md), with a rough route up to it available.

Created by the [strigid](../../../lineages/strigid.md) with the help of the giants, the standing stones allowed startouched to communicate with [Pajaru](../../../gods/deities/kaldoon.md), their god amongst the stars. In modern times it is seen by the [Cepine](../../../lineages/cepine.md) as the best place for observing the stars.

A secret entrance amongst the stones provides access to the [Devdaha Crypt](../../structures/dungeons/devdaha-crypt.md).
