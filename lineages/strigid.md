## Summary

Strigids are a near extinct race of owlfolk that arrived on [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md) during The First Coming over 180,000 years ago. They lived in small valley communities and studied the stars.

Following [The Arrival](../history/events/the-arrival.md), strigid society reacted to [the arrival](../history/events/the-arrival.md) of the greater races by abandoning their villages in favour of high mountain perches, destroying evidence of their existence as they left.
