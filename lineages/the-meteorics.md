## Summary

The Meteorics are an affiliation of constructs created by [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md) and [Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md), visited upon [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md) via meteors from the sky. They are made of [meteoric dust](../items/meteoric/meteoric-dust.md), fashioned into creatures half way between constructs and beasts. Their intentions remain a mystery.

## History

[Malnesh](../gods/deities/malnesh.md), having brought the elves to [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md) to escape persecution, was unhappy to find the insider [gods](../gods/gods.md) (led by [Bhygar](../gods/deities/bhygar.md)) copying her idea with [The Arrival](../history/events/the-third-coming.md).

Working with her long time friend [Kaldoon](../gods/deities/kaldoon.md), the pair devised a plan to remove the new races from [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md). With her magic and his combat savviness, the pair created the meteorics as an invasion force to either cause the insider [gods](../gods/gods.md) to remove the races from the planet, or if not, to wipe them out.

Not wanting to draw too much attention to what machinations the pair of [gods](../gods/gods.md) were enacting, the first [meteorites](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) on which the first meteorics arrived were targeted in rural places, where the meteorics would have time to grow and learn of their potential.

With initial successes, the pair are accelerating their attacks, preparing to break cover and begin their campaign of annihilation.
