# Gods

On [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md) the influence of the gods is minimal. Most people believe that they exist, but there is very rarely any indication of this outside of their belief.

## Insider Gods

It is said that the insider gods created [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md), prepared it, and brought the races to it so that they could settle and thrive. Now they take up more of a “caretaker” role, keeping the forces in balance and avoiding influencing mortal affairs.

## Outsider Gods

Some additionally worship alternative gods, either alongside the four or as alternatives. These two lesser deities ([Malnesh](deities/malnesh.md), [Kaldoon](deities/kaldoon.md)) are worshipped by smaller followings, and in dedicated religious buildings. [The Order of the Diamond](../organisations/the-order-of-the-diamond.md) dubs these gods the outsider gods.

These gods are newer (last 50 years) and are slowly growing in popularity. Their rise is often attributed to their positive teachings and help ease worries about the harsher teachings of the original four.
