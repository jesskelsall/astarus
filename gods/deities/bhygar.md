## Teachings

> All stories begin with life and end with death. It's what we do in the middle that counts.

Bhygar's duality between life and death instills a sort of nihilism between his followers. Death is inevitable and not really to be celebrated. Instead, life and how it is lived is to be cherished, living in the moment.

## Imagery

### Symbol

His symbol is a grey circle containing two overlapping circles - white on the left, black on the right, with the overlapping portion also in grey.

### Representation

He is represented by two robed humans, both holding the same book between them, with one hand each. Like his symbol, the left human wears white, the right human wears black.
