## Teachings

> Only in death do our legacies endure, our deeds tallied and judged. To face death is to live.

Malnesh is an alternative view on the role of death in one's life. Her followers believe that grieving for the dead and continuing to honour them after they have gone is crucial. This places more emphasis on legacy than the moment-to-moment thrill of life.

## Imagery

### Symbol

Her symbol is a black half-circle, flat side down, containing two teardrops. The left teardrop is blue and the right teardrop is red.

- Blue teardrop: grieving for those lost.
- Red teardrop: blood, life, lineage.

## Worship

The worship of The Judge Mother is a fringe movement within the [Kingdom of Astor](../../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md). Those who worship Malnesh exclusively call themselves *Malneshi*. They are typically tolerant of others' faith.

Malneshi honour the dead by performing funeral rites, taking care of the remains of the deceased (preserving the bones), and honouring the memory of the deceased on the day of their death each year. Those who make a last wish before dying have it carried out fervently by those who are there to witness it.
