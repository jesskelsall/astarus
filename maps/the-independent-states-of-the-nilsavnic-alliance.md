## Summary

The Independent States of the Nil'Savnic Alliance is a [map of the Nil'Savnic Alliance](map-of-the-nilsavnic-alliance.md) and its states. It is widely available within the alliance itself.

The map puts emphasis on settlements, roads, trade routes, and the borders of the eight states. Comparably little detail is shown for the [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) and [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), both of which feature on the edges of the map. Forests and even settlements outside of the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md) are absent.
