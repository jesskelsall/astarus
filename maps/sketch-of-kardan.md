## Summary

The Sketch of Kardan is a continent scale map built to provide the shape of [Kardan](../places/topography/continents-islands/kardan.md). It was created around a base of the [Astorrel Map of Southeastern Kardan](astorrel-map-of-southeastern-kardan.md) and allowed an area to be picked for creating the more detailed [Independent States of the Nil'Savnic Alliance](independent-states-of-the-nilsavnic-alliance.md) map.

Blue lines denote the presence of civilisations on the continent. Top to bottom: [Dardenn Kingdom](../civilisations/dardenn-kingdom/dardenn-kingdom.md), [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md), [Kingdom of Astor](../civilisations/kingdom-of-astor/kingdom-of-astor.md), [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md), [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).
