## Summary

The Meteoric Map of Astor is a crude recreation of an [Astorrel Map of Southeastern Kardan](astorrel-map-of-southeastern-kardan.md), created so that it could be drawn on. It shows the location of [meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorite.md) impact sites known to [Astral Squad](../organisations/government/astorrel/squads/astral-squad.md) prior to the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) campaign, with the potential impact site of the [Goldreach Meteorite](../items/meteoric/meteorites/goldreach-meteorite.md) circled.

## History

The map belonged to [Wrenn Piznarck](../characters/wrenn-piznarck.md) who showed it to and then later gave it to the [Purple Rain](../campaigns/C1-purple-rain.md) party, [Thanea Morlay](../characters/thanea-morlay.md) taking possession, retaining it after Wrenn was captured by [the Crimson Blades](../organisations/criminals/the-crimson-blades.md).

## Mistakes

The map is incomplete, not showing all settlements featured on the [Astorrel Map of Southeastern Kardan](astorrel-map-of-southeastern-kardan.md). There are also several incorrectly named settlements.

These mistakes are down to my iteration on [Southeastern Kardan](../places/regions/southeastern-kardan.md) and not realising I had already named some of the settlements.
