| **Item** |
| **[Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) [Coin of Family](../../items/coin-of-family.md)** |
| *It might be made of gold, but the true value of this coin is in what it represents.<br>Quite simply it represents family, and the strength of those bonds.* |
| A large golden coin used by [Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) to<br>represent an indivdual’s membership. |
| A relief of the organisation’s symbol is stamped into one side,<br>and the roof vaulting inside the Fox’s Hole on the back. |
