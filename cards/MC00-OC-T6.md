| **Active Bonus** |
| **Trinket Curiosity** |
| *We are out in the world in search of artefacts that further our understanding of [Astarus](../planes/astarus.md), [Oonar](../planes/oonar.md), and the Comings.* |
| Intelligence (History) and Intelligence (Arcana) checks have advantage when examining artefacts. |

| **Downtime Bonus** |
| **Praise the Bestower** |
| *While most would say that the [gods](../gods/gods.md) haven't played an active role since [The Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md), my experiences beg to differ. [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md) clearly rewards our servitude.* |
| During downtime you may spend 1 day working to assist a shrine or temple to [Valnos](../gods/deities/valnos.md), if one is present. |
| Doing so grants proficiency in a skill of your choice for 1d4 days, or expertise in a skill you are already proficient in. |
