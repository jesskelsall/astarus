| *It's impossible to get lost along the [Nilus Coast](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/nilus-coast.md). You can only go east or west along its single road, or take a ride on a ship to a more interesting state.* |
| One of the two founding states of the [Nil'Savnic Alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md), the entire state runs between the [Nilus Peaks](../places/topography/mountains/nilus-peaks.md) to its north and the [Gulf of Tanelle](../places/topography/seas-oceans/gulf-of-tanelle.md) to its south. Easy access to the seas provides prosperity through seafaring trade, though at the cost of being the first land targeted by [Kavallos Fleet](../civilisations/kavallos-fleet/kavallos-fleet.md) raids. |
