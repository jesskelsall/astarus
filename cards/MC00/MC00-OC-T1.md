| *They weren't particularly friendly, but I've never seen people so driven.<br>It took them days to restore the magic item that I spent months puzzling over.* |
| Devout worshippers of [Valnos](../../gods/deities/valnos.md), the thirst for knowledge fuels<br>[The Time Enlightened](../../organisations/the-time-enlightened.md). They travel the land searching for<br>any knowledge about how the races came to [Astarus](../../planes/astarus.md),<br>but particularly what came before. |
