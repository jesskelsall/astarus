| **Invisible Ink** |
| *Sometimes you just need to send a letter about grain shipments. The guards searching through letters will find it intensely boring and think nothing of it.* |
| Invisible ink can be used to write secret messages that are hidden on otherwise innocuous looking letters. |
| The ink is slightly magical, allowing it be detected and read by those with the ability to. |
