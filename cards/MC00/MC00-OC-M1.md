| *By the time we figured out who they were, it was all over. Their reputation is no joke.<br>We thought we were dealing with 2 people until 4 more descended upon us.* |
| Those who lurk in the shadows don't like hearing of the<br>[Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) as their involvement means trouble.<br>Opportunists who play by their own rules, their<br>guiding principle is surprisingly simple - profit. |
