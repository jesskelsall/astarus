| **Fame** |
| *When others fear us, they're more likely to do what we need of them. Why? Because they know that the alternative is bad enough when imagined.* |
| Other criminals have an uneasy respect for [Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md). While other career criminals don't like the way that [Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) operate, their notoriety in those circles is its own currency. |

| **Infamy** |
| *Operating in the shadows make it harder to stand in the light. If you're caught, proudly tell them who you are but don't lead them back here! * |
| Law enforcement recognises [Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) as criminals. Guards and other peacekeepers will actively work against known [Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md), as typically organised crime should be stamped out. |
