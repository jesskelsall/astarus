| **Home Settlement** |
| **[Hochwald](../../places/cities/hochwald.md) ♢ City** |
| *Towers of marble, city of mine.<br>Shimmering views, lake of mine.<br>Sweet fruits aplenty, valley of mine.<br>Gentle horizons, mountains of mine.* |
| Formed immediately after The Third Coming, [Hochwald](../../places/cities/hochwald.md) is a centre of culture that rivals the first city of [Arrepont](../../places/cities/arrepont.md) itself. Idyllic views of [Lake Gondra](../../places/rivers-lakes/lake-gondra.md) and easy trade routes to [Valburg](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md)'s neighbours have allowed Hochwalders to grow rich and continue to improve the city for everyone. |

| **Home Bonus** |
| **Generous Compensation** |
| *Her errands are often frustrating and her standards are high, but as long as you keep in her good graces, on your return you're treat like royalty.* |
| When returning to [Lady Crane](../../organisations/lady-crane.md)'s Château in [Hochwald](../../places/cities/hochwald.md), members are able to enjoy an aristocratic lifestyle and food at her expense. |
| Additionally [Lady Crane](../../organisations/lady-crane.md) will purchase any supplies or transportation her members need that they can justify. |
