| *I had a few buyers lined up, but it was all for nothing once [Lady Crane](../../organisations/lady-crane.md)'s hand<br>showed up. They flashed their coin and twisted my arm until I couldn't say no.* |
| [Lady Crane](../../organisations/lady-crane.md) keeps her true identity secret, but her eccentricity<br>and enormous wealth is well known. Those fortunate enough<br>to have earned her trust are sent to cater to her whims.<br>In return they are exceptionally well taken care of. |
