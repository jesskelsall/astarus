| **Skimmersign** |
| *Following that failed job it became a priority to find a way to communicate silently. And so we created Skimmersign out of necessity.* |
| Add Skimmersign to your known languages. Skimmersign is a form of sign language that allows for silent communication with the use of only one hand. |

| **Downtime Bonus** |
| **The Endless Marsh** |
| *When they say there are ears and eyes everywhere, in our case this is literal. We've made it our business to have a presence in every settlement worth talking about.* |
| During downtime in any town or city you can easily find another Marsh Skimmer. |
| This allows you to interact with your organisation from almost anywhere, and quickly. |
