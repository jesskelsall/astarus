| **Fame** |
| *As our reputation grows it's becoming increasingly common to get chatting to the locals in the tavern and suddenly find yourself unable to pay for your own drink. * |
| [Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) are friends to commoners and guards alike. Their can-do attitude and willingness to help the communities they visit encourages those suffering the most to help them out. |

| **Infamy** |
| *Unsurprisingly all of our good deeds aren't to everyone's tastes. Quite often we are hindering criminals who are preying on the vulnerable.* |
| [Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) is seen as an enemy of criminal organisations. Not afraid to tackle crime and corruption, [Familia Vulpes](../../organisations/familia-vulpes.md) are too virtuous for most criminals' tastes.  |
