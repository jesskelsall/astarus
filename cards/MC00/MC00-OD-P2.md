| **Peer Ability** |
| **[Instinctual Planning](../../mechanics/character-features/instinctual-planning.md)** |
| *There's a certain way that we operate that makes this look like magic.<br>Really it's good training and an implicit trust in each other.* |
| Once per combat encounter and before the start<br>of any character's turn, you and another member<br>of your organisation may both use this ability<br>to swap initiative order with each other. |
