| **Home Settlement** |
| **[Murkwallow](../../places/cities/murkwallow.md) â™¢ City** |
| *The City of Thieves is such a reductionist name for this wonderful place. It is also home to cut-throats, crooks, and worst of all - two meddling states.* |
| The antithesis of [Hochwald](../../places/cities/hochwald.md) or [Arrepont](../../places/cities/arrepont.md), [Murkwallow](../../places/cities/murkwallow.md) is as appealing as its name sounds. Situated on a marshy island in the [Scintil Delta](../../places/rivers-lakes/scintil-delta.md), when the residents aren't backstabbing each other or the neighbouring states' guard forces aren't trying a power grab, the whole damned place is trying to sink into the mud. |

| **Home Bonus** |
| **Enterprising Opportunities** |
| *Being part of a state-spanning criminal syndicate certainly has its perks.
There is always money to be had from taking from others - their valuables and lives.* |
| When returning to Tabaxi's Folly in [Murkwallow](../../places/cities/murkwallow.md), [Marsh Skimmers](../../organisations/marsh-skimmers.md) members are always able to find contract work. |
| These jobs pay members well and typically involve illegal activities. |
