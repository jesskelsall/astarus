| *For such a small area with two guard forces poking around, the delta is surprisingly lawless. A haven for chancers and unscrupulous types.* |
| While [Revenossa](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/revenossa.md) and the [Bay of Splendour](../../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/bay-of-splendour.md) draw their border along the [River Scintil](../../places/rivers-lakes/river-scintil.md), the [Scintil Delta](../../places/rivers-lakes/scintil-delta.md) remains an area of contention for both states. Both try to control the settlements on the islands to varying success, not helped by the locals who are quite happy being defiantly independent. |
