| **Item** |
| **Strange Sphere** |
| A reflective metal sphere, about 4 inches in diameter.<br>There are no visible seams or tool marks on its surface. |
| It doesnâ€™t feel solid. |
| When tipped or shaken, small pieces<br>of metal can be heard rattling around inside. |
| It smells faintly of burning metal and ozone. |
