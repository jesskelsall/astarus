| **[Spiked Rosemelon](../items/spiked-rosemelon.md)** |
| *They say this weird plant is a delicacy, but personally I donâ€™t get the appeal.<br>I can however see why parched desert travellers would tolerate it.*
| A type of cacti, 1ft tall and pointed oval in shape.<br>It is topped with a pink rose-like flower<br>that only opens during the full moon. |
| Beyond its barbed and leathery exterior lies a core of melon-like flesh. |
