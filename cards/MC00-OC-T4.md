| **State** |
| *Those who call the north the "Dragonbrand" have clearly never stepped foot there. To suggest that the clans work together is to ignore their rich traditions and culture.* |
| The most northern state of the [Nil'Savnic alliance](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/nilsavnic-alliance.md). Following [The Third Coming](../history/events/the-third-coming.md), only the dragonborn clans dared settle this mountainous and snowy region. Here they chose to revert to their ancestors' way of life - close-knit isolated and independent clan settlements. |
