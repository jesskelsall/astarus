| **Item** |
| **Dagger of Warning** |
| Dagger. 1d4 piercing. Finesse, light, thrown (range 20/60). |
| This magic weapon warns you of danger. While the weapon is<br>on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. |
| In addition, you or any of your companions within 30ft canâ€™t be surprised,<br>except when incapacitated by something other than non-magical sleep. |
| The weapon magically awakens you and your companions<br>within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins. |
