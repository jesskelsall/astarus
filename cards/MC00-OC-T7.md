| *Living a solitary life in [Lelxuuth](../places/settlements/cities/lelxuuth.md) doesn't make us the best explorers. Hence each Time Enlightened that heads out into the world benefits from a map of it.* |
| The [map of the Nil'Savnic Alliance](../../maps/map-of-the-nilsavnic-alliance.md) provides information on geography, settlements, and the boundaries of states. |
| It can be used to plan travel routes or understand the states at large. |
