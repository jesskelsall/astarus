| **Home State** |
| **[Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md)** |
| *Who doesn't dream of retiring to the [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) countryside as a farmer? I am blessed with childhood memories of the towers of [Hochwald](../places/settlements/cities/hochwald.md) shining across the lake.* |
| Nestled between three forests and the [Vourpain Peaks](../places/topography/mountains/vourpain-peaks.md), [Valburg](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/valburg.md) is known for its rolling fields, views of [Lake Gondra](../places/topography/rivers-lakes/lake-gondra.md), and its powerhouse agriculture. The wealth that flows into the state has led to an architectural renaissance that rivals the elven cities of [Reimatelau](../civilisations/nilsavnic-alliance/states/reimatelau.md) and the [Syntenne Republic](../civilisations/syntenne-republic/syntenne-republic.md).  |
